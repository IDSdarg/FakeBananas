The zone is separated from the rest of the city of 5 million by a network of police, military, and private security checkpoints.\\\\n\\\\nGet Today\\'s Headlines in your inbox: The day\\'s top stories delivered every morning.

And the Green Zone in Baghdad has, its critics maintain, created an out-of-touch ruling class and Western community, and provided a magnet for protests while just moving enormous bombings elsewhere, further stoking popular discontent with leaders and foreigners.\\\\n\\\\nThe Kabul Green Zone expansion, which will significantly restrict access, was prompted, according to both Afghan and American military officials, by a huge suicide bomb planted in a sewage truck that exploded at a gate of the current Green Zone on May 31, destroying most of the German Embassy and killing more than 150 people. The loss of life could have been far worse, but Germany had evacuated its embassy a week before the bombing, apparently tipped off by intelligence sources.\\\\n\\\\nThe military recently appointed an American brigadier general to take charge of greatly expanding and fortifying the Green Zone. In the first stage of the project, expected to take from six months to a year, an expanded Green Zone will be created -- covering about 1.86 square miles, up from 0.71 square miles -- closing off streets within it to all but official traffic.\\\\n\\\\nBecause that will also cut two major arteries through the city, in an area where traffic congestion is already rage-inducing for Afghan drivers, the plans call for building a ring road on the northern side of the Wazir Akbar Khan hill to carry traffic around the new Green Zone.\\\\n\\\\nIn a final stage, a still bigger Blue Zone will be established, encompassing most of the city center, where severe restrictions on movement -- especially by trucks -- will be put in place. Already, height restriction barriers have been built over roads throughout Kabul to block trucks. Eventually, all trucks seeking to enter Kabul will be routed through a single portal, where they will be X-rayed and searched.\\\\n\\\\nThe process of turning Kabul into a fortress started before Mr. Trump took office, of course -- security measures were tightened and an obtrusive network of blast walls was established in some places years before President Barack Obama left office.\\\\n\\\\nSome of the plans for long-term American assistance in Afghanistan were already in place, too, and have been enhanced. An ambitious $6.5 billion program to build a serious Afghan Air Force is scheduled to take until 2023. In Brussels last October, the United States and other donor nations agreed to continue $15 billion in development funding for the country through 2020.\\\\n\\\\nUnlike Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump has suggested that American forces would remain in Afghanistan until victory.\\\\n\\\\nBut even his own generals have conceded that a complete military victory in Afghanistan is not possible. The only solution most see is to persuade the Taliban to sit down to peace talks -- something they have refused to do as long as American soldiers remain in the country. And with the insurgents gaining ground steadily in the past two years, the Taliban have even less incentive to negotiate.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It seems America is not yet ready to end the longest war in its history,\\\\\" said the Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, after Mr. Trump announced his new policy. \\\\\"As Trump stated, \\'Americans are weary of the long war in Afghanistan.\\' We shall cast further worry into them and force American officials to accept realities.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe Afghan ambassador to Washington, Hamdullah Mohib, said that talking about how much longer Americans may stay in Afghanistan obscures how different the years to come will be from the first 16 years.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I think a lot of the discussions when people talk about American presence in Afghanistan, the memory comes of when they were actively involved in combat and bodies were coming back to the United States. That is no longer the case,\\\\\" Mr. Mohib said. \\\\\"The majority of those soldiers are helping us improve our logistics, organizational capabilities, putting systems in place. While yes, there is an element of counterterrorism operations, it\\'s largely airstrikes supporting the Afghan special forces.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nDespite the long-term scenario most military planners have embraced, there are still some dates that could disrupt the calendar. Next year, the country will hold elections for a new Parliament -- three years late -- but there are concerns that preparations for the elections will not be completed in time.\\\\n\\\\nAn even greater concern is the following year, 2019, when presidential elections are due. The last presidential election, in 2014, was a fiasco, and amid accusations of fraud and vote-rigging, the outcome ended up in an American-negotiated deal to form a shaky coalition government.\\\\n\\\\nThe United States may be willing to look past another tainted election, though the last one nearly devolved into factional conflict. Europe and the NATO allies, however, may be another matter; they have repeatedly insisted on clean and credible elections as a condition for continued support.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"This may be our last golden opportunity,\\\\\" said Haroun Mir, an Afghan political analyst. \\\\\"If we cannot solve our problems by 2019, if we move to an ethnic conflict, this may spread to the Afghan security forces, and that would undermine the entire U.S. effort in Afghanistan.\\\\\" He doubts the United States would stay if that happened.\\\\n\\\\nFor now, though, the Americans and their allies seem ready to dig in.\\\\n\\\\nThe Taliban have been fond of quoting an old Afghan saying: \\\\\"You have the watches, we have the time.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAfter Mr. Trump announced his new strategy, the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, used a televised speech to turn that expression on its head: \\\\\"The Taliban should go buy a watch,\\\\\" he said, because time was now on the government\\'s side.\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.nytimes.com\\\\/2017\\\\/09\\\\/16\\\\/world\\\\/asia\\\\/kabul-green-zone-afghanistan.html\"},\"2\":{\"source\":\"Asia Times\",\"text\":\"The emerging humanitarian crisis that has been rocking Myanmar - where an estimated 370,000 Rohingya have been forced out of the country - has prompted broad international condemnation. But so far it has translated into little concrete action.\\\\n\\\\nUnited Nations (UN) human rights chief Zeid Raad Al Hussein has called the Rohingya\\'s plight a \\\\\"textbook example of ethnic cleansing\\\\\" following a similar statement from UN Secretary General Ant\\\\u00f3nio Guterres. While Western countries have been slow and hesitant to respond, leaders of Muslim-majority countries - particularly Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan - have sought to place as much international pressure as possible on the Myanmar government.\\\\n\\\\nThe strongest and most vocal response of all has come from Turkey. Indeed the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appears to have appointed himself as the international voice of the Rohingya Muslims.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to a Turkish government statement, Erdogan is the first one that managed to get permission for humanitarian aid to enter Myanmar. The Burmese government had, at the peak of the violence, blocked all UN aid towards the Rohingyas.\\\\n\\\\nAnd so, on September 7, Turkey\\'s foreign aid agency, TIKA, became the first foreign outfit to deliver an initial shipment of 1,000 tons of basic foodstuffs and medicine to the conflict zone in Rakhine state, where the majority of Rohingyas live.\\\\n\\\\nTurkey simultaneously announced plans to distribute humanitarian aid to the Rohingya camps in Bangladesh. The move was widely publicized as Emine Erdogan, the Turkish president\\'s wife visited the camps at the same time.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, during a meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan, Erdogan as the current chief of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) formally condemned Myanmar\\'s attitude towards Rohingyas, taking the lead on the topic on behalf of the organization. He had previously called the ongoing violence a genocide.\\\\n\\\\nSince the crisis broke on August 25, the Turkish president has taken several actions to gather Muslim leaders across the world to put pressure on the Myanmar government. On August 31, he spoke with the leaders of Mauritania, Pakistan, Iran and Qatar urging them to join forces to find a way to stop the violence against the Rohingyas.\\\\n\\\\nAlongside Erdogan, other Turkish politicians have addressed the issue. Remarks by Mevlut Cavusoglu, the foreign minister, garnered global attention. Mehmet Simsek, deputy prime minister, even tweeted unrelated images to raise the point, creating a bit of an embarrassment.\\\\n\\\\nSo how are we to explain Turkey\\'s ambition to take the lead in this current crisis?\\\\n\\\\nThe political vacuum prompted by the Trump administration\\'s retreat from global leadership has surely played a part. But, more evidently, Turkey\\'s longstanding pro-Western approach has shifted. Turkey is a NATO member and aspired to join the EU for years, but under President Erdogan\\'s lead and the current AKP government, the country\\'s foreign policy has shifted towards the global south, seeking new opportunities.\\\\n\\\\nTurkey\\'s foreign policy doctrine now promotes what Bilkent University academics Pinar Bilgen and Ali Bilgic label \\\\\"civilizational geopolitics\\\\\", \\\\\"an understanding of culture and civilization as preordained determinants of international behavior\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nAs Bilgin and Bilgic argue, this new doctrine aims at placing Turkey at the core of geopolitical issues between the West and the rest of Asia, justifying this global engagement by its political heritage - mainly based on its Central Asian and Ottoman history.\\\\n\\\\nThe shift became most obvious at the end of the 2000s. It has been identified most closely with Ahmet Davutoglu, a scholar of geopolitics and Turkey\\'s foreign minister from 2009-14. In 2010 \\'Foreign Policy\\' called him \\\\\"the brains of Turkey\\'s global reawakening\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nUnder Davutoglu\\'s watch, Turkey\\'s global diplomatic footprint expanded dramatically, especially in Asia and Africa. He opened Turkey\\'s first embassy in Myanmar in 2012 both to take advantage of the potential trade opportunities from the country\\'s post-2008 liberalization and because of the Rohingya issue.\\\\n\\\\nA subsequent trip in 2013 saw him tour refugee camps and call on the Burmese government to extend citizenship rights to the Rohingya people. This new foreign policy coincides with Turkey\\'s decade-long ambition to become a global humanitarian power or what Turkish scholars E Fuat Keyman and Onur Zakak call a \\\\\"humanitarian state\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nThe Turkish humanitarian approach has been cast by journalist and former Somali Minister of Planning, Abdirahman Ali, as a middle way between the Western aid model and its Chinese counterpart. Whereas the former is highly conditional, bureaucratic and often security-focused and the latter tends to bolster corrupt, authoritarian regimes, the Turkish approach - Ali claims - typically bypasses bureaucracy and emphasizes \\\\\"a \\'moral\\' standard anchored in protecting human rights and helping the weak\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nTurkey has backed this ambition with increased funding for humanitarian assistance over the last five years. Development Initiatives - a UK based NGO - recently reported that now Turkey ranks second in the world for humanitarian aid, having spent around US$6 billion in 2016 (the top-ranked US spent $6.3 billion).\\\\n\\\\nOne of the other factors is domestic politics. Indeed, much of Erdogan\\'s public posturing on the Rohingya issue is entirely self-serving. The image of a strong Turkey reaching out to Muslim\\'s everywhere in the world - plays very well at home. During his 15-year tenure as Turkey\\'s leader, the country\\'s once-marginalized pious Muslim citizens have become increasingly prominent in media, business and politics.\\\\n\\\\nArdent supporters in Turkey - not to mention large segments of public opinion across the Muslim world - thus see him as a champion of Muslim rights everywhere.\\\\n\\\\nErdogan has studiously crafted this image throughout other crises, such as in Egypt\\'s during the 2011-12 Morsi regime or in Palestine. His very public spats with Israel and the West have led some pro-Palestinian columnists in Arabic newspapers to call him the \\\\\"new Nasser\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nNevertheless, in recent days there has been a modest push back from Saudi Arabia, which appears to be chaffing at Turkey\\'s leadership on the crisis. Saudi Arabia\\'s ambassador to Turkey released a statement emphasizing the Kingdom\\'s strong, decades-long support for the Rohingyas. Iran has followed too, promising shipments to reach Myanmar soon.\\\\n\\\\nErdogan has promised to raise the Rohingya issue on September 19, at the annual meeting of the UN General Assembly - which Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi is avoiding.\\\\n\\\\nHis calls to protect Muslims worldwide could be a key moment for Turkey\\'s diplomatic leadership but whether other Muslim countries would follow or not will tell the limits of Turkey\\'s so-called \\\\\"humanitarian politics\\\\\".\",\"url\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/www.atimes.com\\\\/article\\\\/turkey-rohingyas-erdogan-global-muslim-leader\\\\/\"},\"3\":{\"source\":\"southasiajournal.net\",\"text\":\"Turkish Muslims pray near Fatih Mosque in Istanbul during a protest against the attacks on the Muslim people in Arakan in Myanmar.

For international observers, the Russian leader is an unfathomable and enigmatic figure. He is rumoured to have a personal wealth worth billions and is said to enjoy access to luxury palaces and mega-yachts.\\\\n\\\\n\\'THE GREATEST THREAT\\' - Air Force Times\\\\n\\\\nAt first, the attack unfolds silently, weaving its way through cyberspace long before bullets fly. The drumbeat of disinformation builds in the Baltics. Russian-speaking residents hear through news outlets and social media messages that there are reasons to realign with the motherland. Nearby, Russian troops are hunkered down with hundreds of tanks and missiles in Belarus. Text messages, like paper leaflets in previous war propaganda falling from the sky, whisper, \\\\\"America won\\'t help you\\\\\" and \\\\\"NATO is not your friend.\\\\\" Russo-defiant Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko faces a Kremlin-backed coup. This unrest on the border will not stand, Russian President Vladimir Putin tells his countrymen. He cannot allow insecurity to grow into a threat. That\\'s where this hypothetical - but very plausible - scenario leads into a more traditional conflict: Internet-connected infrastructure shuts down, rockets crash into key targets, and the treads of Russian tanks chew up Baltic roads, bringing the deafening roar of war across all spheres. Estimates by think tank experts and career military leaders predict that a swift Russian push would claim cities in a matter of 36 to 60 hours. And Russia could keep rolling, gobbling up territory for the first 90 days, daring the U.S. and NATO to push back. This month, Russia is holding its military exercise in the country\\'s western district, which will involve one of the largest massing of Russian forces along Europe\\'s border since the fall of the Soviet Union. This event promises to keep U.S. and NATO military leaders on edge as Russians move 60,000 to 100,000 troops and 4,000 train loads of equipment toward the Polish and Lithuanian borders. Parts of the Russians exercise will be conducted on both sides of the Suwalki Gap, a key sliver of NATO territory that would likely be the focus of any initial Russian maneuver toward the Baltics. Army Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, commanding general of U.S. Army Europe, said earlier this year he will be closely watching what equipment enters Belarus, and, more importantly, what remains there afterward. Though North Korean nuclear threats have dominated the news for months, the slow burn of Russian territory grabs in eastern Europe, coupled with NATO criticism from President Donald Trump, create a scenario that could erupt at exactly the wrong time - when the United States is distracted and unprepared.\\\\n\\\\nSweden holds military exercise, practising ground, anti-aircraft and naval defense - 112.international\\\\n\\\\nRussian troops involved in West 2017 military drills will leave Belarus by October, as the maneuvers should be over by September 20.

Besides, Sweden also conducts its own large-scale military exercise; 20,000 NATO servicemen and civilians play the scenario of an attack on Gotland Island, practicing ground, anti-aircraft and naval defense.

Introduction of the UN peacekeeping mission to the occupied Donbas is wrong initiative on the part of Ukraine. Such opinion was expressed by the former U.S. ambassador to the UN John Bolton in his exclusive commentary for 112 Ukraine TV channel. \\\\\"I do not think there should be peacekeepers in Ukraine, which is a mistake from on Ukraine\\'s part. It means that you are increasing Russia\\'s involvement in Ukraine\\'s internal affairs. And Russia is a permanent member of the Security Council. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia gained an even greater international weight. Now the main dispute is not to freeze this conflict. If you want to restore sovereignty over the Donbas, the last thing Ukraine should do is allow peacekeepers here, \\\\\"the diplomat said. To resolve the conflict in the Donbas and fight against Russian aggression, Ukraine, according to Bolton, must demonstrate its readiness for this. \\\\\"Therefore, if Ukraine is ready to fight for its independence, it must now prepare for it, increase military support from the United States. I believe that Ukraine must do everything possible to reduce Russia\\'s pressure on it now. it is not enough, it should make much more effort, \\\\\"he said. Speaking about the possibility of obtaining lethal weapons from the U.S., Bolton said: \\\\\"I think that Ukraine should approach it diplomatically, I think this is still the best way at the moment for both Ukraine and the United States.\\\\\" As it was reported ealier Poroshenko together with the OSCE Secretary General coordinate approaches to deploying UN peacekeepers in Donbas.

The offer of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the deployment of the UN peacekeepers in Donbas is unacceptable and it will worsen the situation in the region. Former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen claimed this to 112 Ukraine within the Yalta European Strategy meeting in Kyiv. \\'We all stand for peace, peacekeeping force but the offer of Putin is unacceptable. His offer will not provide the peace but only worsen the situation. But let work on this issue, let make some efforts, let observe the border between Russian and Ukraine and stop the inflow of the Russian Armed Forces\\', he said. \\'President Poroshenko will come to New York the next week and my offer is that he should pay attention to the Putin\\'s offer\\', the former NATO Secretary General thinks. According to Fogh Rasmussen, the problem resides in the fact that Ukraine does not control the part of the border with Russia. \\'We have to deploy there the peacekeeping forces to control this part.

Speaking about the face-to-face negotiations with Russian president Putin and settling the Donbas conflict by one-on-one talks, Kuchma stressed that this prerogative belongs to Petro Poroshenko, \\'I think we should have negotiated with Russia since the very first days of the conflict.

But perhaps more strikingly, false alarms may prove more problematic for Putin than real ones. He is undoubtedly a \\\\\"security president,\\\\\" one whose legitimacy to a large extent rests on his perceived role as the guardian of Russia from threats foreign and domestic. Actual attacks, with all the terrible accompanying theater of flashing blue lights, bodies being loaded into ambulances, screaming children and crying mothers, tend to generate a rally-round-the-flag boost for him. His presidency was born in the apartment bombing blasts of 1999. Periodic incidents, including the recent St. Petersburg metro attack, have played to the sense that a strong hand was needed at the helm of government. This current campaign, especially if it continues, may prove a rather less useful challenge. First of all, it is beginning to make the organs of state security look incompetent. There is much they can do, from knocking on (or kicking down) the doors of the usual suspects to tracking down web searches for, say, the telephone numbers of relevant malls, schools and airports. Putin\\'s credibility as the man of action and the defender of Russia will not so much be damaged by this campaign, if it continues, so much as become less relevant. But none of this guarantees a result. And even if some convenient scapegoats are swept up, if the campaign doesn\\'t stop the Kremlin\\'s credibility is at risk. Of course, the best scapegoats are foreign ones, and already this is being mooted. It may well indeed be the case, but this is problematic. On the one hand, this plays to a familiar narrative of Russia embattled in a hostile world, but it is also an implicit acknowledgment of vulnerability. Blaming Kiev will be tempting, but would the Kremlin really want to admit that the Ukrainians can make Moscow stop trains and empty offices with a phone call? The other classic temptation is simply to lie, and again there have already been cases where local authorities have sought to present the evacuations as nothing more than drills. More generally, state media is downplaying the whole campaign, waiting for an authoritative steer from above. Yet for the hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly affected, and for the friends, families and workmates they will regale with their experiences, this is real.\\\\n\\\\nAnonymous Bomb Threats Continue In Moscow, St. Petersburg\\\\n\\\\nA series of anonymous bomb threats phoned in to authorities across Russia has&nbsp;continued with new threats in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

Ever since Vladimir Putin returned to the Kremlin in 2012, his regime has encouraged, manipulated, and utilized the most nationalistic, xenophobic, and nativist elements in society for political gain. It was just a matter of time before some of them went rogue. Now, the Kremlin claims to be shocked and appalled about the emergence of radical groups like Christian State. And the recent violence and threats of violence does create the appearance that the Putin regime is losing control over the Frankenstein monster it created.

But a new survey shows that many Russians don\\'t have a clear grasp on important facts. Today\\'s Kommersant summarizes the results of a new VTsIOM poll concerning Russians\\' knowledge about the 1917 revolution and related events. It found that 96 percent of Russians say they believe that \\\\\"it is important to know the history of Russia.\\\\\" But it also found that many in fact don\\'t (kommersant.ru\\\\/doc\\\\/3409875). Russians appear to be aware that this is the case, the survey found. Forty percent of them say they know their nation\\'s history \\\\\"poorly\\\\\" and seven percent more say their expertise is \\\\\"very poor.\\\\\" Only 41 percent say that they know it \\\\\"well.\\\\\" Among these, three percent say they know it \\\\\"very well.\\\\\" But when VTsIOM asked if they knew the answers to some specific questions, the level of Russians\\' knowledge was revealed as something less than one might have expected. Only 11 percent of Russians know that the Bolsheviks overthrew the Provisional Government. Sixty-five percent gave other answers, the most frequent was that \\\\\"the Bolsheviks overthrew the tsar.\\\\\" Only seven percent knew that Pyotr Stolypin was the author of the phrase, \\\\\"they need great turmoil, we need a great Russia.\\\\\" Eighty-three percent didn\\'t even hazard a guess, and the other ten percent got it wrong. Only nine percent knew the dates of the Russo-Japanese war, and not a single Russian queried knew the date when Russia left World War I. Young people do especially badly, and Mikhail Mamonov, a VTsIOM analyst, says that one of the reasons is that Russian schools have departed from the traditional methods of instructing history. As a result, he says, \\\\\"young people know and remember only what they have seen in films and on television.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Russia\\'s \\'Imperial Curse\\' Reflects Three Longstanding Trends, Inozemtsev Says\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, September 14 - Many speak about \\\\\"the imperial curse\\\\\" Russia has suffered from because of its enormous size and the consequences of which not only are very much in evidence now but likely to be for some time to come, Moscow commentator Vladislav Inozemtsev says. But size alone does not define that \\\\\"curse.\\\\\" Instead, three special features of the Russian imperial experience do, each of which now in \\\\\"ricochet fashion\\\\\" has come back to haunt the residents of that enormous space and can even be said to have played a key role in driving it into a dead end (afterempire.info\\\\/2017\\\\/09\\\\/14\\\\/damn\\\\/). First of all, the analyst says, there is \\\\\"the factor of time.\\\\\" If one takes the gradual colonization of Northwestern Rus by the Kievan state in the tenth century, the process has been going on \\\\\"more than a thousand years.\\\\\" If one dates it from the beginning of the 16th century, \\\\\"no less than five hundred.\\\\\" Even the second shorter period is unprecedented in modern times and is equaled only by the Roman Empire in classical ones. But the expansion was not only long but \\\\\"practically constant.\\\\\" It simply didn\\'t stop for any length of time during which the country might have consolidated itself. \\\\\"Therefore,\\\\\" Inozemtsev says, \\\\\"it is not so much the size of the territory as the unintending character of its increase that was Russia\\'s visiting card.\\\\\" Other empires had expanded in one direction while contracting in another. Russia didn\\'t have that experience and so the post-imperial stress syndrome it is feeling now is especially severe. Second, there is the factor of direction. Most sea-based empires evolve quickly, he points out, while continental empires \\\\\"can exist for thousands of years but in relatively stable borders.\\\\\" In this regard, \\\\\"Russia is an exception: having borrowed many Mongol practices for ruling space, it expanded precisely into territories located far from seaways.\\\\\" The idea of \\\\\"a heartland,\\\\\" which the British invented but which Russians have been guided by to this day, has played an evil trick on the Russian people: Today, \\\\\"about 70 percent of GDP is created on territories less than 100 miles from sea coasts.\\\\\" These form \\\\\"less than ten percent\\\\\" of the land surface of the planet but a far greater share of Russia\\'s space. According to Inozemtsev, \\\\\"Russia formed its own identity in the form of endless expansion\\\\\" without much regard for acquiring useful territory but rather focused on gaining territory as such. As a result, its leaders have assumed that their task is \\\\\"to struggle with nature rather than to take its special features into consideration.\\\\\" As a result, Russia has lost not only a geopolitical cold war but a banal one with cold as such, \\\\\"having constructed enterprises and cities in completely unsuitable locations and condemned itself to ineffectiveness without end.\\\\\" That in turn, the analyst says, makes Russia \\\\\"a completely uncontemporary country which can hardly be reformed.\\\\\" And third, Russians have viewed their expansion as something beyond discussion: the price of the acquisition of new territories is something that can\\'t be discussed; and the price or even benefit of losing others is something that can\\'t be borne, as the Hitler-Stalin Pact and the Crimean Anschluss show. \\\\\"Politicians and the people in Russia have not been interested and are not interested now by the economic and political losses they will be subject to by the latest expansion of the country. For that goal, almost all are practically prepared to do anything.\\\\\" And losses are inevitably treated as treason. That allows the Kremlin to manipulate Russians with ease. In Inozemtsev\\'s opinion, this likely means that \\\\\"Russia has no chances to transform its imperial essence and become a \\'normal\\' country,\\\\\" however desirable that would be\\\\\" for its own people and the world. At present that puts Russia on the outs with the rest of the world, but the situation may change in the future. And that means, the analyst continues, that \\\\\"even if Russia will not change its \\'imperial\\' position at some moment it may be in relative demand,\\\\\" in the same way that even a stopped clock is correct twice a day. Indeed, given the small chance that Russia can change, the real question about the Russian Empire is whether and when the rest of the world will.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Non-Russian Language Media Increasingly Dominates Daghestan, Undermining Moscow\\'s Influence There\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, September 14 - Russian officials are concerned that private media outlets in the various non-Russian languages of Daghestan now have move readers and viewers that Moscow ones and that Daghestanis prefer to get their news even about Russia as a whole from local sites, something these officials say represents \\\\\"a threat to national information security.\\\\\" That is how Sergey Snegiyev, Daghestan\\'s deputy information minister, described the situation at a conference in Kaspiisk earlier this week, noting that 53 percent of all Daghestanis turn to social networks for news and 30 percent read private republic-level media instead of Moscow outlets (kavkazr.com\\\\/a\\\\/dagestanskie-yazyki-v-internete\\\\/28733746.html). A major part of the reason for this is that many Daghestanis appear to prefer to read news in their native languages rather than Russian and that Makhachkala spends money to support such media outlets which in turn do what they can to make their newspapers and sites of particular interest to their target audience. But however that may be, the most important consequence of this trend is that Daghestan, the most Muslim of all the non-Russian republics in the Russian Federation, is moving away from the Russian information space at a speed and in ways that Moscow officials seem as yet incapable of controlling. That in turn highlights the importance of these non-Russian outlets not only for the population but also for those who would understand what is happening in Daghestan and other non-Russian republics. Russian-language sources are of declining value for both the population and the analytic community. And finally - and this may be something not far from the minds of many in both Moscow and Makhachkala - this shift from the Russian media to the non-Russian language media represents a recapitulation of what happened in many non-Russian union republics at the end of the 1980s, just before they became independent countries.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Potential for Protest in Central Asia on the Rise and is Increasingly Channeled via Islam, Scholars from Region Say\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, September 14 - The growing influence of Islam across Central Asia now threatens secularism there, scholars from that region said at a recent meeting in Almaty; and if the regimes don\\'t find a way to generate support for secular values among the Muslim community, they predict that troubled times\\\\\" are ahead for the region. The session was extremely unusual not only because it took place at all - such events have become increasingly rare in the last decade -- but also because speakers felt free to sharply criticize the views about Islam now current in both East and West and the policies of their own governments (exclusive.kz\\\\/kudai_b\\\\u0456led\\\\u0456_ili_mutnye_perspektivy_islamizacii_czentralnoi_azii; for additional details, see camonitor.kz\\\\/28891-kazahstan-islam-i-svetskost-chya-vozmet.html). Elmira Nogoybayeva, a Kyrgyz expert, told the group that one of the problems of talking about Islam in Central Asia is that there is no clear definition of what political Islam really is. Most outside groups and many politicians and commentators simply \\\\\"demonize\\\\\" the religion rather than consider what it is really about. If people go outside the major cities, she said, they will find that across Central Asia, \\\\\"the mosque is the main method of socializing the population regardless of age or gender.\\\\\" And despite what officials say, protest attitudes are growing from their already \\\\\"high\\\\\" position. Consequently, more demonstrations of various kinds can be expected. One reason many don\\'t see that is that they fail to understand that Islamic protest does not fit \\\\\"in the traditional definition of political opposition but rather within religion.\\\\\" Muslims vote with their feet as it were separating themselves from government functions rather than challenging them. This is quite a worrisome signal, Nogoybayeva continued, because it means that protest in Central Asia is already \\\\\"being channeled through religion\\\\\" rather than through any secular or civic institutions. Sardor Salimov, an Uzbek political analyst, said that in his country \\\\\"the rebirth of Islamic identity has occurred,\\\\\" with \\\\\"ever more people not simply conducting the rituals of the religion\\\\\" but trying to bring their society into correspondence with Islam and using Arabic to appeal to the Most High.\\\\\" Today, he added, \\\\\"a critical mass of mature and educated Muslims\\\\\" has arisen and is ready for action in the public sphere including in politics. \\\\\"Ever more activists from among Muslims are ready to demand that state policy be conducted in correspondence with Islamic values.\\\\\" This isn\\'t the end of secularism, of course; but it is a threat to its current state. Abdugani Mamadazimov, a Tajik scholar, reported that in his country Islamic identity not only competes with but often is stronger than the Tajik one. \\\\\"Perhaps we do not have VVP [a reference to Putin] but on the other hand we do have our traditions,\\\\\" of which Islam is one of the most important. Sanat Kushkumbayev, the deputy director of Kazakhstan\\'s Institute for Strategic Research, noted that the statistics about the number of mosques and mullahs show that Islam has been growing in his country but \\\\\"for a lengthy period, [it] was on the periphery of social progress.\\\\\" But now \\\\\"it is rapidly returning to the arena.\\\\\" The authorities are compounding the problem because they are approach Islam the way the Soviets did through the Muslim Spiritual Directorate (MSD) system, but that system which was all about control rather than cooperation retains its \\\\\"birthmarks\\\\\" and does little or nothing to promote cooperation or even conversation between Muslims and the state. Other speakers made equally intriguing interventions. One said that \\\\\"today no one is surprised when white Nazis become Islamists. This is a global alternative as in the time of fascism, liberalism or communism. One is thus speaking not about the politicization of Islam or the Islamization of politics but about protest.\\\\\" A second pointed out that in Central Asia, \\\\\"people are going into religion because there is no civil society or political parties. The authorities at one period though that worked to their benefit.\\\\\" But no longer, given that \\\\\"the limits of secularism and Islam are very fluid,\\\\\" as Turkey has shown recently. And a third said bluntly that in Central Asia today, \\\\\"secularism is in fact under threat. If governmental policies continue without change, then sooner or later Islam will take the place\\\\\" of their authors. \\\\\"Put simply, if the political base of secularism ... continues to contract and does not receive support from the umma, then Central Asia faces troubled times ahead.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Putin Personally Orchestrating Kadyrov\\'s Rising Status, Oreshkin Says\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, September 14 - Vladimir Putin is personally involved in boosting the status of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, seeing him as critical to maintaining order in the North Caucasus and possibly laying the foundation for the Chechen head to become Russian president not immediately but at some point in the future, Dmitry Oreshkin says. Some commentators have suggested that Kadyrov\\'s recent attacks on Myanmar for its ethnic cleansing of the Rohingja Muslims and his organization of demonstrations in Moscow and Grozny were not to Putin\\'s liking; but the Russian political analyst says that is a misreading of the situation (kavkaz-uzel.eu\\\\/articles\\\\/309524\\\\/). In fact, the two leaders have been in lock step, with Kadyrov simply taking advantage of the status that Putin wants him to have while recognizing that he must show loyalty to Putin in exchange, Oreshkin says. \\\\\"Kadyrov is a special political figure in Russia. In Russia now, too much depends on the first person and Kadyrov is [Putin\\'s] personal project.\\\\\" \\\\\"Kadyrov in turn understands perfectly well that for his political future he must demonstrate personal and \\'unlimited\\' loyalty in the negative sense of this word. The Chechen leader must not get into an argument with Putin,\\\\\" the Russian commentator continues. \\\\\"Neither in Ingushetia nor in Daghestan nor in any other region of the Caucasus or in Russia as a whole is there a politician who has such strong influence.\\\\\" His power is incomparably greater than that of the head of Tatarstan even though Tatarstan is a donor region and Chechnya is heavily subsidized. What makes it so clear that Putin is behind Kadyrov is that \\\\\"Kadyrov has many enemies especially among the siloviki\\\\\" and \\\\\"only Putin\\'s protection saves the Chechen leader. The president very much needs Kadyrov because the latter guarantees security.\\\\\" But that has consequences: \\\\\"with each year, Kadyrov\\'s ambitions only grow.\\\\\" His position in Moscow is rising as shown by his organization of the demonstration at the Myanmar embassy shows, and now he appears to be in a position to give orders to Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin.\\\\\" At the same time, Oreshkin says, \\\\\"Kadyrov wants to become a global leader of Islam. That\\'s useful for Putin\\\\\" as well. \\\\\"In addition, from Putin\\'s point of view, the Chechen leader may play a key role in keeping control over the rapidly growing Muslim population of the Russian Federation. In the immediate future, however, \\\\\"Kadyrov cannot become Putin\\'s successor,\\\\\" Oreshkin says. \\\\\"Now, this is impossible, but to the extent that Russia is moving quickly toward the side ... of an \\'Asiatic\\' form of rule,\\\\\" and Putin is showing himself ever more disposed toward the fuehrer principle of rule, \\\\\"Kadyrov is a clear representative of this style of administration.\\\\\" \\\\\"And to the extent that this \\'leader-centric\\' system of priorities will intensify and the less divided will power be into judicial, legislative, economic, military and ideological components and the more rapid will be the degradation of the state,\\\\\" Oreshkin concludes, \\\\\"the greater will be the chances that Kadyrov could occupy the place of the current president.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMoscow\\'s Invisible Grassroots - The Russia File\\\\n\\\\nThe round of voting that a few of Russia\\'s regions had last Sunday was both dull and promising. The elections, the majority of them regional and local, were non-competitive in most places and served the purpose of legitimizing Kremlin\\'s appointees as elected politicians. One interesting story was Moscow. It did not shake the ruling party\\'s positions but it did break the sleepy rhythm of Russia\\'s all-too-predictable elections. During the mayoral election of 2013, Alexei Navalny showed a grassroots alternative to the top-down campaigning the Kremlin habitually uses. This time a group of entrepreneurial political operatives who, just like Navalny, are not part of Russia\\'s Kremlin-dominated political circuit, introduced a way of making grassroots campaigning scalable. About a year ago Dmitry Gudkov, 37, a former member of the Russian Duma, and Maxim Katz, 33, a former municipal council member in one of Moscow\\'s districts, decided to take a crack at municipal council elections in Moscow. Local council members are essentially powerless but Gudkov and Katz decided to help many independent-minded Muscovites win a few of those mandates anyway. And their prot\\\\u00e9g\\\\u00e9s, many of them very young, did receive at least 266 mandates, which is a little over 15 percent of Moscow\\'s council seats. United Russia, the ruling party, won 1,154 seats. This is not a lot. Winning enough council seats is crucial. Having seats in all of the city\\'s 110 electoral districts allows one to break through the regional election filter. To register as a candidate for a gubernatorial election one has to collect a said number of supporters among municipal council members. The opposition campaign was not successful in achieving this. The number of seats won does not allow an opposition candidate to run for governor of Moscow in 2018 (Moscow is one of Russia\\'s federal regions, not just a city). The legislative hurdle created to prevent strangers from running for governors thus did its job. Nevertheless, the results are encouraging because of the novelty of the approach. The project leaders put together a united platform open for candidates from most movements independent from the ruling party. It is an incubator of sorts: a breeding ground for political campaigns rather than businesses.\\\\n\\\\nThomas Graham, Rajan Menon | The Putin Problem | Boston Review\\\\n\\\\nThe Putin Problem from Boston Review.

Despite all attempts by some opposition politicians to talk about the country\\'s hybrid occupation during these exercises, most of the Belarusians remain indifferent to this topic. September 8, oppositional National Congress of Belarus held an unauthorized protest action in the center of Minsk, which was attended by about 300 people. According to observers, such a small number of demonstrators shows that the majority of Belarusians are concerned about these exercises much less than their western neighbors. Politically active Belarusians paint a grim picture of possible results of the exercises, but most of their fellow citizens are not alarmed by these gloomy prospects. First, the Belarusians are sure that Lukashenko will not give his power (and consequently, Belarus\\'s sovereignty) to anyone, neither to his own oppositionists, nor to the Kremlin. Lukashenko, even under pressure from the Kremlin, has not even agreed to the deployment of a Russian military base in Belarus - why should he agree that Russian troops should stay here after the exercises? And how can 3,000 Russian servicemen, participants of West-2017, annex Belarus with its 65,000-strong army? Moreover, if we look pragmatically, there is no serious conflict between Minsk and Moscow, as there are no signs of an information war.\\\\n\\\\nKommersant daily: Lukashenka Does not Leave for Maneuvers in Russia - Charter\\'97 :: News from Belarus - Belarusian News - Republic of Belarus - Minsk\\\\n\\\\nThe ruler reassessed his plans. The Belarusian ruler will not likely be present on the Russian training area to inspect the West-2017 exercises. Kommersant reports referring to a military and diplomatic source. According to the source, initially it was assumed that Putin would arrive at the Russian training area together with the ruler of Belarus Aliaksandr Lukashenka. But, according to the latest information of Kommersant\\'s interlocutor, Lukashenka has reassessed his plans and, most likely, will not fly to Russia. Dmitry Peskov informed Izvestiya that Putin and Lukashenka would inspect the exercises at a Russian training area. Last time the leaders of two countries watched the maneuvers during the West-2013 exercises first in the Hrodna region (Belarus) and later in the Kaliningrad region (Russia). West-2017 exercises officially started on September 14 and will last until September 20. Many politicians as well as military experts believe that Russian troops will remain in Belarus after the exercises. A number of military training areas of Belarus will be involved (near Lepel, Barysau, Vitsebsk, Asipovichy, Ruzhany and Damanava). It is reported about planned raids on the \\\\\"territory\\\\\" near Dretun.

They were simply presented as a series of small exercises: infantry in Kaliningrad, aviation in Tver, paratroopers and engineer troops in Belarus, nuclear cruisers in the Baltic... Now the culmination of this grandiose military operation is coming. Putin and Lukashenka often behave like petty criminals who did not share something among themselves: noisy and effective quarrels, demonstrative threats, desperate bluff. In the press this is called gas, dairy and other wars. But now the moment of truth is coming which shows who is who. Speaking their language, it\\'s only the beginning. Don Putin has decided to convince the whole world that he is a badass dude and started these exercises. And yes-man Lukashenka pleasingly provided the territory of Belarus for tens of thousands of foreign soldiers. Many times our territory was \\\\\"visited\\\\\" by invaders. The central avenue of Minsk was renamed many times: Zakharievskaya Street, Nouvelle Ville, again Zakharievskaya Street, Hauptstrasse, Sovetskaya, Adam Mickiewicz and again Sovetskaya Street, and again Hauptstrasse, and again Sovetskaya, Stalin avenue, Lenin avenue, Francisk Skaryna avenue, Nezavisimosti avenue.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, after clarifying all the circumstances of Pavel Grib\\'s abduction, will determine the necessary steps regarding the security of Ukrainians in the territory of Belarus. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin said that in an interview to Ukrinform. \\\\\"The abduction of Pavel Grib on the territory of Belarus is a very serious matter, and we need to find out how it happened. To do this, we track information from different sources. Russia does not allow our consuls to Grib, but we will put pressure on them in all the possible ways, and as soon as we find out all the circumstances, further steps will follow,\\\\\" - Klimkin says. He notes that after Grib\\'s abduction, one should speak about the danger of the stay of Ukrainian citizens not only on Russian territory, but also in Belarus. \\\\\"Now we have seen a situation which proves that the Russian special services operate in Belarus, and I believe that Ukrainian citizens should think over how to travel there,\\\\\" - the minister says. Commenting on the exchange of harsh statements between the Foreign Ministry of Ukraine and Belarus, Klimkin notes that \\\\\"it is not the question, but that every country should control what is happening on its territory - this is a component of sovereignty.\\\\\" When asked whether the Foreign Ministry will also recommend Ukrainians to refrain from traveling to Belarus, as well as to Russia, Klimkin answers that these steps might be different. \\\\\"But we are worried about the safety of our citizens, therefore, despite political or other circumstances, as soon as we find out the situation, we will make further recommendations on how the Ukrainians can feel safe and who should take care of it,\\\\\" - Klimkin stresses. We remind that on August 28, military chaplain Igor Grib informed that his 19-year-old son Pavel went to meet a girl in Belarus on August 24 and disappeared. The Homel security forces told the father that his son was \\\\\"wanted for terrorist activities\\\\\" (the initiator was the FSB), but they did not confirm the detention. According to the girl, who Pavel visited in Homel, she had been forced to lure the Ukrainian to Belarus by the Russian special services. Later, on September 7, the Foreign Ministry confirmed that Grib was in the pretrial detention center of Russian Krasnodar, he was accused of terrorism.\\\\n\\\\nPavlo Hryb\\'s abduction by Russian special services in Belarus.

The Moldovan leader announced this at a briefing held in Chisinau, Ukrinform reports. \\\\\"Today I sent a letter to the Prime Minister rejecting the candidacy of Eugen Sturza for the post of Minister of Defense. Mr. Sturza is an incompetent man in the military sphere, with no professional skills to lead the army. I have proposed an alternative candidacy for a career military [and] former Moldovan Ambassador to NATO, General Victor Gaiciuc,\\\\\" noted Dodon. Speaking about the intentions of the ruling coalition to amend the Defense Law in order to transfer the authority to send Moldovan servicemen to the exercises from the president to the government, Dodon stressed that he would not sign the amended law, since issues related to the army and national security, according to the Constitution, are the jurisdiction of the president as Supreme Commander-in-Chief. Victor Gaiciuc was the Minister of Defense of Moldova in 2001-2004, during the reign of the Party of Communists. The evening prior, the ruling coalition in the country, which is led by the Democratic Party, nominated Eugen Sturza for the post of Minister of Defense of Moldova. Earlier, the Moldovan president dismissed Deputy Defense Minister Gheorghe Galbura, who also held the post of Minister, because Galbura sent Moldovan military to the Rapid Trident-2017 military exercises against Dodon\\'s will.\\\\n\\\\nUkraine Reports\\\\n\\\\nSignatures under Budapest Memorandum provide less security then nuclear weapon, - Poroshenko - 112.international\\\\n\\\\nSigns under Budapest Memorandum provide less security then nuclear weapon, - Poroshenko.

Moscow may cease maintaining the occupied Donbas since 2019. he separatist Ukrainian territories \\\\\"DPR\\\\\" and \\\\\"LPR\\\\\" from 2019 will stop receiving financing from the Russian budget. Russia\\'s Ministry of Finance at meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Dmytro Kozak on 1 September was instructed \\\\\"to exclude humanitarian assistance to individual territories in 2019-2020 from the draft federal budget for 2018 and for the planned period 2019 and 2020\\\\\", RBC news agency reported with a reference to a copy of the meeting\\'s minutes. By \\\\\"separate territories\\\\\" are meant \\\\\"DPR\\\\\" and \\\\\"LPR\\\\\", the agency notes. The financing of the \\\\\"DPR\\\\\" and \\\\\"LPR\\\\\" entirely completely classified, RBC says, and is regulated by secret government decrees, and \\\\\"closed lines in the budget\\\\\". Obviously, \\\\\"humanitarian assistance\\\\\" is only one of several channels of funding of the \\\\\"DPR\\\\\" and \\\\\"LPR,\\\\\" the RBC source said. At the very beginning of the conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014, the Russian government approved targeted subsidies for the restoration of the damaged infrastructure of Donbas (power, roads and railways), housing construction etc. In a secret government decree these subsidies were termed as \\\\\"humanitarian aid to certain territories of Ukraine\\\\\". These subsidies, the size of which is unknown, passed through the government\\'s reserve fund, the RBC source said. Russian government every year forms such fund to finance own expenditures. Most likely, the government\\'s move abolishes these targeted subsidies for the restoration of the infrastructure of Donbas, believes the source of RBC. The figures for possible Russian assistance to the \\\\\"DPR\\\\\" and \\\\\"LPR\\\\\" largely remain unclear. Bloomberg News has reported, citing sources in the \\\\\"republics\\\\\" that Russia\\'s monthly expenditures on pensions in \\\\\"DPR\\\\\" amount to 2.5 bn rubles. Russia\\'s Ministry of Finance later denied such expenditures from Russian budget. In February 2017 the Ukrainian Security Service claimed that the budget of the \\\\\"LPR\\\\\" in the first quarter of this year provided for 11 bn rubles in revenues, of which about 9 bn rubles is the assistance of the Russian government. Russia\\'s Ministry of Emergency Situations has delivered 68 humanitarian convoys to Donbas since August 2014 with more than 70 thousand tons of cargo, purchased for the funds outside the ministry budgets. In April 2017, the State Reserve has confirmed providing \\\\\"humanitarian assistance\\\\\" to metallurgical companies in the occupied territory of Donbas from its own budgets. However, the government in a while has allocated the State Reserve 10 bn rubles for the restoration of material reserve stocks in terms of raw materials for the steel industry. In addition, Russia, supplies electricity as the \\\\\"humanitarian assistance\\\\\" to the \\\\\"LPR\\\\\". The \\\\\"DPR\\\\\" budget indicates \\\\\"humanitarian aid\\\\\" as a source of revenue, but the size of the \\\\\"republics\\\\\" budgets has never been disclosed.\\\\n\\\\nRussia could cease humanitarian support for occupied areas of Donbas; the Kremlin does not plan sending \\'humanitarian convoys\\' to the militant-held sections in eastern Ukraine, sources in Russian government say - 112.international\\\\n\\\\nRussia could cease humanitarian support for occupied areas of Donbas; the Kremlin does not plan sending \\'humanitarian convoys\\' to the militant-held sections in eastern Ukraine, sources in Russian government say.

She said she hoped that President Poroshenko will sign the education bill into while language provisions are examined. Deputy Foreign Minister Vadym Prystayko, in turn, said that the meeting was attended by the ambassadors and representatives of embassies of 11 countries, as well as representatives of the EU, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. The new version of the law \\\\\"On Education\\\\\" stipulates that children who go to school on September 1, 2018, will have the opportunity to study in their native language in the first four years. Since the fifth grade, all subjects should be taught in Ukrainian. After the adoption of the law, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, Poland, Russia expressed their dissatisfaction with this rule.

They were convinced that their demands could be met only by signing the agreement, with its concrete obligations for Ukraine regarding democracy, the rule of law and human rights, and the considerable support it promised from the EU. A recent beyondbrics column focused on economic reforms and trade. This piece will discuss the agreement\\'s obligations regarding democracy and the rule of law, where the outlook is much less rosy. Following Ukraine\\'s ratification, the newly elected president, government, and parliament began pushing through long-overdue reforms. A first success was rapid macroeconomic stabilization by significantly decreasing the budget deficit and inflation and stabilizing the exchange rate. After deep recessions in 2014 and 2015, economic growth reached 2.3% in 2016 and could be 2.8% in 2017.\\\\n\\\\nUkraine should become energy hub for supply of Russian gas to Europe, - Sefcovic - Ukraine should become energy hub for supply of Russian gas to Europe, - Sefcovic - 112.international\\\\n\\\\nUkraine should become energy hub for supply of Russian gas to Europe, - Sefcovic\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Coal Shipment Arrives In Ukraine\\\\n\\\\nThe first shipment of coal from the United States has arrived in Ukraine, part of a deal between a Ukrainian state-owned energy firm and a Pennsylvania-based mining company.

Last month, the Iranian newspaper Sayeh has published the article under the title \\\\\"The situation of Muslims in Crimea is alarming.\\\\\" The article criticizes the global community for keeping silence against the background of repression of the Crimean Tatars. It traces the disasters these people suffered from Russian imperialism, most notably the Stalinist deportation of 1944. The protest against today\\'s injustice and support of the Crimean brothers in faith, the article underscores, is a human and Islamic duty of Shia and Sunni leaders, governments, and nations. The paper quotes Molavi Abdul Hamid Ismaeelzahi, an influential Iranian theologian and Sunni imam, who condemned Russian discriminatory policy in Crimea and called on the Kremlin to change the situation. Ukrainian diplomats have praised the Sayeh publication as an information victory. They link its appearance to the visit of the Iranian journalistic delegation to Kyiv in June 2017, when the guests were briefed about the outcomes of the Russian occupation of Crimea, particularly forced disappearances, murders, and lawless detentions of Crimean Tatars.\\\\n\\\\nUAWire - Ministry of Justice of Ukraine: There are no grounds to extradite Saakashvili\\\\n\\\\nMikheil Saakashvili, the former head of the Odessa Regional State Administration, will not be extradited from Ukraine until the criminal ...\\\\n\\\\nUAWire - Czech Republic says it is ready to help Ukraine gain its energy independence from Russia\\\\n\\\\nThe Czech Republic is ready to help Ukraine become an energy-secure country, as reported by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, ...\\\\n\\\\nRussia \\\\/ Iran \\\\/ Syria \\\\/ Iraq \\\\/ OEF Reports\\\\n\\\\nIran Nuclear Deal Critics Push Plan for \\'Global Economic Embargo\\' | Foreign Policy\\\\n\\\\nIran Nuclear Deal Critics Push Plan for \\'Global Economic Embargo\\' \\\\\" | Foreign Policy | the Global Magazine of News and Ideas\\\\n\\\\nIran produces propaganda video showing its forces destroying US Navy\\\\n\\\\nThe video depicts ordinary Iranian citizens destroying the U.S. Navy with a giant tidal wave.\\\\n\\\\nRussia, Turkey, Iran Agree On Borders Of Syrian \\'De-Escalation Zones\\'\\\\n\\\\nASTANA, Kazakhstan -- Negotiators from the three countries sponsoring Syria peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, say they have reached an agreement to set up de-escalation zones in Syria for six months...\\\\n\\\\nRussian Military, Not U.S., to Lead Battle for ISIS\\'s Final Major City in Syria\\\\n\\\\nWith forces led by Russia and the U.S. less than 10 miles from one another, the U.S. is stepping back to let the Syrian army take Deir Ezzor from ISIS.\\\\n\\\\nUS-backed Kurdish fighters will not enter Deir Ez-Zour city\\\\n\\\\nThe plan is not to go into the city, an official said.\\\\n\\\\nThe Aviationist \\\\\" Russia Has Deployed Its MiG-29SMT Multirole Combat Aircraft To Syria For The Very First Time\\\\n\\\\nThe Russian Air Force has deployed some MiG-29SMT multirole combat aircraft to Hmeymim airbase, near Latakia, in western Syria, the Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed on Sept. 13, 2017. It\\'s the first time the modernized version of the baseline Fulcrum jet is deployed to take part in the Syrian Air War. The MiG-29SMT is an upgraded variant of the MiG-29 featuring a big 950-litre spine CFT (Conformal Fuel Tank) and an in-flight refueling system on the left hand side of the cockpit: it is equipped with a \\\\\"glass cockpit\\\\\" with two MFI-10-6M displays and IKSh-1M HUD (Head-Up Display).

According to \\\\\"Russia\\'s Warplanes, Volume 1\\\\\" by Piotr Butowski published by Harpia Publishing, one of the most authoritative sources on Russian military aircraft and helicopters today, besides the baseline Fulcrum loadout, the MiG-29SMT can carry two R-27T medium-range IR-guided air-to-air missiles or two extended-range R-27ER\\\\/ET AAMs, or up to six RVV-AE AAMs. Air-to-ground weapons include two Kh-29T\\\\/L, up to four Kh-25M, or two Kh-31A7P missiles, or up to four KAB-500 guided bombs.

Rocket engines are not something a rogue scientist could smuggle in a suitcase like 25 grams of highly enriched uranium. It is a logistical undertaking of some scale that could not be pulled off without involving senior officials in Ukraine across such domains as security services, transportation, banking, the National Guard, and at Yuzhmash itself. While Ukraine has been plagued by systemic corruption, the Euromaidan revolution of 2014 has shaken up vested interests and old links between money and power have come undone, while new ones have taken shape. Delivery of financial compensation by North Korea, probably on the scale of tens of millions of dollars, is another issue that alone could unmask the entire operation. As Elleman rightly notes, Dripro, the home city of Yuzhmash, is close to the front lines of the war in eastern Ukraine. This does not mean, however, that people at Yuzhmash are leaving the gates open. Quite the opposite; since 2014, security at Yuzhmash has been significantly tightened; it is now guarded by the fully armed regiments of the Ukrainian National Guard. Rail traffic between Russia and Ukraine has been disrupted by war, and in May of this year Ukraine\\'s Security Council banned much of rail freight traffic from Russia on those routes that were still open. Smuggling between Ukraine and Russia has not become impossible but, counterintuitive as it may seem, the war and sudden change in people, power structures, and transportation routes make dealing in illicit rocket engines more difficult. The resemblance of HS-12 and HS-14 LPEs to RD-250, however, remains to be answered for. A plausible explanation is that either technical information or, as German analyst Norbert Br\\\\u00fcgge suggests, a whole R-36 missile was acquired by North Korea around the time of the Soviet Union\\'s collapse, giving Pyongyang ample time to reverse-engineer the engine with the required modifications, with or without the help of foreign experts. Br\\\\u00fcgge points out that a number of old RD-250s could have been scattered across the former Soviet realm. One other possible source of transfer, which has not been discussed yet, is the sites where decommissioned R-36s (Soviet missiles powered by the original RD-250 engines) had been sent for disassembly in the late 1980s, all of which are situated in Russia. Finally, one needs to consider that the RD-250 was developed by Russian Energomash, which now has a full set of the engine\\'s engineering documentation while also suffering from financial hardship. It is not our intention to point to those responsible for technology transfers to North Korea, given the paucity of available information about its nuclear program, but to remind that Elleman\\'s attribution of North Korea\\'s testing success to a recent transfer of RD-250 LPEs from Ukraine to North Korea is far less plausible than it may appear on the report\\'s first reading.

The numbers shown above represent the BBG\\'s collective funding and language reach, including the funding and language reach of RFE\\\\/RL and VOA.Calls to crack down on Russian \\\\\"disinformation campaigns\\\\\" have reached a fever pitch in the United States. Just this week, the Justice Department ordered the company that runs the U.S. version of RT, the Russian state-owned outlet originally known as Russia Today, to register as a foreign agent, signaling that all of its content would be labeled as propaganda from Moscow. Days earlier, Yahoo! News reported that the FBI has questioned two former staffers at the Russian state Sputnik news agency, as part of an ongoing investigation into a potentially undeclared propaganda campaign by the Russian government that violates America\\'s Foreign Agents Registration Act. Margarita Simonyan, the chief editor of RT and Rossiya Segodnya, has already warned that Moscow will likely take retaliatory measures against American journalists working in Russia, raising fears that registering reporters as foreign agents could become the next chapter in U.S.-Russian \\\\\"parity\\\\\" diplomacy.Though Simonyan didn\\'t say which \\\\\"American journalists\\\\\" Russian police would target, it\\'s a good bet that Moscow would start with reporters from RFE\\\\/RL and Voice of America. Both these outlets are funded and supervised by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), a U.S. government agency whose stated mission is \\\\\"to inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy.\\\\\"RFE\\\\/RL is designed to produce independent reporting and promote democratic values -- \\\\\"uncensored news, responsible discussion, and open debate\\\\\" -- in places where this kind of journalism is believed to be absent.

We\\'re talking about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and WikiLeaks ally, Craig Murray. No one is in a better position to know who actually took the emails than Assange, and yet, Assange has repeatedly said that Russia was not the source. Check out this clip from the report:\\\\n\\\\nAssange .... has been adamant all along that the Russian government was not a source; it was a non-state player. ...\\\\n\\\\nASSANGE: Our source is not a state party\\\\n\\\\nHANNITY (Conservative talk show host): Can you say to the American people unequivocally that you did not get this information about the DNC, John Podesta\\'s emails -- can you tell the American people 1,000 percent you did not get it from Russia...\\\\n\\\\nASSANGE: Yes.\\\\n\\\\nHANNITY: ... or anybody associated with Russia?\\\\n\\\\nASSANGE: We -- we can say and we have said repeatedly... over the last two months, that our source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party...\\\\n\\\\n(\\\\\"The Non-Existent Foundation for Russian Hacking Charge\\\\\", Skip Folden)\\\\n\\\\nCan you think of a more credible witness than Julian Assange? The man has devoted his entire adult life to exposing the truth about government despite the risks his actions pose to his own personal safety. In fact, he is currently holed up at the Ecuador embassy in London for defending the public\\'s right to know what their government is up to. Does anyone seriously think that a man like that would deliberately lie just to protect Russia\\'s reputation?\\\\n\\\\nNo, of course not, and the new report backs him up on this matter. It states: \\\\\"No where in the Intelligence Community\\'s Assessment (ICA) was there any evidence of any connection between Russia and WikiLeaks.\\\\\" The reason Assange keeps saying that Russia wasn\\'t involved is because Russia wasn\\'t involved. There\\'s nothing more to it than that.\\\\n\\\\nAs for the other eyewitness, Craig Murray, he has also flatly denied that Russia provided WikiLeaks with the DNC emails. Check out this except from an article at The Daily Mail:\\\\n\\\\n(Murray) \\\\\"flew to Washington, D.C. for emails....He claims he had a clandestine hand-off ... near American University with one of the email sources. Murray said the leakers\\' motivation was \\'disgust at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the \\'tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders\\'...\\\\n\\\\nMurray says: \\'The source had legal access to the information. The documents came from inside leaks, not hacks\\'. \\'Regardless of whether the Russians hacked into the DNC, the documents Wikileaks published did not come from that,\\' Murray insists.\\\\\" ....\\\\n\\\\nMurray said he was speaking out due to claims from intelligence officials that Wikileaks was given the documents by Russian hackers as part of an effort to help Donald Trump win the U.S. presidential election.\\\\n\\\\n\\'I don\\'t understand why the CIA would say the information came from Russian hackers when they must know that isn\\'t true,\\' he said. \\'Regardless of whether the Russians hacked into the DNC, the documents Wikileaks published did not come from that.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n(EXCLUSIVE: Ex-British ambassador who is now a WikiLeaks operative claims Russia did NOT provide Clinton emails\\\\\", Daily Mail)\\\\n\\\\nIs Craig Murray, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan and human rights activist, a credible witness?\\\\n\\\\nThere\\'s one way to find out, isn\\'t there? The FBI should interview Murray so they can establish whether he\\'s telling the truth or not. And, naturally, one would assume that the FBI has already done that since the Russia hacking story has been splashed across the headlines for more than a year now.\\\\n\\\\nBut that\\'s not the case at all. The FBI has never questioned Assange or Murray, in fact, the FBI has never even tried to get in touch with either of them. Never. Not even a lousy phone call. It\\'s like they don\\'t exist.\\\\n\\\\nWhy? Why hasn\\'t the FBI contacted or questioned the only two witnesses in the case?\\\\n\\\\nCould it be because Assange and Murray\\'s knowledge of the facts doesn\\'t coincide with the skewed political narrative the Intel agencies and their co-collaborators at the DNC what to propagate? Isn\\'t that what\\'s really going on? Isn\\'t Russia-gate really just a stick for beating Russia and Trump? How else would one explain this stubborn unwillingness of the FBI to investigate what one senator called \\\\\"The crime of the century\\\\\"?\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s something else from the report that\\'s worth mulling over:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It is no secret that NSA has the technology to trace a web event, e.g., a cyber attack, back to its source. There has been no public claim, nor is it implied in either Grizzly Steppe or the ICA that the NSA has trace routing to Russia on any of these purported Russian hacks.\\\\\" (\\\\\"The Non-Existent Foundation for Russian Hacking Charge\\\\\", Skip Folden)\\\\n\\\\nThis is a crucial point, so let\\'s rephrase that in simple English. What the author is saying is that: If Russia hacked the DNC computers, the NSA would know about it. It\\'s that simple.\\\\n\\\\nBut no one at the NSA has ever verified the claims or produced one scintilla of evidence that connects Russia to the emails. In fact, the NSA has never even suggested that such evidence exists. Nor has anyone in the media asked Director Michael Rogers point blank whether the NSA has hard evidence that Russia hacked the DNC servers?\\\\n\\\\nWhy? Why this conspiracy of silence on a matter that is so fundamental to the case that the NSA and the other Intel agencies are trying to make?\\\\n\\\\nThe only logical explanation is that there\\'s no proof that Russia was actually involved. Why else would the NSA withhold evidence on a matter this serious? It makes no sense.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the media, Intelligence agents familiar with the matter have \\\\\"high confidence\\' that Russia was involved.\\\\n\\\\nOkay, but where\\'s the proof? You can\\'t expect to build a case against a foreign government and a sitting president with just \\\\\"high confidence\\\\\". You need facts, evidence, proof. Where\\'s the beef?\\\\n\\\\nWe already mentioned how the FBI never bothered to question the only eyewitnesses in the case. That\\'s odd enough, but what\\'s even stranger is the fact that the FBI never seized the DNC\\'s servers so they could conduct a forensic examination of them. What\\'s that all about? Here\\'s an excerpt from the report:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The FBI, having asked multiple times at different levels, was refused access to the DNC server(s). It is not apparent that any law enforcement agency had access.\\\\n\\\\nThe apparent single source of information on the purported DNC intrusion(s) was from Crowdstrike.\\\\n\\\\n3. Crowdstrike is a cyber security firm hired by the Democratic Party.\\\\n\\\\n4. Not the FBI, CIA, nor NSA organizations analyzed the information from Crowdstrike. Only picked analysts of these agencies were chosen to see this data and write the ICA....\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n( \\\\\"The Non-Existent Foundation for Russian Hacking Charge)\\\\n\\\\nHave you ever read anything more ridiculous in your life? The FBI\\'s negligence in this case goes beyond anything I\\'ve ever seen before. Imagine if a murder was committed in the apartment next to you and the FBI was called in to investigate. But when they arrive at the scene of the crime, they\\'re blocked at the door by the victim\\'s roommate who refuses to let them in. Speaking through the door, the roommate assures the agents that the victim was shot dead with a single bullet to the head, and that the smoking gun that was used in the murder is still on the floor. But \\\\\"don\\'t worry\\\\\", says the obstructing roommate, \\\\\"I\\'ve already photographed the whole thing and I\\'ll send you the pictures as soon as I get the chance.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nDo you really think the agents would put up with such nonsense?\\\\n\\\\nNever! They\\'d kick down the door, slap the roommate in handcuffs, cordon-off the murder scene, and start digging-around for clues. That\\'s what they\\'d do. And yet we are supposed to believe that in the biggest case of the decade, a case that that allegedly involves foreign espionage and presidential treason, that the FBI has made no serious effort to secure the servers that were allegedly hacked by Russia?\\\\n\\\\nThe DNC computers are Exhibit A. The FBI has to have those computers, and they are certainly within their rights to seize them by any means necessary. So why haven\\'t they? Does the FBI think they can trust the second-hand analysis from some flunkey organization whose dubious background casts serious doubt on their conclusions?\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s a joke! The only rational explanation for the FBI\\'s behavior, is that they\\'ve been told to \\\\\"stand down\\\\\" so they don\\'t unwittingly expose the truth about what\\'s really going on, that the whole Russia hacking fiction is a complete and utter fraud, and that the DNC, the CIA and the media are all having a good laugh at the expense of the clueless American people.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s another interesting clip from the report:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Adam Carter: ...the FBI do not have disk images from any point during or following the alleged email hack. ... CrowdStrike\\'s failure to produce evidence. - With Falcon installed between April and May (early May), they should have had evidence on when files\\\\/emails\\\\/etc were copied or sent. - That information has never been disclosed.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n(\\\\\"The Non-Existent Foundation for Russian Hacking Charge\\\\\", Skip Folden)\\\\n\\\\nRead that excerpt over again. It\\'s mind boggling. What Carter is saying is that, they have nothing, no evidence, no proof, no nothing. If you don\\'t have a disk image, then what do you have?\\\\n\\\\nYou have nothing, that\\'s what. Which means that everything we\\'ve read is 100 percent conjecture, not a shred of evidence anywhere. Which is why the focus has shifted to Manafort, Flynn, Trump Jr and the goofy Russian lawyer?\\\\n\\\\nWho gives a rip about Manafort? Seriously?\\\\n\\\\nThe investigation started off with grave allegations of foreign espionage and presidential collusion (treason?) and quickly downshifted to the illicit financial dealings of someone the American people could care less about. Talk about mission creep!\\\\n\\\\nWhat people want is proof that Russia hacked the DNC servers or that Trump cozied up to Russia to win the election. Nothing else matters. All these diversions prove is that, after one full year of nonstop, headline sensationalism, the investigation has produced nothing; a big, fat goose-egg.\\\\n\\\\nA few words about the ICA Report\\\\n\\\\nRemember the January 6, Intelligence Community Assessment? The ICA report was supposed to provide iron-clad proof that Russia hacked Democratic emails and published them at WikiLeaks. The media endlessly reiterated the claim that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies took part in the assessment and that it\\'s conclusions represented the collective, objective analysis of America\\'s finest.\\\\n\\\\nRight. The whole thing was a fraud. As it happens, only four of the agencies participated in the project (the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.) and the agents who provided the analysis were hand-picked for the task. Naturally, when a director hand-picks particular analysts for a given assignment, one assumes that they want a particular outcome. Which they did. Clearly, in this case, the intelligence was tailored to fit the policy. The intention was to vilify Russia in order to further isolate a country that was gradually emerging as a global rival. And the report was moderately successful in that regard too, except for one paradoxical disclaimer that appeared on page 13. Here it is:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact. ... Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation, and precedents.\\\\\" ...\\\\n\\\\nWhat the authors are saying is that, \\'Everything you read in this report could be complete baloney because it\\'s all based on conjecture, speculation and guesswork.\\'\\\\n\\\\nIsn\\'t that what they\\'re saying? Why would anyone waste their time reading a report when the authors openly admit that their grasp of what happened is \\\\\"incomplete or fragmentary\\\\\" and they have no \\\\\"proof\\\\\" of anything?\\\\n\\\\nGregory Copley, President, International Strategic Studies Association (ISSA) summed it up best when he said: \\\\\"This is a highly politically motivated and a subjective report which was issued by the intelligence community. ... does not present evidence of successful or even an attempt to actually actively manipulate the election process.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nLike we said, it\\'s all baloney.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, Folden\\'s report sheds light on the technical inconsistencies of the hacking allegations. Cyber-forensic experts have now shown that \\\\\"The alleged \\\\\"hack\\\\\" was effectively impossible in mid-2016. The required download speed of the \\\\\"hack\\\\\" precludes an internet transfer of any significant distance.\\\\\" In other words, the speed at which the emails were transferred could only have taken place if they were \\\\\"Downloaded onto external storage, e.g., 2.0 thumb drive.\\\\\" (The report also provides evidence that the transfers took place in the Eastern time zone, which refutes the theory that the servers were hacked from Romania.)\\\\n\\\\nThe Nation summed it up perfectly in this brief paragraph:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"There was no hack of the Democratic National Committee\\'s system on July 5 last year -- not by the Russians, not by anyone else. Hard science now demonstrates it was a leak -- a download executed locally with a memory key or a similarly portable data-storage device. In short, it was an inside job by someone with access to the DNC\\'s system.\\\\\" (\\\\\"A New Report Raises Big Questions About Last Year\\'s DNC Hack\\\\\", Patrick Lawrence, The Nation)\\\\n\\\\nBingo.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line: A dedicated group of independent researchers and former Intel agents joined forces and produced the first hard evidence that \\\\\"the official narrative implicating Russia\\\\\" is wrong. This is a stunning development that will, in time, cut through the fog of government propaganda and reveal the truth. Skip Folden\\'s report is an important contribution to that same effort.\",\"url\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/www.eurasiareview.com\\\\/15092017-the-russian-hacking-story-continues-to-unravel-oped\\\\/\"},\"7\":{\"source\":\"asiancorrespondent.com\",\"text\":\"THE EMERGING humanitarian crisis that has been rocking Burma (Myanmar) - where an estimated 370,000 Rohingya have been forced out of the country - has prompted broad international condemnation.

The man has devoted his entire adult life to exposing the truth about government despite the risks his actions pose to his own personal safety. In fact, he is currently holed up at the Ecuador embassy in London for defending the public\\'s right to know what their government is up to. Does anyone seriously think that a man like that would deliberately lie just to protect Russia\\'s reputation?\\\\n\\\\nNo, of course not, and the new report backs him up on this matter. It states: \\\\\"No where in the Intelligence Community\\'s Assessment (ICA) was there any evidence of any connection between Russia and WikiLeaks.\\\\\" The reason Assange keeps saying that Russia wasn\\'t involved is because Russia wasn\\'t involved. There\\'s nothing more to it than that.\\\\n\\\\nAs for the other eyewitness, Craig Murray, he has also flatly denied that Russia provided WikiLeaks with the DNC emails. Check out this except from an article at The Daily Mail:\\\\n\\\\n(Murray) \\\\\"flew to Washington, D.C. for emails....He claims he had a clandestine hand-off ... near American University with one of the email sources. Murray said the leakers\\' motivation was \\'disgust at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the \\'tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders\\'...\\\\n\\\\nMurray says: \\'The source had legal access to the information. The documents came from inside leaks, not hacks\\'. \\'Regardless of whether the Russians hacked into the DNC, the documents Wikileaks published did not come from that,\\' Murray insists.\\\\\" ....\\\\n\\\\nMurray said he was speaking out due to claims from intelligence officials that Wikileaks was given the documents by Russian hackers as part of an effort to help Donald Trump win the U.S. presidential election.\\\\n\\\\n\\'I don\\'t understand why the CIA would say the information came from Russian hackers when they must know that isn\\'t true,\\' he said. \\'Regardless of whether the Russians hacked into the DNC, the documents Wikileaks published did not come from that.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n(EXCLUSIVE: Ex-British ambassador who is now a WikiLeaks operative claims Russia did NOT provide Clinton emails\\\\\", Daily Mail)\\\\n\\\\nIs Craig Murray, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan and human rights activist, a credible witness?\\\\n\\\\nThere\\'s one way to find out, isn\\'t there? The FBI should interview Murray so they can establish whether he\\'s telling the truth or not. And, naturally, one would assume that the FBI has already done that since the Russia hacking story has been splashed across the headlines for more than a year now.\\\\n\\\\nBut that\\'s not the case at all. The FBI has never questioned Assange or Murray, in fact, the FBI has never even tried to get in touch with either of them. Never. Not even a lousy phone call. It\\'s like they don\\'t exist.\\\\n\\\\nWhy? Why hasn\\'t the FBI contacted or questioned the only two witnesses in the case?\\\\n\\\\nCould it be because Assange and Murray\\'s knowledge of the facts doesn\\'t coincide with the skewed political narrative the Intel agencies and their co-collaborators at the DNC what to propagate? Isn\\'t that what\\'s really going on? Isn\\'t Russia-gate really just a stick for beating Russia and Trump? How else would one explain this stubborn unwillingness of the FBI to investigate what one senator called \\\\\"The crime of the century\\\\\"?\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s something else from the report that\\'s worth mulling over:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It is no secret that NSA has the technology to trace a web event, e.g., a cyber attack, back to its source. There has been no public claim, nor is it implied in either Grizzly Steppe or the ICA that the NSA has trace routing to Russia on any of these purported Russian hacks.\\\\\" (\\\\\"The Non-Existent Foundation for Russian Hacking Charge\\\\\", Skip Folden)\\\\n\\\\nThis is a crucial point, so let\\'s rephrase that in simple English. What the author is saying is that: If Russia hacked the DNC computers, the NSA would know about it. It\\'s that simple.\\\\n\\\\nBut no one at the NSA has ever verified the claims or produced one scintilla of evidence that connects Russia to the emails. In fact, the NSA has never even suggested that such evidence exists. Nor has anyone in the media asked Director Michael Rogers point blank whether the NSA has hard evidence that Russia hacked the DNC servers?\\\\n\\\\nWhy? Why this conspiracy of silence on a matter that is so fundamental to the case that the NSA and the other Intel agencies are trying to make?\\\\n\\\\nThe only logical explanation is that there\\'s no proof that Russia was actually involved. Why else would the NSA withhold evidence on a matter this serious? It makes no sense.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the media, Intelligence agents familiar with the matter have \\\\\"high confidence\\' that Russia was involved.\\\\n\\\\nOkay, but where\\'s the proof? You can\\'t expect to build a case against a foreign government and a sitting president with just \\\\\"high confidence\\\\\". You need facts, evidence, proof. Where\\'s the beef?\\\\n\\\\nWe already mentioned how the FBI never bothered to question the only eyewitnesses in the case. That\\'s odd enough, but what\\'s even stranger is the fact that the FBI never seized the DNC\\'s servers so they could conduct a forensic examination of them. What\\'s that all about? Here\\'s an excerpt from the report:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The FBI, having asked multiple times at different levels, was refused access to the DNC server(s). It is not apparent that any law enforcement agency had access.\\\\n\\\\nThe apparent single source of information on the purported DNC intrusion(s) was from Crowdstrike.\\\\n\\\\n3. Crowdstrike is a cyber security firm hired by the Democratic Party.\\\\n\\\\n4. Not the FBI, CIA, nor NSA organizations analyzed the information from Crowdstrike. Only picked analysts of these agencies were chosen to see this data and write the ICA....\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n( \\\\\"The Non-Existent Foundation for Russian Hacking Charge)\\\\n\\\\nHave you ever read anything more ridiculous in your life? The FBI\\'s negligence in this case goes beyond anything I\\'ve ever seen before. Imagine if a murder was committed in the apartment next to you and the FBI was called in to investigate. But when they arrive at the scene of the crime, they\\'re blocked at the door by the victim\\'s roommate who refuses to let them in. Speaking through the door, the roommate assures the agents that the victim was shot dead with a single bullet to the head, and that the smoking gun that was used in the murder is still on the floor. But \\\\\"don\\'t worry\\\\\", says the obstructing roommate, \\\\\"I\\'ve already photographed the whole thing and I\\'ll send you the pictures as soon as I get the chance.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nDo you really think the agents would put up with such nonsense?\\\\n\\\\nNever! They\\'d kick down the door, slap the roommate in handcuffs, cordon-off the murder scene, and start digging-around for clues. That\\'s what they\\'d do. And yet we are supposed to believe that in the biggest case of the decade, a case that that allegedly involves foreign espionage and presidential treason, that the FBI has made no serious effort to secure the servers that were allegedly hacked by Russia?\\\\n\\\\nThe DNC computers are Exhibit A. The FBI has to have those computers, and they are certainly within their rights to seize them by any means necessary. So why haven\\'t they? Does the FBI think they can trust the second-hand analysis from some flunkey organization whose dubious background casts serious doubt on their conclusions?\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s a joke! The only rational explanation for the FBI\\'s behavior, is that they\\'ve been told to \\\\\"stand down\\\\\" so they don\\'t unwittingly expose the truth about what\\'s really going on, that the whole Russia hacking fiction is a complete and utter fraud, and that the DNC, the CIA and the media are all having a good laugh at the expense of the clueless American people.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s another interesting clip from the report:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Adam Carter: ...the FBI do not have disk images from any point during or following the alleged email hack. ... CrowdStrike\\'s failure to produce evidence. - With Falcon installed between April and May (early May), they should have had evidence on when files\\\\/emails\\\\/etc were copied or sent. - That information has never been disclosed.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n(\\\\\"The Non-Existent Foundation for Russian Hacking Charge\\\\\", Skip Folden)\\\\n\\\\nRead that excerpt over again. It\\'s mind boggling. What Carter is saying is that, they have nothing, no evidence, no proof, no nothing. If you don\\'t have a disk image, then what do you have?\\\\n\\\\nYou have nothing, that\\'s what. Which means that everything we\\'ve read is 100 percent conjecture, not a shred of evidence anywhere. Which is why the focus has shifted to Manafort, Flynn, Trump Jr and the goofy Russian lawyer?\\\\n\\\\nWho gives a rip about Manafort? Seriously?\\\\n\\\\nThe investigation started off with grave allegations of foreign espionage and presidential collusion (treason?) and quickly downshifted to the illicit financial dealings of someone the American people could care less about. Talk about mission creep!\\\\n\\\\nWhat people want is proof that Russia hacked the DNC servers or that Trump cozied up to Russia to win the election. Nothing else matters. All these diversions prove is that, after one full year of nonstop, headline sensationalism, the investigation has produced nothing; a big, fat goose-egg.\\\\n\\\\nA few words about the ICA Report\\\\n\\\\nRemember the January 6, Intelligence Community Assessment? The ICA report was supposed to provide iron-clad proof that Russia hacked Democratic emails and published them at WikiLeaks. The media endlessly reiterated the claim that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies took part in the assessment and that it\\'s conclusions represented the collective, objective analysis of America\\'s finest.\\\\n\\\\nRight. The whole thing was a fraud. As it happens, only four of the agencies participated in the project (the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.) and the agents who provided the analysis were hand-picked for the task. Naturally, when a director hand-picks particular analysts for a given assignment, one assumes that they want a particular outcome. Which they did. Clearly, in this case, the intelligence was tailored to fit the policy. The intention was to vilify Russia in order to further isolate a country that was gradually emerging as a global rival. And the report was moderately successful in that regard too, except for one paradoxical disclaimer that appeared on page 13. Here it is:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact. ... Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation, and precedents.\\\\\" ...\\\\n\\\\nWhat the authors are saying is that, \\'Everything you read in this report could be complete baloney because it\\'s all based on conjecture, speculation and guesswork.\\'\\\\n\\\\nIsn\\'t that what they\\'re saying? Why would anyone waste their time reading a report when the authors openly admit that their grasp of what happened is \\\\\"incomplete or fragmentary\\\\\" and they have no \\\\\"proof\\\\\" of anything?\\\\n\\\\nGregory Copley, President, International Strategic Studies Association (ISSA) summed it up best when he said: \\\\\"This is a highly politically motivated and a subjective report which was issued by the intelligence community. ... does not present evidence of successful or even an attempt to actually actively manipulate the election process.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nLike we said, it\\'s all baloney.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, Folden\\'s report sheds light on the technical inconsistencies of the hacking allegations. Cyber-forensic experts have now shown that \\\\\"The alleged \\\\\"hack\\\\\" was effectively impossible in mid-2016. The required download speed of the \\\\\"hack\\\\\" precludes an internet transfer of any significant distance.\\\\\" In other words, the speed at which the emails were transferred could only have taken place if they were \\\\\"Downloaded onto external storage, e.g., 2.0 thumb drive.\\\\\" (The report also provides evidence that the transfers took place in the Eastern time zone, which refutes the theory that the servers were hacked from Romania.)\\\\n\\\\nThe Nation summed it up perfectly in this brief paragraph:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"There was no hack of the Democratic National Committee\\'s system on July 5 last year -- not by the Russians, not by anyone else. Hard science now demonstrates it was a leak -- a download executed locally with a memory key or a similarly portable data-storage device. In short, it was an inside job by someone with access to the DNC\\'s system.\\\\\" (\\\\\"A New Report Raises Big Questions About Last Year\\'s DNC Hack\\\\\", Patrick Lawrence, The Nation)\\\\n\\\\nBingo.\\\\n\\\\nBottom line: A dedicated group of independent researchers and former Intel agents joined forces and produced the first hard evidence that \\\\\"the official narrative implicating Russia\\\\\" is wrong. This is a stunning development that will, in time, cut through the fog of government propaganda and reveal the truth. Skip Folden\\'s report is an important contribution to that same effort.\\\\n\\\\nNote: Skip Folden is a Private Intelligence analyst and a retired IBM Program Manager for Information Technology.

But so far it has translated into little concrete action.\\\\n\\\\nUnited Nations (UN) human rights chief Zeid Raad Al Hussein has called the Rohingya\\'s plight a \\\\\"textbook example of ethnic cleansing\\\\\" following a similar statement from UN Secretary General Ant\\\\u00f3nio Guterres. While Western countries have been slow and hesitant to respond, leaders of Muslim-majority countries - particularly Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan - have sought to place as much international pressure as possible on the Myanmar government.\\\\n\\\\nThe strongest and most vocal response of all has come from Turkey. Indeed the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\\\\u011fan, appears to have appointed himself as the international voice of the Rohingya Muslims.\\\\n\\\\nTurkey\\'s aid response\\\\n\\\\nAccording to a Turkish government statement, Erdo\\\\u011fan is the first one that managed to get permission for humanitarian aid to enter Myanmar. The Burmese government had, at the peak of the violence, blocked all UN aid towards the Rohingyas.\\\\n\\\\nAnd so, on September 7, Turkey\\'s foreign aid agency, TIKA, became the first foreign outfit to deliver an initial shipment of 1000 tons of basic foodstuffs and medicine to the conflict zone in Rakhine state, where the majority of Rohingyas live.\\\\n\\\\nTurkey simultaneously announced plans to distribute humanitarian aid to the Rohingya camps in Bangladesh. The move was widely publicised as Emine Erdo\\\\u011fan, the Turkish president\\'s wife visited the camps at the same time.\\\\n\\\\nPublic denunciation\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, during a meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan, Erdo\\\\u011fan as the current chief of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) formally condemned Myanmar\\'s attitude towards Rohingyas, taking the lead on the topic on behalf of the organisation. He had previously called the ongoing violence a genocide.\\\\n\\\\nSince the crisis broke on August 25, the Turkish president has taken several actions to gather Muslim leaders across the world to put pressure on the Myanmar government. On August 31, he spoke with the leaders of Mauritania, Pakistan, Iran and Qatar urging them to join forces to find a way to stop the violence against the Rohingyas.\\\\n\\\\nAlongside Erdo\\\\u011fan, other Turkish politicians have addressed the issue. Remarks by Mevl\\\\u00fct \\\\u00c7avu\\\\u015fo\\\\u011flu, the foreign minister, garnered global attention. Mehmet \\\\u015eim\\\\u015fek, deputy prime minister, even tweeted unrelated images to raise the point, creating a bit of an embarassment.\\\\n\\\\nSo how are we to explain Turkey\\'s ambition to take the lead in this current crisis?\\\\n\\\\nGlobal ambitions\\\\n\\\\nThe political vacuum prompted by the Trump administration\\'s retreat from global leadership has surely played a part. But, more evidently, Turkey\\'s longstanding pro-Western approach has shifted. Turkey is a NATO member and aspired to join the EU for years, but under President Erdo\\\\u011fan\\'s lead and the current AKP government, the country\\'s foreign policy has shifted towards the global south, seeking new opportunities.\\\\n\\\\nTurkey\\'s foreign policy doctrine now promotes what Bilkent University academics Pinar Bilgen and Ali Bilgi\\\\u00e7 label \\\\\"civilisational geopolitics\\\\\", \\\\\"an understanding of culture and civilisation as preordained determinants of international behaviour\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nAs Bilgin and Bilgi\\\\u00e7 argue, this new doctrine aims at placing Turkey at the core of geopolitical issues between the West and the rest of Asia, justifying this global engagement by its political heritage - mainly based on its Central Asian and Ottoman history.\\\\n\\\\nThe shift became most obvious at the end of the 2000s. It has been identified most closely with Ahmet Davuto\\\\u011flu, a scholar of geopolitics and Turkey\\'s foreign minister from 2009-14. In 2010 Foreign Policy called him \\\\\"the brains of Turkey\\'s global reawakening\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nUnder Davuto\\\\u011flu\\'s watch, Turkey\\'s global diplomatic footprint expanded dramatically, especially in Asia and Africa. He opened Turkey\\'s first embassy in Myanmar in 2012 both to take advantage of the potential trade opportunities from the country\\'s post-2008 liberalisation and because of the Rohingya issue.\\\\n\\\\nA subsequent trip in 2013 saw him tour refugee camps and call on the Burmese government to extend citizenship rights to the Rohingya people. This new foreign policy coincides with Turkey\\'s decade-long ambition to become a global humanitarian power or what Turkish scholars E. Fuat Keyman and Onur Zakak call a \\\\\"humanitarian state\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nThe Turkish humanitarian approach has been cast by journalist and former Somali Minister of Planning, Abdirahman Ali, as a middle way between the Western aid model and its Chinese counterpart. Whereas the former is highly conditional, bureaucratic and often security-focused and the latter tends to bolster corrupt ,authoritarian regimes, the Turkish approach - Ali claims - typically bypasses bureaucracy and emphasises \\\\\"a \\'moral\\' standard anchored in protecting human rights and helping the weak\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nTurkey has backed this ambition with increased funding for humanitarian assistance over the last five years. Development Initiatives - a UK based NGO - recently reported that now Turkey ranks second in the world for humanitarian aid, having spent around US$6 billion in 2016 (the top-ranked US spent $6.3 billion).\\\\n\\\\nThe champion of Muslims\\' rights\\\\n\\\\nOne of the other factors is domestic politics. Indeed, much of Erdo\\\\u011fan\\'s public posturing on the Rohingya issue is entirely self-serving. The image of a strong Turkey reaching out to Muslim\\'s everywhere in the world- plays very well at home. During his 15-year tenure as Turkey\\'s leader, the country\\'s once-marginalised pious Muslim citizens have become increasingly prominent in media, business and politics.\\\\n\\\\nArdent supporters in Turkey - not to mention large segments of public opinion across the Muslim world - thus see him as a champion of Muslim rights everywhere.\\\\n\\\\nErdo\\\\u011fan has studiously crafted this image throughout other crisis, such as in Egypt\\'s during the 2011-12 Morsi regime or in Palestine. His very public spats with Israel and the West have led some pro-Palestinian columnists in Arabic newspapers to call him the \\\\\"new Nasser\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nCompetition ahead\\\\n\\\\nNevertheless, in recent days there has been a modest push back from Saudi Arabia, which appears to be chaffing at Turkey\\'s leadership on the crisis. Saudi Arabia\\'s ambassador to Turkey released a statement emphasising the Kingdom\\'s strong, decades-long support for the Rohingyas. Iran has followed too, promising shipments to reach Myanmar soon.\\\\n\\\\nErdo\\\\u011fan has promised to raise the Rohingya issue on September 19, at the annual meeting of the UN General Assembly - which Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi is avoiding.\\\\n\\\\nHis calls to protect Muslims worldwide could be a key moment for Turkey\\'s diplomatic leadership but whether other Muslim countries would follow or not will tell the limits of Turkey\\'s so-called \\\\\"humanitarian politics\\\\\".\",\"url\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/theconversation.com\\\\/turkey-the-rohingya-crisis-and-erdogans-ambitions-to-be-a-global-muslim-leader-83854\"},\"12\":{\"source\":\"DailySabah\",\"text\":\"Despite evidence and eyewitness statements on police brutality over unintentional border intrusion, Greek Cypriot authorities have kept Turkish national Mehmet Sapmaz in detention since Aug. 31, citing an ongoing probe over his complaint\\\\n\\\\nA Turkish national who was beaten by Greek Cypriot police for a brief and unintentional intrusion at a Nicosia border gate has entered the 13th day in his illegal detention as Greek Cypriot authorities have inexplicably prolonged his complaint process in a possible move to force him to retract his complaint.\\\\n\\\\n60-year-old Mehmet Sapmaz, who resides in Gazima\\\\u011fusa (Famagusta) in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), briefly crossed into Greek Cypriot territory on his bike at the famous Ledra Palace crossing without noticing the checkpoint on August 31.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough Sapmaz returned to the border soon after a police vehicle started chasing him, a police officer attacked him at the border gate and continued to assault the 60-year-old at the station.\\\\n\\\\nThe inhumane, violent and degrading treatment by the Greek Cypriot police was uncovered through the application of Greek Cypriot NGO the Movement for Equality, Support and Anti-Racism (KISA), which has since been backed by eyewitnesses\\' statements.\\\\n\\\\nAfter filing an application, Greek Cypriot watchdog the Independent Authority for the Investigation of Allegations and Complaints against the Police (AADIPA) launched an investigation into the matter.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough Greek Cypriot authorities have not charged him, Sapmaz has entered day 13 of detention through the administrative order of the Director of the Civil Registry and Migration Department, forced to spend the entire Qurban Bayram (Feast of the Sacrifice, also known as Eid al-Adha) away from his family.\\\\n\\\\nLawyer \\\\u00d6zge U\\\\u011fra\\\\u015f\\\\u0131n, who represents Sapmaz, told Daily Sabah that the biggest problem remains the fact that Sapmaz is being kept in custody while Greek Cypriot authorities investigate the complaint.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"As there are no legal proceedings against Sapmaz, there is no legal basis for his detention,\\\\\" said U\\\\u011fra\\\\u015f\\\\u0131n, who also represents the Turkish Cypriot Human Rights Foundation, adding that a habeas corpus application would be submitted before Greek Cypriot courts if Sapmaz\\'s detention did not end shortly.\\\\n\\\\nThe independent researcher previously assigned to the case said that the report over his complaint would be ended by September 8, but when that day came, the period was extended for another week, U\\\\u011fra\\\\u015f\\\\u0131n explained.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"If the report is concluded positively for the victim and backs his claims against the police officer, then he could be set free even if he does not carry a passport,\\\\\" U\\\\u011fra\\\\u015f\\\\u0131n said and added that it would allow the victim to launch a lawsuit against maltreatment and illegal detention in local courts.

The embassy relies on information coming from TRNC and U.N. authorities as well as technical committees established among the two Cypriot communities, the source noted.\\\\n\\\\nTRNC authorities will seek to visit Sapmaz tomorrow at the migration facility where he is being held in Greek Cypriot territory through U.N. channels, the source added.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to his lengthy detention, authorities intend to deport Sapmaz to Turkey through Greece, instead of facilitating his return to his family in the TRNC through cooperation with authorities at the U.N., as it is applied in special cases.\\\\n\\\\nTurkish nationals who cross into the south from the TRNC, only internationally recognized by Turkey, are subject to lengthy deportation procedures via Greece when apprehended by security forces in a process that usually takes five to seven days.\\\\n\\\\nThe north-south border dividing the island and capital Nicosia, a U.N. buffer zone known as the \\\\\"Green Line,\\\\\" has been calm over the last decade with only minor scuffles involving security forces and immigrants.

Waterborne tourism is expected to fetch VND540 billion (US$24 million) in revenue this year.\\\\n\\\\nNepal seeks tourism cooperation with HCM City\\\\n\\\\nTwenty-one Nepalese businesses operating in the aviation and tourism sectors recently visited Ho Chi Minh City to study potential tourism cooperation and sign agreements in this field with the locality.\\\\n\\\\nNepal is home to eight of the ten highest mountains in the world, including Mount Everest, dubbed the \\\\\"roof of the world,\\\\\" along with many historical and religious relic sites.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, the focus of the tourism cooperation will be climbing and spiritual tourism.\\\\n\\\\nAnil Lama, President of the Nepal Society of Travel and Tour Operators, said at an exchange programme in HCM City on September 10 that apart from exploring Mount Everest, visitors can take part in other activities like pilgrimages, boat rides and parachuting.\\\\n\\\\nSamsung, Panasonic face US$21mn in back taxes in Vietnam\\\\n\\\\nSamsung Vina Electronics and Panasonic AVC Vietnam may have to pay a combined total of over US$21 million in back taxes for incorrectly declaring imported liquid crystal (LC) films.\\\\n\\\\nThe possibility is being considered by the Ho Chi Minh City Customs Department, which recently requested consultation with the General Department of Vietnam Customs in a dispatch discussing the issue.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the dispatch, the two companies imported LC films worth a total taxable amount of VND16,056 billion (US$707.31 million).\\\\n\\\\nLC film is used in the production of liquid-crystal display (LCD) screens as well as LED displays, yet both firms declared it as zero-rated goods, attracting a favorable tax rate of zero percent.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, according to the municipal customs department, citing an earlier guideline by the General Department of Vietnam Customs, LC screens are listed in a three-percent tax category.\\\\n\\\\nUsing this rate of tariff, both Samsung and Panasonic would have been taxed VND481.68 billion (US$21.18 million) on their imported LC films.\\\\n\\\\nThe companies are refuting the suggestion, claiming that the guideline had only been circulated internally within customs agencies and not been made known to the public.\\\\n\\\\nLuu Manh Tuong, head of export-import tariff at the General Department of Vietnam Customs, told Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper Sunday, September 9, that it had reported the case to the Ministry of Finance and requested further instructions with regard to the potential collection of back taxes from both companies.\\\\n\\\\nTuong said Samsung Vina Electronics and Panasonic AVC Vietnam would not be liable for the amount if they are not found to be at fault for the incorrect declaration.\\\\n\\\\nIf that is the case, the companies would only need to ensure that future imports of LC films are declared under the new tariff rate, he added.\\\\n\\\\nExperts warn of high credit growth risks\\\\n\\\\nAs the Government is striving to obtain credit growth of 20% to 22% this year, many economic experts voiced their concerns over possible adverse impacts of high credit growth on businesses and the economy.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking at a recent seminar organized by HSBC Vietnam Bank, Tran Dinh Thien, head of the Vietnam Economics Institute and a member of the Prime Minister\\'s economic advisory group, said the Government has raised this year\\'s credit growth goal from 18% to 20-22%, a record high in five or seven years.\\\\n\\\\nIt is not difficult to obtain the target, but the Government should clarify the ultimate goal of the high credit growth, Thien said.\\\\n\\\\nLoan growth is supposed to speed up economic development. However, spurring credit up in the final months will not support gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year but in 2018. Meanwhile, next year could require different economic solutions.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, many enterprises are incapable of turning credit into business growth. Currently, the number of Vietnamese firms able to pay corporate income tax accounts for 33%, down sharply against several years ago, and meaning a vast number does not earn a profit.\\\\n\\\\nIt is necessary to improve business efficiency first before credit growth could bring about positive results, the expert explained. Besides, high credit growth will place inflationary pressure on the economy.\\\\n\\\\nCredit growth may result in high inflation as seen five years ago, when large volumes of loans were injected into the economy. Therefore, the Government is recommended to maintain credit growth at 18% or below to avoid inflation risks.\\\\n\\\\nBesides, there is a high risk that credit would flow into the property sector. Speculation remains a big issue in Vietnam, so banks may provide huge capital for the stock market and the real estate sector to achieve high credit growth goals, the expert said.\\\\n\\\\nNgo Dang Khoa, head of trading at HSBC Vietnam, said some VND600 trillion must be injected to the economy in the last four months of 2017 to obtain the credit growth rate of 20-22%.\\\\n\\\\nThe nation has seen huge dong liquidity but mostly due to VND160 trillion the State Treasury is keeping at banks. Liquidity will decline as the State Treasury will speed up disbursement from now to the end of this year.\\\\n\\\\nTo secure capital sources for reaching high credit growth, banks will have to hike interest rates to mobilize more from the public. Sustainable development in the future cannot be superseded by short-term growth, Khoa said.\\\\n\\\\nVN, South Africa discuss trade ties\\\\n\\\\nThe Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) and the South African Embassy in Viet Nam held a conference yesterday in Ha Noi to discuss the promotion of bilateral trade, investment and tourism, and future potential between the two countries.\\\\n\\\\nDoan Duy Khuong, VCCI\\'s Vice Chairman, said during the conference\\'s opening speech that at the moment, Viet Nam is considered South Africa\\'s top strategic partner in the South East Asian region.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking at the conference, Helen Zille, Premier of the Western Cape Province in South Africa, said that she was delighted to see the two nations reaching new heights in their trade relations.\\\\n\\\\nBilateral trade turnover between the two countries takes the lead among Viet Nam\\'s exports and imports with African partners; and South Africa is also considered Viet Nam\\'s hub to reach other African countries, as well as countries from the five major emerging national economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS), the G-20 and many other important international trade organisations, said Khuong.\\\\n\\\\nOver the past 10 years, total bilateral trade turnover between Viet Nam and South Africa has increased five times, from just over US$192 million in 2007 to over $1.03 billion as of the end of 2016; in which exports from Viet Nam to South Africa was worth more than $868 million last year, with imports at approximately $148 million, according to VCCI\\'s findings.\\\\n\\\\nChief exports from Viet Nam to South Africa include mobile phone parts and accessories, computers, electronics devices, footwear, rice, pepper, cashews, coffee, and furniture.\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, Viet Nam\\'s imports from South Africa chiefly range from industrial supply, textile materials, leather, chemical products, common metals and iron.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, in the past five months, South African firms have invested up to more than $100 billion into building infrastructure in Viet Nam, with hope of investing another $400 billion in the next 15 years.\\\\n\\\\nZille expressed her delight at such progress, stating that it would be a good opportunity for Vietnamese businesses to enhance collaboration, and push for imports in more prospective goods such as coffee or industrial cement.\\\\n\\\\nShe also stated that both Governments encourage firms to actively participate in maritime transportation and logistics to better facilitate bilateral trade. Simultaneously, she hoped that there would be better collaboration on human resource training and investment.\\\\n\\\\nThe VCCI also said that between the two countries, some industries would have more room for growth than others, such as mining, iron and steel processing, mineral extraction, wood and pulp manufacturing.\\\\n\\\\nViet Nam has been considering a more in depth cooperation with South Africa in the fields of thermoelectric power, automobile assembly, food processing, wine making and shale oil production.\\\\n\\\\nYesterday\\'s conference also featured discussions on the potential for tourism between the two countries. It is seen as a great chance for businesses to meet, exchange information, build networks and establish partnerships on all trade, tourism, culture and education relations between the two nations.\\\\n\\\\nThe conference was held on the occasion of Zille\\'s official visit to Viet Nam with 19 South African business delegates, working in various manufacturing industries ranging from household applications, electronic devices, coal, ore, canned goods to mining, wine making and water processing.\\\\n\\\\nHanoi mulls 6 cross-river projects worth US$2.5bn\\\\n\\\\nThe administration of Hanoi is seeking government approval for its development of six projects crossing the Red River and Duong River, costing a combined VND57 trillion (US$2.51 billion).\\\\n\\\\nThe first one is the Tu Lien Bridge, which runs three kilometers across the Red River and connects Hanoi\\'s Tay Ho and Dong Anh Districts.\\\\n\\\\nThe bridge is part of a nine-kilometer extension of the Hanoi - Thai Nguyen Expressway.\\\\n\\\\nThe second project includes the construction of the Thuong Cat Bridge and its access roads, which stretch 5.2 kilometers from an intersection with Belt Road 3 in Bac Tu Liem District to the Bac Thang Long industrial zone in Dong Anh.\\\\n\\\\nTran Hung Dao River Tunnel is the third project, running 3.1 kilometers from the border of Hoan Kiem and Hai Ba Trung Districts to Long Bien District on the other side of the Red River.\\\\n\\\\nIn the fourth project, the second phase of the existing Vinh Tuy Bridge will be constructed, fully linking Vinh Tuy Ward in Hai Ba Trung District to Co Linh Street in Long Bien District.\\\\n\\\\nThe Duong Bridge, measuring 1.4 kilometers in length, will be built across the Duong River, connecting Long Bien\\'s Duc Giang Ward with Yen Vien Town in Gia Lam District.\\\\n\\\\nThe final project will see the construction of the 5.4-kilometer Giang Bien Bridge and its access roads, running through Long Bien and Gia Lam Districts.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Hanoi\\'s administration, the proposed bridges and river tunnels would establish an inter-connection among its belt roads, and speed up the urbanization of its districts situated to the north of the Red River.\\\\n\\\\nHanoi has also requested government permission to employ special mechanisms in calling for private investments in these projects.\\\\n\\\\nWinter crops to span 410,000 ha in northern region\\\\n\\\\nNorthern provinces aim to cultivate the upcoming winter crop on 410,000 hectares, up 10,000 hectares from the same period last year.\\\\n\\\\nThe cultivation is hoped to yield an average of 65-70 million VND (2,860 - 3,080 USD) per hectare, with total production value hitting up to 28 trillion VND (1.23 billion USD).\\\\n\\\\nWeather forecasts for the crop are favourable, with abundant water from reservoirs making up for limited rainfall.\\\\n\\\\nAt a working session on the 2017 winter crop held by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on September 11, Nguyen Hong Son, head of the Cultivation Department, urged northern localities to use all necessary measures to attain the production area targeted.\\\\n\\\\nSon said apart from maize as the major plant for kernels and byproducts, attention should also be paid to fruit and vegetables with high commercial value.\\\\n\\\\nThe northern winter crop plays an important role in the agriculture sector in Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to a report by the Cultivation Department, cultivation area of the crop last year shrunk compared from 2015, but returned higher revenue of 25 trillion VND (1.1 billion USD), an annual increase of 2.7 trillion VND (118.8 million USD).\\\\n\\\\nInnovation exchange launched to serve Industry 4.0\\\\n\\\\nThe Novelind innovation exchange was launched yesterday with that aim of connecting individuals, organisations and companies with scientists to serve community development.\\\\n\\\\nIt has attracted the participation of more than 200 scientists from about 50 universities, research institutions and companies nationwide.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony, D\\\\u01b0\\\\u01a1ng Tr\\\\u1ecdng H\\\\u1ea3i, Head of the Industry 4.0 Institution at Nguy\\\\u1ec5n T\\\\u1ea5t Th\\\\u00e0nh University, and founder of the project, said that there was not yet a quality standard for research in Vi\\\\u1ec7t Nam. The Vietnamese economy requires initiatives serving Industry 4.0, however, the needs have not yet been satisfied.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Therefore, the exchange is a platform in which enterprises, authorities or individuals can seek initiatives by scientists. This is a stepping-stone in the formation of a technological ecosystem based on the three elements of Industry 4.0: research, education and manufacturing. Novelind is expected to create a technological market and favourable conditions to promote creativity and growth of enterprises, contributing to economic development,\\\\\" said H\\\\u1ea3i.\\\\n\\\\nThe exchange is also a destination for technological organisations to find the best technological solutions. Conversely, through Novelind, innovations developed by other individuals or agencies can be connected with those searching.\\\\n\\\\nNguy\\\\u1ec5n M\\\\u1ea1nh H\\\\u00f9ng, Principal of Nguy\\\\u1ec5n T\\\\u1ea5t Th\\\\u00e0nh University, highly appreciated the idea of Novelind.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It will be a huge success when the exchange attracts scientists in solving social issues. Therefore, Novelind needs the support from universities, research institutions and enterprises,\\\\\" said H\\\\u00f9ng.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Nguy\\\\u1ec5n Xu\\\\u00e2n H\\\\u00f2ai, Head of the Institute of IT Research and Development under H\\\\u00e0 N\\\\u1ed9i University, the exchange needs to solve financial, legal, technological and communication challenges. It should be a fair ground which brings equal opportunities for all stake-holders.\\\\n\\\\nV\\\\u0169 Anh Tu\\\\u1ea5n, Head of the Hoa Sen Group start-up community project, said that though it is an open space, the exchange should be transparent with an independent audit. It does not need rapid development but an excellent and socially-oriented management board.\\\\n\\\\nG-bond capital disbursed slowly\\\\n\\\\nCapital mobilised from the issue of G-bonds in the first eight months of this year was very positive, however, it was quite a contrast to the disbursement of the capital source.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the Ministry of Finance, total capital mobilised from G-bonds in the first eight months of this year reached nearly 144.1 trillion VND (6.34 billion USD).\\\\n\\\\nThe amount was equal to 78.6 percent of the annual plan.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, unlike the success of the G-bond mobilisation, the disbursement of the capital source in the period was very slow. Just 2.46 trillion VND (108.37 million USD) was disbursed, equal to only 4.9 percent of the plan.\\\\n\\\\nDue to the slow disbursement of public investment, including G-bond capital, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc had to ask authorities to take more drastic measures to rectify the late disbursement of investment capital for public projects.\\\\n\\\\nThirty ministries and provinces reported the slow disbursement of public investment, mainly due to the lack of proper direction by heads of ministries and localities, in addition to inadequacies of related procedures, slow land clearance and limited capacity of project contractors.\\\\n\\\\nThe PM noted that slow disbursement of public investment leads to a bottleneck in national economic growth and rising public debt.\\\\n\\\\nVietnamese tea exporters enjoy robust achievements\\\\n\\\\nVietnam\\'s tea exports in the first eight months of the year reached 90,000 tonnes, earning 142 million USD, up 12 percent in volume and 11.8 percent in value compared to the same time last year, according to the Vietnam Tea Association.\\\\n\\\\nTea was sold at nearly 1,570 USD per ton on average, down 1.5 percent from last year.\\\\n\\\\nPakistan imported the most tea from Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\nOther top tea consumption markets included India, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan (China).\\\\n\\\\nTea exporters said that there is an abundance of raw materials thanks to safe cultivation applied in all tea zones nationwide.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam, South Africa seek to foster trade, investment ties\\\\n\\\\nA workshop was held in Hanoi on September 11 to further promote Vietnam-South Africa trade, investment and tourism cooperative relations.\\\\n\\\\nIn his opening speech, Doan Duy Khuong, Vice Chairman of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), said Vietnam is now a leading partner of South Africa in Southeast Asia, with bilateral trade increasing fivefold in the past decade from 192 million USD in 2007 to 1.03 billion USD in 2016.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam has mainly shipped phones and components, computers, electronic products, footwear, rice, cashew nuts, coffee and wooden products to South Africa, while imported plastics, garment-textile and footwear materials, chemical products, metals and steel from the African country, he said.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam and South Africa still have potentials for stronger cooperation in such industrial sectors as mining, steel manufacturing, logging, and pulp producing. Vietnam is considering the possibility of partnership with South Africa in thermal power, auto production and assembly, foodstuff processing and beverages, among other sectors.\\\\n\\\\nHelen Zille, Premier of Western Cape province, who is leading a business delegation to Vietnam, expressed her delight at the fruits of Vietnam-South Africa trade ties, but saying that economic ties have yet to be on par with potentials and expectations of both nations.\\\\n\\\\nZille suggested Vietnamese and South African enterprises work together to tackle difficulties in transport costs and regional economic downturn, and urged them to take the initiative in seeking partners.\\\\n\\\\nShe said the two governments have encouraged cooperation between marine shipping and logistics firms to facilitate import and export activities.\\\\n\\\\nThe official said in the past five years, South Africa has invested more than 100 billion USD in infrastructure development and planned to pour an additional 400 billion USD into this field in the next 15 years. This will open up an opportunity for Vietnamese businesses to boost export of products such as cement, she added.\\\\n\\\\nCa Mau works to promote fishery sector\\\\n\\\\nThe Mekong Delta province of Ca Mau has applied a number of measures to boost the development of the local fishery sector as part of efforts to optimise local advantages.\\\\n\\\\nIn implementing a project on restructuring the agriculture sector, with a breakthrough in shrimp farming, the province has encouraged locals to apply ecological shrimp farming models as well as models meeting international standards.\\\\n\\\\nCa Mau has also offered financial assistance to fishermen in building and upgrading vessels.\\\\n\\\\nThe province currently has 91 vessels eligible for receiving the support. Commercial banks in the locality have to date signed lending contracts with 32 ship owners with total loans of 325 billion VND.\\\\n\\\\nSu Van Minh, Vice Chairman of the People\\'s Committee of Tran Van Thoi district, said the district has launched 18 ships newly built with the support, joining the fleet of 2,300 ships of the locality.\\\\n\\\\nMinh said that the locality will continue upgrading the capacity of the fleet, while setting up fishing cooperatives and multiply outstanding models in the field.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the provincial People\\'s Committee, total seafood output of the province in the eight months of 2017 fetched 339,500 tonnes, equal to 64 percent of the yearly target, up 3.5 percent year on year, including 109,330 tonnes shrimps, a rise of 5.6 percent.\\\\n\\\\nAlongside, the province\\'s catch reached 137,200 tonnes, including 9,530 tonnes of shrimp. Total seafood exports of Ca Mau hit over 616 million USD.\\\\n\\\\nJapanese firms seek investment opportunities in Ha Nam\\\\n\\\\nA business delegation from Hyogo prefecture and Kobe city of Japan held a working session with leaders of northern Ha Nam province on September 11 to inquire about the local investment environment.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking at the event, Secretary of the provincial Party Committee Nguyen Dinh Khang said Ha Nam is now home to 60 Japanese firms, accounting for one-third of the total number of foreign-invested enterprises in the province, with a total registered capital of over 560 million USD, mostly in mechanical engineering, automobiles, motorbikes and supporting industry.\\\\n\\\\nHa Nam highly evaluated the competence and cooperation of Japanese businesses and expected more Japanese investors to carry out projects in the province, Khang said.\\\\n\\\\nVice Chairman of the provincial People\\'s Committee Vu Dai Thang briefed the guests about the province\\'s economic potentials and investment attraction policies, with priority given to high-tech and supporting industries.\\\\n\\\\nHe said the Dong Van III industrial park with a favourable location and modern infrastructure is reserved for Japanese investors.\\\\n\\\\nIn agriculture, Ha Nam has advocated attracting investment in high-tech agricultural zones, apart from health care, education and training, and tourism, he said, adding that upon investing in the locality, businesses will receive assistance in electricity, water, workforce recruitment and security and order in line with the province\\'s 10 commitments to investors.\\\\n\\\\nShiro Muramoto, a special advisor of Kobe city\\'s commercial centre, said the visit aims to seek business opportunities in Ha Nam.\\\\n\\\\nHe said a number of firms in Kobe and Hyogo are interested in doing business in the province.\\\\n\\\\nAPEC members discuss fostering small firms\\\\n\\\\nFostering micro, small and medium-sized enterprises is considered one of the keys to generating growth and innovation in the APEC region, heard a forum on start-ups and MSMEs held on Monday on the sidelines of the 24th APEC Small and Medium Enterprises Ministerial Meeting being held in HCM City.\\\\n\\\\nThe forum was a platform for entrepreneurs, business experts, investors and regulators from APEC economies to discuss support for MSMEs and start-up businesses such as enabling them to innovate, integrate and access the global value chain right among other issues.\\\\n\\\\nIt also enabled the APEC members to share experiences, ideas and tools to support businesses and start-ups to form a vibrant and networked bloc-wide community.\\\\n\\\\nThere are 110 million MSMEs in APEC, accounting for 98 per cent of all business and 70 per cent of exports and employing 54 per cent of the population.\\\\n\\\\nCanadian ambassador to Viet Nam, Ping Kitnikone, said though MSMEs play an imporAPECtant role in the growth of all member economies, they are still facing many challenges as they tend to stay local and small.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Therefore, they need support to realise their growth potential such as on how to take risks, attract businesses, access regional and global markets.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Hoang Van Dung, chairman of the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC), 75 per cent of Viet Nam\\'s companies are small or medium-sized, and they are facing difficulties in expanding and accessing finance and the global value chain.\\\\n\\\\nHe made three recommendations to help grow MSMEs in the region, which will be submitted to the APEC Economic Leaders\\' Meeting in November 2017 in Da Nang.\\\\n\\\\nHe said the first is to enhance MSMEs global presence through the digital economy since \\\\\"e-commerce and ICT services offer MSMEs opportunities to enhance competitiveness and innovation to further access international markets and overcome obstacles in trade.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSecond is to help MSMEs access finance as it is one of the biggest challenges preventing them from joining the global market, he said.\\\\n\\\\nHe said one of the ways to resolve this problem is by APEC member economies engaging more in setting up financial services and enabling regional dialogues on fintech and finance education.\\\\n\\\\nThird is to foster women entrepreneurship by starting training courses to equip them with skills, enhance their capacity and networking to achieve leadership positions, especially economic roles, and connecting women entrepreneurs in the region to empower more women to build businesses, he said.\\\\n\\\\nReports from the World Bank and ILO show that 47.4 per cent of women in the East Asia and Pacific region partly own firms as compared to the global average of 34.4 per cent.\\\\n\\\\nThough in Viet Nam there is 73 per cent participation in the labour force by women, the pay gap between men and women is large and widening.\\\\n\\\\nThe forum resumes today with more round-table discussions on building a start-up eco-system, entrepreneurship education and training, and finance and business consultancy services for start-ups in the region.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the forum, a joint statement on promoting start-ups and MSMEs will be presented to the SME ministerial Meeting.\\\\n\\\\nAPEC delegates discuss hurdles to supply chain finance\\\\n\\\\nProviding micro, small and medium enterprises with access to financial services as a means of promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth and employment is very important since they still find it difficult to get the financing they need to grow and create jobs, the APEC SME Finance Forum heard in HCM City on Monday.\\\\n\\\\nNguyen Hoa Cuong, chair of the APEC SME Working Group and a senior official in the Ministry of Planning and Investment, said in his opening speech: \\\\\"MSMEs stimulate domestic demand through job creation, innovation and competition, and are thus a driving force behind a resilient national economy. In addition, SMEs in global supply chains promote international trade.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Prioritising SMEs\\' development is therefore critical for promoting inclusive economic growth. This priority for APEC 2017 will help maintain important momentum to advance APEC\\'s work with regard to MSMEs.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBut lack of access to finance is a major barrier to their growth, he said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Given the diversified nature of SMEs, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for SME finance. However lending sophistication and the diversification of financing modalities can help SMEs access the right type of finance for their evolving needs along their growth path.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nJulius Caesar Parrenas, APFF coordinator, APEC Business Advisory Council, and senior advisor at the Japanese-based Nomura Research Institute, told Viet Nam News: \\\\\"The traditional sources of finance have been banks, but it has been very difficult for SMEs to access finance through banks, mainly because most developing countries in the region do not have the financial infrastructure, a system to implement or credit information.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"And so from the point of view of banks, it is very difficult for them to lend to SMEs because of the risks involved due to the underdevelopment of the financial market infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Now that is being addressed and APEC is doing a lot about it, but in the meantime the question is: what are the sources we can tap to finance SMEs?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"And so we are looking at the innovation space. There has been a lot of innovation in the financial sector, which opens up a lot of opportunities for SMEs to access finance.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAt the first session of the forum, titled \\\\\"Challenges of SME finance and the recent innovations around the Asia Pacific region\\\\\", speakers reflected on the difficulties faced by SMEs in obtaining funding and took stock of significant recent innovations in the region, especially in digital finance, and discussed the associated challenges.\\\\n\\\\nHow to organise and optimise receivables and inventory finance by leveraging the chain relationships and the role of supply chain finance in the SME finance market were also highlighted.\\\\n\\\\nA session on \\\\\"Scaling up supply chain finance to strengthen SME competitiveness and innovation\\\\\" reviewed the developments in supply chain finance in the Asia-Pacific region.\\\\n\\\\nIt discussed the main lessons from developing a sustainable and inclusive supply chain finance market, the value-addition that supply chain finance provides in building competitive eco-systems, whether supply chain finance benefits SMEs to the desired extent, how supply chain finance can be best used to strengthen SME competitiveness and innovation, and how APEC economies can leverage more cross-border supply chain finance to deepen regional economic integration.\\\\n\\\\nAt another session on \\\\\"Developing electronic supply chain finance platforms in the digital age\\\\\", delegates discussed the increasing movement of supply chains online together with their financial institutions, as a result of which electronic supply chain finance platforms have emerged strongly in some markets.\\\\n\\\\nThey also discussed if these platforms have fulfilled their promises in general, made supply chain finance easier and cheaper for SMEs with the digital channels and helped more SMEs participate effectively in global and regional supply chains.\\\\n\\\\nThe last part of the forum, a panel discussion, considered the way forward and what more could be done to promote the development of supply chain finance and electronic supply chain finance platforms.\\\\n\\\\nDelegates heard that these could involve further policy and regulatory reforms and sector capacity building or at the level of specific supply chain finance providers.\\\\n\\\\nJapanese firm gets customs priority status\\\\n\\\\nThe General Department of Customs (GDC) has recognised Japanese printer manufacturer Fuji Xerox Hai Phong Co Ltd in the northern port city of Hai Phong, as a priority enterprise.\\\\n\\\\nThis status gives the company access to special customs incentives, which will enable the firm to conduct fewer procedures, get tax refunds first while checking is performed later, have goods cleared quickly and establish a single goods declaration system for multiple exports and imports.\\\\n\\\\nUnder Circular 72\\\\/2015\\\\/TT-BTC, regulating the application of a priority policy for customs procedures, customs inspection and the supervision of exported and imported goods by enterprises, businesses need to have more than US$100 million worth of export and import turnover per year to be considered a priority enterprise.\\\\n\\\\nThe conditional annual export revenue of an agricultural and fisheries company is $30 million.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, companies that manufacture goods for export in Viet Nam can be considered for this status if they earn $40 million in revenue per year.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the GDC, priority enterprise status applied for Fuji Xerox would last for three years. If this term expires but the company still meets the required conditions, the term can be extended.\\\\n\\\\nFuji Xerox Hai Phong was established in VSIP Hai Phong Industrial Zone in Thuy Nguyen District in 2012 with a capital of $36 million, making it one of the largest foreign direct investment companies in the city.\\\\n\\\\nThe company specialises in the manufacture and export of laser printers, digital electronic copiers, laser scanners, and related components.

Quang Ninh\\'s position among the top five localities reflected the active involvement of the entire political system in the province.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the chairman, Quang Ninh has developed its own Department and District Competition Index (DDCI), which contributed to enhancing the competition capacity of local agencies and authorities and was applauded by the business community.\\\\n\\\\nChairman of Texhong group Hong Tianzhu said the group chose Quang Ninh for its investment as it received attention and timely support of the local authority, as seen through the rapid land clearance and technical infrastructure building. The group was also satisfied with the short duration of dealing with administrative procedures.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2017, Quang Ninh attracted a series of tourism projects from major economic groups such as Sun Group, Vingroup and FLC, with total investment capital amounting to 100 trillion VND.\\\\n\\\\nThe province is accelerating the pace of several transport plans to create stronger momentum for economic activities, such as a highway connecting to the Hanoi-Hai Phong highway, the Van Don international airport and the Van Don special administrative-economic zone.\\\\n\\\\nQuang Ninh has emerged as a cradle of daring ideas and reform models, said Vu Tien Loc, Chairman of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI). He cited as examples the building of a public administrative centre to improve public services and the establishment of an independent investment promotion agency. The province has also been able to get the community and businesses involved in reform efforts by giving them the power to assess the performance of management agencies and authorities through the DDCI.\\\\n\\\\nAs early as 2015, Quang Ninh deployed the model \\\\\"Business cafe\\\\\" which sought to connect State management agencies and enterprises and provide a venue for interaction and open talks between authorities and business community. The model proved to be a success in bringing authorities and businesses closer and promote dialogue between the sides.\\\\n\\\\nThe provincial authorities have also been holding quarterly discussions with the business community, while assigning People\\'s Committees at lower levels to hold regular meetings with local enterprises in order to timely address their problems.\\\\n\\\\nChairman of the Quang Ninh Business Association Pham Van The said the meetings at local level give more firms the opportunities to come face-to-face with relevant agencies and have their difficulties heard.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to maintain its high ranking in the national PCI, Quang Ninh is aware that there is more it has to do. The province can be considered a model of success thanks to its strong shift in the way of thinking, from managing to serving the business community and considering businesses as long-term cooperative partners in local economic development.\\\\n\\\\nQuang Ninh drew in more than 47 million USD in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the first six months of 2017.\\\\n\\\\nThe sum came from two new and six existing projects, raising the number of valid FDI projects in the province to 58, with total registered capital worth over 2.3 billion USD.\\\\n\\\\nThe gross regional domestic product (GRDP) of the province expanded by 9.6 percent in the first half of this year as compared with 9.2 percent in the same period last year.\\\\n\\\\nIn the first quarter, the province\\'s GRDP grew 8.3 percent while the figure recorded in the second quarter was 10.7 percent, the fastest pace since 2012.\\\\n\\\\nWith the performance, Quang Ninh has been listed as one of the leading cities and provinces in the northern key economic region and nationwide as well.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to reach the target of a 10 percent growth rate, the province will focus on drastically instructing the implementation of socio-economic development tasks and solutions set for 2017.\\\\n\\\\nVinaCapital follows up strategy by divesting Vina Square\\\\n\\\\nVinaLand, the real estate arm of VinaCapital, has announced divesting its stake in the Vina Square project located in Ho Chi Minh City.\\\\n\\\\nVina Square has a total land area of approximately three hectares and was acquired by VinaLand in 2007, when the land was designated as a future development site.\\\\n\\\\nVinaLand is divesting its entire stake in the project to Tri Duc Real Estate Company Limited, a Vietnamese development company for net cash proceeds of approximately $41.2 million, including the repayment of shareholder loans, resulting in an IRR of 3.3 per cent to VinaLand.\\\\n\\\\nThe total valuation is recorded at 0.3 per cent above the June 30, 2017 unaudited net asset value and 13.5 per cent above the unaudited net asset value at the time of VinaLand\\'s extraordinary meeting in November 2016. Both figures include adjustments for additional investments up to the date of exit.\\\\n\\\\nAt the time of this announcement, $41.0 million or 99.5 per cent of the net proceeds have been received by VinaLand. It is expected that the full proceeds will be received by the end of this month.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking of the transaction, managing director David Blackhall stated that, \\\\\"This divestment is in accordance with the current policy to divest projects in a controlled and orderly manner, and steady progress has been made with further pipeline disposals.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The proceeds received from this disposal will, in conjunction with collections from earlier disposals including prepayment advances for future pipeline disposals, will be used to cover VinaLand\\'s commitments on operating costs, capital contributions, and further distributions to shareholders,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nAgriTech accelerator for Mekong Sub-region launched\\\\n\\\\nA new agritech accelerator will harness entrepreneurship and technology to transform the Mekong region\\'s agricultural industry into a leading global supplier of \\\\\"safe and nutritious food for all\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nThe MATCh: The Mekong Agriculture Technology Challenge Startup Accelerator will support startups in agriculture to develop their products, network and learn from industry players, showcase their solutions, and access markets and funding.\\\\n\\\\nIt is aimed at innovative early stage agritech startups and traditional agriculture businesses with new, scalable business models in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"MATCh is an important initiative, as entrepreneurship and technology are key to enhancing the competitiveness, inclusiveness, and sustainability of the Mekong region\\'s agricultural industry,\\\\\" said Mr. San Vanty, Under Secretary of State at Cambodia\\'s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries.\\\\n\\\\nAn additional MATCh Market Access Accelerator will help mature international agritech companies to expand into the Mekong region.

It is the latest in a series of innovation accelerators by the Mekong Business Initiative (MBI), which also pioneered the MIST (Mekong Innovative Startup Tourism) accelerator earlier this year. MBI launched MATCh with funding and support from the Australian Government and the Asian Development Bank.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"By supporting the innovative business models that this program will create, we can promote efficacy enhancing and environmentally-friendly agricultural technologies that also improve farmer livelihoods,\\\\\" said Mr. Dominic Mellor, Senior Economist at the Asian Development Bank and Head of MBI.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Future Food Asia, the open innovation platform developed by ID Capital, is partnering with MBI in MATCh because we share a common vision of fostering startup-driven innovations to bring more sustainability in the food system in the Asia-Pacific region,\\\\\" said Ms. Isabelle Decider, CEO of ID Capital.\\\\n\\\\nThe Asian Development Bank and the Australian Government jointly launched the MBI in 2015. It catalyzes private sector development in emerging ASEAN markets, focusing on Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam. The program aims to improve the business-enabling environment in these four emerging ASEAN markets, with particular focus on business advocacy, alternative finance, and innovation.\\\\n\\\\nPhilippines\\' AC Energy keen on renewables in Vietnam\\\\n\\\\nAC Energy Holdings Inc., the power generation unit of conglomerate Ayala Corp., has unveiled a plan to build renewable energy plants with a combined capacity of several hundred megawatts in Vietnam over the next two to three years.\\\\n\\\\nAC Energy\\'s President Mr. John Eric Francia said the company was in talks with several potential partners in Vietnam to implement the strategy. The move to look for potential renewable projects in Vietnam is part of its thrust to reach 2,000 MW of attributable capacity by 2020, with half coming from renewable energy projects.\\\\n\\\\nMr. Francia said that while the company was open to all types of technologies, it was keenly interested in renewable energy. \\\\\"The market in Vietnam is growing in the double digits and my view is that there is a need for greater supply,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"They have no reserve margin with double digit growth, so are in need of additional investment.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAffirming that Vietnam was offering positive investment opportunities, he said he was hoping that a deal would be finalized soon. \\\\\"We are trying our best,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nCurrently with 1,300 MW of capacity, including 300 MW of renewable energy, AC Energy recently acquired Bronzeoak Clean Energy, one of the leading renewable energy developers, having built over 250 MW of solar and biomass projects, as well as San Carlos Clean Energy.\\\\n\\\\nAyala Corp., the Philippines\\' oldest conglomerate, entered Vietnam in 2008 through its subsidiary Manila Water\\'s $44-million water loss reduction project in Ho Chi Minh City.\\\\n\\\\nIt became a strategic investor in the Ho Chi Minh City Infrastructure Investment Joint Stock Co. (CII), the leading infrastructure developer in the southern city, in 2012, and now holds an 8.8 per cent stake in CII via its unit VIP Infrastructure Holdings Pte. Ltd. Through Manila Water, Ayala now owns a 38 per cent stake in Saigon Water Infrastructure JSC (SII).\\\\n\\\\nVietnam is trying to generate enough energy to sustain the country\\'s growth and to connect the millions of people who still do not have access to power, while gradually shifting towards clean and low-carbon energy. Last year, the government revised down its output target for coal-fired power plants to 53.2 per cent of the country\\'s total power generation by 2030 from the previous 56.4 per cent.\\\\n\\\\nThe country is aiming to produce 10.7 per cent of its total electricity through renewable energy by 2030, mainly through solar and wind energy, up from 6 per cent previously. In May this year, the government issued long-anticipated regulations on solar energy projects.\\\\n\\\\nA raft of incentives to support renewable energy will be in place to June 2019 and have been dubbed a \\\\\"landmark\\\\\" in the country\\'s solar energy outlook. Other than exemptions on import duties and incentives including breaks in taxes and land use fees for solar power projects, raising the bid price to purchase solar energy to 9.35 US cents per kWh is a key measure.\\\\n\\\\nMost recently, the Ministry of Industry and Trade has asked the government to raise the buying price for wind power in an effort to help investors cover high input costs, suggesting that the price should be lifted to 8.7 US cents per kWh for wind energy projects on land and 9.95 US cents per kWh for offshore plants.\\\\n\\\\nSince 2011, the buying price for wind energy has stood at 7.8 US cents for all land-based projects in Vietnam, with 6.8 US cents paid by State-run power monopoly Electricity of Vietnam (EVN), and the remainder coming from the country\\'s Environment Protection Fund. For the country\\'s only offshore plant, in the Mekong Delta province of Bac Lieu, the current price is 9.8 US cents per kWh.\\\\n\\\\nAppropriate growth plan considered for 2018\\\\n\\\\nThe Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) has outlined three scenarios for economic growth in 2018, in preparation for the next year\\'s socio-economic development plan with GDP growth expected to be at 6.4-6.8%.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the Head of MPI\\'s Department for National Economic Issues Tran Quoc Phuong, the three scenarios for the 2018 development plan were developed by the MPI on the basis of the estimates made in 2017, forecasts for the global and domestic economy in 2018, and taking into account the objectives of the five-year, socio-economic, development plan during 2016-2020, as well as the direction given by the Prime Minister on the development of the socio-economic development plan for 2018, with expected GDP growth at 6.4-6.8%.\\\\n\\\\nThe MPI also set a forecast economic growth target of 6.7% for 2017, which is considered to be \\\\\"achievable\\\\\", and formally reported to the Government on three economic growth scenarios for 2018. In particular, in a low growth scenario, GDP is expected to grow by 6.4%; in an average scenario, the growth rate will stand at 6.5%; and in the high scenario, the growth rate is expected to be 6.81%.\\\\n\\\\nThe three scenarios have been developed but amidst the projection for 2018 and the following years, in which the mining sector may continue to decline which will affect the country\\'s growth and while the current economic model cannot move right away, the MPI believes that in the above scenarios, the medium scenario is the most suitable option.\\\\n\\\\nThis proposal has also received the support of many cabinet members. It is likely that the 2018 socio-economic development plan will be developed with a GDP growth target of 6.5%, a reasonable growth rate.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to setting growth targets for the coming year, the focus of socio-economic development in 2018 is consistently identified as \\\\\"ensuring macroeconomic stability, controlling inflation and creating a stable foundation for economic development,\\\\\" Tran Quoc Phuong added.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, the 2018 plan also targets moving gradually towards the implementation of economic restructuring and deploying three strategic breakthroughs in order to create new growth engines, thereby re-impacting and creating macroeconomic stability on a higher scale and level.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, it aims to continue to promote the growth of relevant sectors and branches, creating favourable conditions for economic development in the following years, and striving to achieve the five-year, socio-economic, development plan\\'s objectives set for 2016-2020.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough there are positive and optimistic signals for the economy in 2018, it cannot be denied that a number of difficulties and challenges are waiting ahead. One of the most visible challenges is the possibility of achieving a 6.7% growth target this year. If this target is not met, it will affect the set achievement for implementing the economic growth target for the coming year.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, during the regular government monthly meeting for August 2017, the Prime Minister repeatedly emphasised that: \\\\\"All ministries, sectors, localities and corporations must continue to scrutinise again the set target and drastically strive to fulfill it. Industry, agriculture and services, including tourism, should remain focused; if lagging behind for even one month, the 6.7% target may not be met.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the MPI, the difficulties and challenges for 2018, besides the objective factors, are also issues related to the internal weaknesses of the economy, including the economic model being based mainly on cheap labour and at a low-tech level; land and natural resources are gradually depleting, while the efficiency of land use has not increased significantly; whilst domestic enterprises are still limited in terms of scale and operating capacity, leading to restrictions in competitiveness.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, new difficulties may also arise, as the synergy for economic growth provided by oil, gas and coal, and Samsung\\'s contribution and remittances are leveraged and unlikely to increase. This issue, in combination with a limited fiscal and monetary policy and difficulty in raising capital for development, will have a significant impact on the 2018 economic growth.\\\\n\\\\nIn this regard, Director of Central Institute for Economic Management Nguyen Dinh Cung said that the growth of the economy relies heavily on the development of the business sector, but the private sector still faces many difficulties. According to statistics, only one third of private enterprises are profitable. If in next year the salary rate and a series of costs increase, they would affect the business efficiency of this sector; therefore, the number of profitable enterprises would reduce and thus affect economic growth.\\\\n\\\\nIt is necessary to reconsider the economic efficiency of the \\\\\"steel fists\\\\\" of the economy - State-owned corporations, at least to review the business performance of 30 SOEs. In the assigning of next year\\'s tasks for these units, it should not be in the direction of exploiting how many tonnes of oil or coal, but how much profit and how much the profit rate is, which means focusing more on quality.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, the proposal to increase the value added tax (VAT) at this time is also stirring social concerns. This issue should be thoroughly considered and calculated to choose the most appropriate option.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding the VAT increase, Tran Quoc Phuong said that the MPI, when reporting the issue to the Government, mentioned that the VAT increase in the time ahead should be thoroughly researched and include an impact assessment for State budget collection, as well as impact on the consumption of the entire population, especially those with low income, on production costs of enterprises, and on labour and employment.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam Railways proposes over VND4.6 trillion investment in modernisation\\\\n\\\\nVietnam Railways (VNR) has proposed an investment of over VND4.6 trillion (US$202.4 million) in order to buy new locomotives and carriages by 2020, with 70% of the total amount to be borrowed from the State-owned Vietnam Development Bank.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the document sent to the Ministry of Transport, VNR intends to gradually replace technologically backward locomotives, coaches, and waggons with modern ones by 2020 in a bid to reduce costs, improve efficiency and increase the competitiveness of rail transportation.\\\\n\\\\nSpecifically, VNR will buy 100 new locomotives worth over VND2.1 trillion, 150 passenger coaches worth over VND1.6 trillion, 300 container waggons worth VND270 billion, and 500 waggons, with speeds below 60km per hour, worth VND550 billion.\\\\n\\\\nApproximately 70% of the total investment (VND3.2 trillion) is proposed to be borrowed from Vietnam Development Bank, while 30% of the investment will be counterpart funded from the VNR, Hanoi Railway and Saigon Railway.\\\\n\\\\nVNR said that it wants to receive the loan from the State-owned Vietnam Development Bank, as the interest rate for investment projects is stable and the borrowing period is lengthy, while enterprises can use assets formed from loans as collateral assets. Meanwhile, loans from commercial banks will bear higher rates in addition to a shorter borrowing period, resulting in low business efficiency, VNR noted.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, it is difficult for VNR to gain access to loans from the Vietnam Development Bank as VNR\\'s projects are not subject to loans from the bank.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the amended Railways Law 2017, the VNR will be provided with preferential credit from the State\\'s investment credit or provided with loans guaranteed by the Government. But, the Railways Law 2017 will not begin to come into force until July 1, 2018.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, VNR has asked the Ministry of Transport to report to the Government for approval of the loans from the Vietnam Development Bank in order to timely meet the investment requirements in infrastructure development.\\\\n\\\\nVNR pledged to fully comply with the loan procedures and to perform the obligation to pay principal and interest in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.\\\\n\\\\nRailway industry needs $205 million to renew locomotives, coaches\\\\n\\\\nVietnam Railways has proposed the Ministry of Transport to permit it to get loans from Vietnam Development Bank (VDB) to buy new locomotives and coaches with the total investment capital of VND4,658 billion (US$205 million).\\\\n\\\\nThe corporation is expected to buy 100 new locomotives, 150 passenger coaches, 300 container coaches and 500 coaches having the speed of less than 60 kilometers an hour to gradually replace old and downgraded coaches from now until 2020.\\\\n\\\\nOf the total funds, nearly VND1,398 billion accounting for 30 percent will be reciprocal capital from Vietnam Railways, Saigon and Hanoi Railway Transport Companies. The remaining amount accounting for 70 percent will be bank loans.\\\\n\\\\nThe investment aims at raising the competitive ability of railway compared to other types of transport.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam Railways says that the project is not subject to borrowers of VDB.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Articles 5 and 6 of the revised Railway Law 2017, the corporation can get preferential credit source of the state or receive Government\\'s loan guarantee for the project. However, the law will take effect on July 1, 2018.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, Vietnam Railways has proposed the Ministry of Transport to report to the Government, permitting the railway industry\\'s investment projects to get loans from VDB so that they will be invested in a timely manner.\\\\n\\\\nMassimo Dutti opens first store in Vietnam\\\\n\\\\nMassimo Dutti last Friday opened its first store on the first floor of Vincom Center on Dong Khoi Street in District 1, HCMC.\\\\n\\\\nMassimo Dutti was present for the first time in the fashion industry in 1985. In 1991, it was acquired by the Inditex Group. In 2003, Massimo Dutti launched a children\\'s fashion line under the name Boys and Girls.\\\\n\\\\nCurrently, the brand boasts more than 775 stores in 73 countries around the world.\\\\n\\\\nHCMC wants to lure more Chinese tourists\\\\n\\\\nTravel companies in HCMC want to woo more Chinese tourists in the coming time to help boost international arrivals to the city and revenue from tourism.\\\\n\\\\nAt a seminar on solutions to attract Chinese tourists to HCMC held by the municipal Department of Tourism last week, Phan Xuan Anh, chairman of Viet Excursions, said the city holds high potential to attract Chinese tourists, but it should focus on high-spending visitors.\\\\n\\\\nHCMC is not as popular as Nha Trang, Hanoi, Halong Bay and Danang among Chinese tourists. Last year, Vietnam welcomed more than 2.69 million Chinese visitors, surging 51.4% versus 2015, but only 400,000 of them came to HCMC, increasing 37.4% year-on-year.\\\\n\\\\nTourists from the neighboring country are keen on sea travel. Services in Can Gio or Vung Tau can satisfy these requirements.\\\\n\\\\nAt the seminar, some Chinese experts also provide information about tourist sources, and their hobbies and ways to get tourism information.\\\\n\\\\nThe city should seek guests from Beijing, Shanghai, Fujian and Guangdong, and other eastern coastal provinces of China who have high demand for overseas travel.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism, Chinese tourists to Vietnam can increase by 1.3 million to four million this year. At present, a huge number of Chinese travel to Nha Trang, Danang and Phu Quoc on chartered flights.\\\\n\\\\nAir service between Cam Ranh and Seoul to be launched\\\\n\\\\nRepresentatives of Nha Trang-Khanh Hoa Tourism Association and South Korea\\'s Jeju Air struck a deal last week to launch a tourism air service connecting Cam Ranh Peninsula in the south-central coast province of Khanh Hoa and the Korean capital Seoul.\\\\n\\\\nThe service will be launched late this year, with a flight frequency of one trip a day. Each trip will take around five hours.\\\\n\\\\nThe association will work with local tour operators and hotels to develop services and manpower to serve Korean tourists, as well as to create favorable conditions for Vietnamese to visit the Northeast Asian nation.\\\\n\\\\nEarlier, the association has carried out a survey of the South Korean market, and found out that it has great potential for growth. This is why it teams up with the Korean partner to prop up tourism. The move is to diversify source markets for Khanh Hoa\\'s tourism sector, in addition to China and Russia.\\\\n\\\\nOn Thursday, the province launched a direct air service to Malaysia. Therefore, some companies are preparing travel programs, including tours to Dalat City of Lam Dong Province, to serve Malaysian tourists.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We are in preparation for the first group of Malaysia tourists to Khanh Hoa, thanks to the direct air service. The tourists will enjoy four days in Dalat and Nha Trang,\\\\\" said Giang Loi Khon from Hong Thai Travel Co Ltd on the sidelines of the signing ceremony.\\\\n\\\\nCement makers warn city of costs if production is halted\\\\n\\\\nHCMC can suffer extra costs of VND1.4 trillion (US$62.15 million) if it invests in cement distribution facilities to replace cement grinding plants which will be shut down to prevent pollution, said a representative of Ha Tien 1 Cement JSC.\\\\n\\\\nAt a discussion on the development of building materials in HCMC to 2020 with a vision towards 2030, the municipal Department of Construction said the city would not invest in new cement plants, including clinker factories and grinding stations.\\\\n\\\\nThe city plans to relocate those cement grinding stations meeting environmental standards to industrial parks in the city or other localities. Ba Ta Co JSC, for example, will shut down from next year, while Saigon Development Corporation and Ha Tien 1 Cement JSC will be relocated later.\\\\n\\\\nThe scheme is not only meant to limit environmental pollution but also to ensure enterprises\\' operations.\\\\n\\\\nHCMC is now home to ten cement grinding and distribution stations with a total annual capacity of more than 10 million tons, which still falls short of the city\\'s demand. By 2020, the city may lack 3.3 million tons a year to satisfy its demand.\\\\n\\\\nHCMC plans to initially build three distribution stations with a capacity of 1.2 million tons each to replace its grinding stations and cement factories. Thus, total cement supplies in the city will amount to 13.7 million tons in 2020.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, cement makers said such a plan will cost the city dearly in terms of economic value.\\\\n\\\\nA representative of Ha Tien 1 Cement JSC said transshipment and loading fees will be huge as the city will require ships to transport cement from northern ports. Total estimated investment may reach US$600 million, equivalent to the investment in 11 cement grinding stations with an annual capacity of 1.2 million.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, the city will have to build special-use ports to receive bulk cement shipments from the north as all ports have no facilities for bulk cement handling, except for Cat Lai Port in District 2.\\\\n\\\\nHigher prices spur retail revenue\\\\n\\\\nRetail revenue from consumer goods in the first seven months of the year increased substantially over the same period last year, but this rise was attributed to higher prices, according to a report of market research firm Kantar Worldpanel.\\\\n\\\\nThe report on sales of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) was issued last Thursday after Kantar Worldpanel had conducted a 12-week market research in four large cities -- HCMC, Hanoi, Danang and Can Tho -- and in rural areas.\\\\n\\\\nRetail sales of consumer products grew 10% in January-July, 9.7% higher than in the year-earlier period. Revenues from FMCG sales in both rural and urban areas picked up 5.3% year-on-year.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the revenue growth did not come from the higher consumer spending. Instead, in some rural areas in the central and northern regions, consumption tended to decrease, especially of dairy products.\\\\n\\\\nHigher prices of products were also reflected in the average consumer price index (CPI) in the first seven months which edged up 3.91% over the year-ago period. The rate was only 1.82% in January-July last year compared to the same period in 2015.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Kantar Worldpanel, the CPI of below 4% may not be kept in the remaining months of the year as food prices inched up in July after going down for six consecutive months and fuel prices have also been revised up.\\\\n\\\\nMavin pledges to inject US$80 million into Nghe An\\\\n\\\\nMavin Group has pledged to pour around US$80 million into the north-central province of Nghe An, mainly in the husbandry sector, said the group\\'s chairman David John Whitehead at an investment conference in HCMC last Friday.\\\\n\\\\nWhitehead told the conference \\\\\"Nghe An: opportunities for your business growth\\\\\" that Mavin has been doing business in Vietnam for more than 12 years, and has set up shop in 19 provinces nationwide.\\\\n\\\\nThe group inaugurated a feed mill in February at a total cost of US$15 million. The facility covers 3.6 hectares and has a designed capacity of 300,000 tons a year.\\\\n\\\\nMavin has recently been awarded a business certificate to develop a swine nucleus farm worth US$18 million, which is part of the firm\\'s US$80 million investment commitment to Nghe An.\\\\n\\\\nMavin also intends to establish an animal health research center, and carry out a feasibility study for a five-hectare food processing plant which may get off the ground next year. The facility which has an annual capacity of 200,000 tons costs around US$25 million. It will turn out products from meat, such as sausages and ham, for customers at home and abroad.\\\\n\\\\nWhitehead said Mavin has taken into consideration many factors like manpower, market, geography, investment incentives, and transparency before making its investment decisions. The company is committed to Nghe An as the local government has extended a lot of support to it, said Whitehead.\\\\n\\\\nMany domestic and international investors have come to sound out business opportunities in Nghe An, according to Nguyen Chi Toan, marketing director of the Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Park (VSIP) for central and southern Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\nSince VSIP Nghe An, an industrial park infrastructure development company, started construction in September 2015, more than 90 companies from various countries and territories have come to the province, of which 10 enterprises have pledged over VND400 billion, Toan said.\\\\n\\\\nAdvance payment for metro project in HCMC yet to be disbursed\\\\n\\\\nAlthough the Government has allowed HCMC authorities to use capital from the medium-term public investment plan for the 2016-2020 period to make advance payments for the Metro Line No.1 project to speed up construction work but the money has not been disbursed, threatening the progress of the project.\\\\n\\\\nLe Nguyen Minh Quang, head of the HCMC Management Authority for Urban Railways (MAUR), told a meeting on Saturday that the construction of Metro Line No.1, which connects Ben Thanh Market in District 1 and Suoi Tien Park in District 9, is at risk of falling behind schedule due to slower-than-expected disbursement of official development assistance (ODA) loans from the central Government.\\\\n\\\\nSome contractors said they would have to suspend construction work if the city delays payments, so the city has to use its own budget to advance money for the contractors.\\\\n\\\\nOn August 25, HCMC chairman Nguyen Thanh Phong signed a decision advancing VND500 billion (about US$22 million) from the city\\'s budget to pay for the contractors of the project.\\\\n\\\\nAs of early September, the contractors had received nearly VND300 billion. However, this is just a temporary solution.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The city has to pay the metro project\\'s contractors VND500-600 billion a month. If slow disbursement of ODA loans continues, the construction pace of the project would be badly affected,\\\\\" Quang said.\\\\n\\\\nThe city\\'s government earlier made an advance payment of nearly VND1 trillion for the contractors.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to MAUR\\'s report, Package 1a for the underground section from Ben Thanh station to Opera House station is 13.5% complete while Package 1b for the underground section from Ba Son station to Opera House station is 51% done.\\\\n\\\\nPackage 2 for the elevated section from Ba Son to Long Binh is 69.5% finished while locomotives, cars and rails for Package 3 are now being manufactured in Japan. The contractor has plans to import the first train to Vietnam next August.\\\\n\\\\nDuong Huu Hoa, director of Metro Line No.1 project, said the contractors will begin to install the rails for the metro line\\'s elevated section in October 15. Up to 8,000 rails for the track are now manufactured in Long An Province and will be transported to HCMC soon.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, import of machines and equipment that facilitate rail installation is now facing difficulties. Quang said the Ministry of Finance earlier announced that such machines and equipment will enjoy 0% import tax. However, the ministry has issued a new circular saying that those goods might be taxed.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Quang, another reason for the slower-than-expected construction of the city\\'s first metro line project is complicated procedures and paperwork on the part of ministries.\\\\n\\\\nMetro Line No.1 is nearly 20 kilometers long, passing through districts 1, 2, 9, Binh Thanh, Thu Duc in HCMC and part of Di An District in neighboring Binh Duong Province. It has 2.6 kilometers of underground track and over 17 kilometers of elevated track along Hanoi Highway.\\\\n\\\\nThe US$2.49 billion project is scheduled for operation in late 2020.\\\\n\\\\nTuna exports to emerging markets on the rise\\\\n\\\\nTuna exports rose by 22% to US$328 million in the first seven months against the same period last year, according to latest statistics from the General Department of Vietnam Customs.\\\\n\\\\nExports of most tuna products enjoy growth, particularly canned tuna saw the highest growth rate of 32.3%, trailed by fresh, frozen and dried tuna products (up 14%).\\\\n\\\\nTuna products have been exported to more than 70 countries in the world. The US, EU, Israel, ASEAN, Japan, Mexico, Canada and China were major importers of Vietnam tuna products in seven months, accounting for 88% of its total export value.\\\\n\\\\nMost export markets obtained growth in July. For instance, tuna exports to the US inched up 8% to US$20 million while exports to the EU increased by 23% to US$69 million against the same period last year. It\\'s noteworthy that exports to Italy rose sharply in July after seeing constant decline since early this year. Exports to the market in the period skyrocketed 166% to US$1.2 million.\\\\n\\\\nIsrael surpassed ASEAN and Japan to become the third largest consumer of Vietnam tuna in the first 7 months with US$28 million, up 155%.\\\\n\\\\nIn recent times, as tuna consumption demands in traditional markets like the US, EU and Japan seem to come to a grinding halt, Vietnam tuna exporters shift to emerging markets in the Middle East, especially Israel.\\\\n\\\\nThe Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers forecast that tuna exports to the US and EU will increase slowly late this year while exports to new markets will witness strong rise.\\\\n\\\\nFrench firms learn about investment chances in Da Nang\\'s hi-tech park\\\\n\\\\nRepresentatives from about 30 French enterprises participated in a seminar introducing investment opportunities in the hi-tech park in the central city of Da Nang held by the French Business Federation (MEDEF) in Paris on September 11.\\\\n\\\\nThe event was part of the Da Nang Hi-Tech Park (DHTP) Management Board\\'s investment promotion activities in Europe.\\\\n\\\\nAt the seminar, Director General of the board Phung Tan Viet informed the participants of the park\\'s construction process and development plans.\\\\n\\\\nParticipating businesses were also briefed on Da Nang\\'s preferential policies and projects which need investment in the DHTP.\\\\n\\\\nWith a total area of more than 1,100ha, the DHTP is one of Vietnam\\'s three hi-tech parks, connecting industrial and economic zones in the key economic region in central Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\nThe park welcomes enterprises to visit and invest in its projects, Viet added.\\\\n\\\\nMichel Jonqueres, President of the MEDEF\\'s International Commission, said that Da Nang and the DHTP\\'s clear administrative procedures are an advantage that encourages investment.\\\\n\\\\nHe also expressed optimism about the two sides\\' cooperation opportunities, especially with Da Nang hosting the APEC Leaders\\' Week 2017 in November and drawing leaders of 21 APEC economies and thousands of official delegates and heads of the world\\'s leading enterprises.\\\\n\\\\nAt present, the DHTP has more than 300ha of land available for investment projects. In the first half of 2017, it attracted seven projects worth 158 million USD.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam accelerates fruit, veggie imports from Thailand\\\\n\\\\nVietnam\\'s fruit and vegetable imports from Thailand in the first seven months of 2017 picked up 3.2 times compared to the same period last year, shows Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development data.\\\\n\\\\nIn explaining the sudden upsurge, Hoang Trung, head of the Plant Protection Department under the ministry, said Vietnamese firms bought fruits and vegetables from Thailand to ship them on to China.\\\\n\\\\nThailand remains Vietnam\\'s largest exporter of fruits and vegetables and accounts for 61.8% of the country\\'s total fruit and vegetable purchases from abroad, followed by China with 16%.\\\\n\\\\nBesides Thailand, India and New Zealand were also major fruit and vegetable exporters to Vietnam, with respective growth of 2.2 times and 53.5% in January-July.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to a report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Vietnam spent US$169 million buying fruits and vegetables in August, taking the total in the first eight months to US$1.02 billion, a year-on-year surge of 94%.\\\\n\\\\nVegetable imports doubled to US$190 million and fruit imports grew 34.6% to US$809 million year-on-year.\\\\n\\\\nIn the other way around, Vietnam has secured Thailand\\'s approval to annually export 9,000-10,000 tons of fruits and vegetables to the neighboring country, especially dragon fruit, Trung noted.\\\\n\\\\nThe ministry report also said Vietnam exported US$296 million worth of fruits and vegetables last month, taking the total in January-August to US$2.32 billion, up 46.5% versus the year-ago period.\\\\n\\\\nChina, Japan, the U.S., and South Korea were the four leading importers of Vietnamese fruits and vegetables in January-July, representing 85.1% of the country\\'s total exports.\\\\n\\\\nIn the first seven months of the year, the country\\'s major export markets include Japan with 61.7% growth, the United Arab Emirates with 61.4%, China with 61.3%, Russia with 49.4%, the U.S. with 26.7%, Taiwan with 19.2% and the Netherlands with 12.9%.\\\\n\\\\nIndustry ministry still struggling with 12 loss-making projects\\\\n\\\\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade is still grappling difficulties in dealing with the 12 loss-making investment projects though there are bright prospects for some of them.\\\\n\\\\nThe ministry told Deputy Prime Minister Vuong Dinh Hue, head of the steering committee for handling the 12 projects, at a meeting in Hanoi on September 6 that Viet Trung steel mill and DAP 1 fertilizer plant in Haiphong City had begun to be profitable, reports the Government news website. For the ethanol projects in Quang Ngai and Phu Tho provinces, some investors have shown interest in them.\\\\n\\\\nA report delivered at the meeting by the ministry said four fertilizer projects of the Vietnam Chemicals Group have resumed production but one of them, DAP 2 in Lao Cai Province, has stopped operation for maintenance since August 12.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, all of them but DAP 1 in Haiphong City have yet to be financially efficient as input costs have remained higher than expected.\\\\n\\\\nFor five projects under the Vietnam Oil and Gas Group (PVN), the Dung Quat ethanol plant in Quang Ngai Province has not been able to return to production due to the lack of funding for solving problems with its wastewater treatment facility.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, shareholders have been discouraged by the lower-than-expected fuel prices which might lead to losses for them. Ethanol is mixed with A92 gasoline to make E5 bio-gasoline, a fuel which is cheaper than A92 and A95 petrol but has yet to win consumer confidence due to concerns over quality.\\\\n\\\\nThe ministry said at the meeting that several investors have expressed interest in getting involved in this ethanol project and that shareholders have been told to work with investors over the possibility of clinching a business cooperation contract to bring the facility back to life.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, PVN has told its subsidiary PVOil to draw up plans to divest from an ethanol plant in Phu Tho Province and another in Binh Phuoc Province. The ministry\\'s report said there has appeared an investor interested in the Phu Tho facility.\\\\n\\\\nPVTex, a polyester fiber factory in the northern city of Haiphong, has remained in distress as it has been financially unable to carry out a court decision to pay out more than VND73 billion in water and power bills for the authority of the Dinh Vu Industrial Park where PVTex is located. Meanwhile, the Government is determined to not inject new capital into PVTex.\\\\n\\\\nFor Dung Quat Shipyard, PVN has asked its affiliates to use services at the shipyard to help keep it afloat and secure jobs for workers there. But there is a high possibility that the shipyard could be disbanded.\\\\n\\\\nIn two steel projects under the Vietnam Steel Corporation, the ministry said, after the Government took back a VND1 trillion budget for the second phase of Thai Nguyen steel plant, Chinese contractor MCC has returned to the negotiating table to solve the lingering problems with this project.\\\\n\\\\nThe other steel project, Viet Trung steel mill, has reported profit since March this year, with first-half profit estimated at VND67 billion and full-year tax payments projected at VND290 billion.\\\\n\\\\nDeputy PM Vuong Dinh Hue told the State Bank of Vietnam to work with commercial banks over plans to restructure debts owed by the 12 projects. These plans would be used as a basis for the Ministry of Finance to weigh rescheduling the depreciation and amortization process of the 12 projects.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, the owners of these projects must find ways to cut costs and implement restructuring plans so that they could get out of the woods, Hue noted.\\\\n\\\\nProperty market seen undergoing drastic change\\\\n\\\\nThe HCMC Real Estate Association (HoREA) has forecast there will be a drastic shift in the property market in the 2016-2020 period with demand for small and medium houses for low-income people to surge and supply of high-end apartments to outstrip demand.\\\\n\\\\nThe real estate market in HCMC and Vietnam as a whole was opened up in 1987 and officially took shape in 1993 when the National Assembly passed the first law on land use and an ordinance on homeownership.\\\\n\\\\nThe market development depends on five factors, namely the law of value, competition, supply and demand, government policies and mechanisms, and investment and business activities of enterprises.\\\\n\\\\nThe property market expanded significantly in 1993, 2001, 2002 and the second half of 2010. But it became frozen from 1995 to 1999, from early 2008 to mid-2009 and in the 2011-2013 period but then recovered robustly in the 2003-2006 period, and from 2009 to mid-2010. Since 2013, the market has remained buoyant.\\\\n\\\\nThe real estate market in HCMC registered positive growth in the 2006-2015 period despite woes.\\\\n\\\\nSince 2016 the market has shown signs of slowing down, especially in the high-end housing and tourism property segments. However, the market fundamentals have stayed solid given strong demand.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam holds strong e-commerce growth potential - report\\\\n\\\\nE-commerce in Vietnam has much room for growth but local companies have yet to tap its potential, according to a market research report.\\\\n\\\\nThe next source of growth is Connected Spenders, who have the ability to access the Internet and are willing to spend their discretionary income, according to the report by Nielsen Vietnam and the Demand Institute.\\\\n\\\\nThe report predicts these consumers will account for nearly 40% of the global population, thereby contributing more than 50% to annual spending.\\\\n\\\\nThanks to growing access to the digital economy and all that comes with it, the East Asia and Pacific region will witness the greatest increase in the number of Connected Spenders, especially in emerging markets like Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\nThe report says there were 23 million Connected Spenders in Vietnam in 2015 and the figure is expected to nearly double to 40 million by 2025. Their spending will rise from US$50 billion annually to US$99 billion over the same time period and by 2025, they are expected to account for half of the total consumer spending.\\\\n\\\\nAround one-third of Vietnamese Connected Spenders are between 21 and 34 years old (34%). By definition, the report says, over three-quarters of the consumers within the higher income bracket are Connected Spenders (76%) and nearly two-thirds of those have middle income, and 43% falls into the lower income group.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Vietnamese Connected Spenders will spend US$0.8 trillion over the next decade. Therefore, for consumer-facing businesses seeking to grow in Vietnam, these are the consumers whose needs will need to be addressed,\\\\\" said Rakesh Dayal, executive director of Consumer Insights at Nielsen Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\nThe report stresses Connected Spenders are much more adept at omnichannel shopping. Around 80% of them think shopping online is more fun and convenient. Before buying, regardless of searching online or offline, they gather information from both sources.\\\\n\\\\nAround four in five read online reviews (83%) and refer to social media comments (74%) prior to purchasing a product whereas two out of three (66%) check out products in the physical store before purchasing them online.\\\\n\\\\nEspecially, Connected Spenders are price-conscious, constantly on the lookout for special deals and promotions: more than half of them use price saving apps to search for the best deals even when they plan a shopping trip online or in store.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, Nielsen Vietnam urges local firms to pay attention to Connected Spenders as a new emerging type of consumer.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam has great potential for e-commerce as more than half of the population has access to the Internet, and 44.3% of households own smartphones or mobile devices. Notably, online consumers rocketed 129% in 2011-2015, according to a survey of Vietnamese consumers conducted by Singapore-based market technology company Criteo.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, data of market research firm Kantar Worldpanel Vietnam shows e-commerce, despite exponential growth, accounted for a mere 0.4% of the domestic retail market last year. Of this tiny market share, 43% of goods were sold by traders on Facebook while the remainder were consumed through e-commerce websites.\\\\n\\\\nKantar Worldpanel forecasts e-commerce will amount to 2.2% and online buyers will make up 25% of the total by 2025.\",\"url\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/english.vietnamnet.vn\\\\/fms\\\\/business\\\\/186262\\\\/business-in-brief-12-9.html\"},\"15\":{\"source\":\"PBS NewsHour\",\"text\":\"HARI SREENIVASAN, PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND: After the Miami-Fort Lauder metropolitan area, Tampa St. Petersburg is Florida\\'s most populous area, with 2.5 million residents.\\\\n\\\\nThe Tampa area, lying on the state\\'s western, Gulf of Mexico coast, has not sustained a direct hit from a hurricane since 1921.\\\\n\\\\nBut today, in Tampa and throughout central Florida, storm preparations were in full swing, as Newshour Weekend\\'s P.J.

The mayor says construction standards have improved since Florida\\'s most destructive storm, 1992\\'s Hurricane Andrew.\\\\n\\\\nBUCKHORN: People want to live on the water. It\\'s why they come to Florida. Building codes have increased significantly since Hurricane Andrew. The construction process now is much better than it used to be.

The investors now intend to equip the industrial complex with a second liquid jetty and a general cargo port. They hope to work together with local Quang Ninh authorities to connect the new industrial zone with a deep seaport.\\\\n\\\\nThe signing marked a milestone in co-operation ties between the two parties.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"This will be a great opportunity to show the Seaport of Azov\\'s commitment to investing in Viet Nam. The ultimate aim of this strategic cooperation framework is to draw Russian companies to invest and expand business in Viet Nam in general, and in northern regions such as Quang Ninh in particular,\\\\\" said Andrian Sinebok, a chairman of board, Seaport of Azov, speaking at the signing ceremony.\\\\n\\\\nThe strategic location of the complex, between deep waters and shallow river, will allow all tenants of the complex to distribute their products via inland waterway, which will reduce the number of trucks on the roads.\\\\n\\\\nRent A Port and Seaport of Azov\\'s MoU comes at a time when Russian investment in Viet Nam has slowed down. Statistics show that by the end of August, Russian businesses had registered to invest around US$1.026 billion in 114 valid projects in Viet Nam.\\\\n\\\\nThe MoU is also a positive response to the partnership agreement signed between Viet Nam\\'s President Tran Dai Quang and Russia\\'s President Vladimir Putin in the end of June, under which they have agreed to invest around $10 billion in both countries.\\\\n\\\\nThe Viet Nam-Russia Industrial Complex signals a new wave of Russian investments into Viet Nam.\\\\n\\\\nThe project would be logical continuation between Deep C consortium and Seaport of Azov in the Euro Jetty JSC, whose first investment was the successful liquid jetty in Dinh Vu Industrial Zone, which has 20 members, including America\\'s Chevron and several Japanese clients.\\\\n\\\\nThe inking of the MOU represents the strong relationship of more than 20 years between Rent A Port and Seaport of Azov.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam attends Top Resa tourism fair in France\\\\n\\\\nVietnam will attend the International French Travel Market Top Resa on September 26-29, reports Vietnam Investment Review.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT) will introduce international friends to the country\\'s land, hospitable people and tourism destinations.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam will also present the National Tourism Year 2018 - Ha Long, Quang Ninh, and special tourism products to promote Vietnam image as an attractive destination in ASEAN.\\\\n\\\\nWithin the framework of the event, VNAT will coordinate with the Vietnam Embassy, the Vietnam Culture Centre and Vietnam Airlines to organize a fair to advertise Hanoi tourism to French travel agents and press and communications agencies.

Agriculture 4.0 refers to farming practices that make use of digital technology to increase sustainability and productivity.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to machinery displays, the exhibition offers seminars to support the education of farmers. The event is expected to attract 15 per cent more visitors than the previous year and to generate more than one billion baht.\\\\n\\\\nThe event has drawn more than 300 exhibitors from many countries, including China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey and Viet Nam.\\\\n\\\\nSIMA\\'s exhibitors are showcasing a comprehensive range of products and services, such as tractors; spare parts and accessories; embedded electronics; tilling, sowing, planting, harvesting and post-harvest equipment; equipment for tropical and special crops; livestock handling, transportation, storage and breeding equipment; renewable energy; consultancy; management and software.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony, Dr Suwit Chaikiattiyos, director general of the Department of Agriculture under the Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives, said, \\\\\"We hope that this event will be a platform to exchange ideas and the latest technology, leading to rapid industrial development, an increase of leverage in negotiations for farmers, and a higher capability of Thai agribusiness in the highly competitive international market.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nJean-Hugues, Key Account Manager at SIMA - SITEVI, told Viet Nam News that they are working to attract international companies to bring new materials and technologies that could be applied in the Southeast Asian region and Thailand.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"SIMA can help farmers to develop their production and to increase efficiency of production by proposing new technology that will help them to have more sustainable agriculture,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"It\\'s important that we introduce materials, machinery and equipment adapted to size of the crop, because the size of the crop in the Southeast Asian region is of course smaller than ones in Western Europe.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe Vietnamese delegation this year includes 30 business members of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Viet Nam.\\\\n\\\\nAlexander Nguyen, CEO of Alex\\'s Organic Nutrition Food for Animals, believes this event will be a good opportunity to introduce Vietnamese organic food for animals to international customers.

Research institutes will study high-quality breeds and supply them for breeding centers and farmers.\\\\n\\\\nThe plan can help produce disease-resistant tra fish breeds as a mere 10-15% of the current breeds can be kept alive.\\\\n\\\\nThe project will be implemented in two phases, with one lasting from 2018 to 2020 and the other from 2021 to 2025. It will go before the Government in October and come into force from next year, Tung added.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to the breeding center in An Giang Province, the breeding centers in Dong Thap Province and Can Tho City should be upgraded in the 2018-2020 period, according to participants at the meeting.\\\\n\\\\nVIFEP has proposed numerous projects and programs using either State or private capital to help solve difficulties in tra fish breed production.\\\\n\\\\nLe Hoang Vu, director of the Dong Thap Province Fisheries Bureau, said tra fish breeds supplied by the Research Institute for Aquaculture No. 2 grow well but their disease resistance remains weak.\\\\n\\\\nHuynh Van Mung from Mung Liem Company, a tra fish breed producer with 200 branches in the Mekong Delta, said it is necessary to have a standard and effective breed production process in place.\\\\n\\\\nIn 1998, Vietnam exported some 200 tons of tra fish to the U.S and the number soared to 20,000 tons in 2002. At present, annual tra fish shipments to the U.S. amount to US$1.8 billion, accounting for about 25% of the country\\'s total tra fish exports.\\\\n\\\\nOther major markets for tra fish are China, the European Union (EU) and ASEAN. Vietnam also ships tra fish to more than 100 other countries and territories.\\\\n\\\\nFinance Ministry wants business registration fee lowered\\\\n\\\\nThe Ministry of Finance has proposed halving the fee for new business registrations, and business registration certificate adjustments to VND100,000.\\\\n\\\\nThe ministry is drafting a circular amending Circular 215\\\\/2016\\\\/TT-BTC on collection, payment, management and use of fees for provision of business-related information, and for business registrations.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to the proposed fee reduction, the ministry suggests the charge for providing company information be lowered from VND5 million to VND4.5 million for 125 documents or above per month.\\\\n\\\\nThe ministry cites Resolution 75\\\\/NQ-CP adopted on August 9, 2017 at the Government\\'s regular meeting as saying that the ministry was assigned to work with ministries, agencies and local governments to agree on a fee reduction for businesses.\\\\n\\\\nThis is why the ministry is reviewing this circular and asking for feedback from the public on its official website before it is presented at the Government\\'s regular meeting next month.\\\\n\\\\nThe ministry has also proposed the Ministry of Planning and Investment calculate the fee revenue decline as a result of releasing the revised circular.\\\\n\\\\nThe January-August period saw around 85,350 startups registered with total capital of over VND822.1 trillion (around US$36.2 billion), up 16.3% and 44.8% respectively over the same period last year, according to the Business Registration Agency.\\\\n\\\\nMore entities to buy compulsory fire and explosion insurance\\\\n\\\\nThe Finance Ministry has asked the Government to expand the compulsory fire and explosion insurance coverage.\\\\n\\\\nIn a draft Government decree, the ministry suggests 19 groups of entities be obliged to purchase fire and explosion insurance.\\\\n\\\\nThe list is included in the Government\\'s Decree 79\\\\/2014\\\\/ND-CP dated July 31, 2014 guiding the execution of the Law on Fire Prevention and Fighting.\\\\n\\\\nCompared with the current list prescribed in the Government\\'s Decree 130\\\\/2006\\\\/ND-CP issued in 2006 to regulate compulsory fire and explosion insurance, more establishments would be forced to buy fire and explosion insurance.\\\\n\\\\nGroup one consists of institutes, universities, colleges, intermediate schools, vocational schools, high schools, other large educational institutions, and kindergartens with 100 kids or above.\\\\n\\\\nGroup two includes television and radio stations, and post and telecom agencies at district level or above. Group three has plants whose functions are to build and repair vessels, or fix and maintain planes.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, the proposed decree would still apply to those prescribed in the current one but their scale would be smaller. For instance, hospitals and other healthcare facilities with 21 beds or over, down from the current 50, would be subject to the new decree.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to a clear explanation of rights and responsibilities between the insurer and the insured, the draft decree specifies how to calculate insurance premiums, and solve disputes if the two sides cannot decide the value of goods.\\\\n\\\\nEspecially, insurers would contribute a mere 1% of their revenues, instead of the current 5%, to the fire prevention and fighting fund if the draft decree is approved.\\\\n\\\\nSouth Korea introduces industrial tourism to Vietnamese\\\\n\\\\nThe Korea Tourism Organization has introduced industrial tourism to a group of 26 Vietnamese in a bid to lure more tourists to South Korea.\\\\n\\\\nThe Vietnamese often choose to visit Seoul, Busan and Juju Island for leisure travel. Local tour operators should offer new forms of tourism service including industrial tourism so that their customers can have more choices.\\\\n\\\\nIn industrial tourism services, guests are taken to desired destinations such as particular industrial sites.\\\\n\\\\nSouth Korea is promoting this kind of tourism as it expects to capitalize on its thriving industrial and cultural destinations. Therefore, it has sponsored tours for foreign media and tourism companies to get hands-on experience in industrial tourism.\\\\n\\\\nA group of 26 Vietnamese journalists and tour operators was invited to visit Korea from August 28 to September 1. The tour took in heritage sites, places where specialties are made, and industrial plants.\\\\n\\\\nPhan Dinh Hue, general director of Viet Circle Travel and Service Company, said Vietnamese tour operators often bring their guests to Korea\\'s popular destinations like Everland, the largest theme park of the Northeast Asian country.\\\\n\\\\nKorea will organize two seminars on industrial tourism in Hanoi and HCMC on September 19 and 21 respectively.\\\\n\\\\nHCMC loan growth put at 10.92%\\\\n\\\\nTotal outstanding loans in HCMC had amounted to VND1,630 trillion (US$71.7 billion) by early this month, up 19.8% versus the year-ago period and 10.92% against December last year, according to the HCMC Statistics Office.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Lao dong newspaper, commercial joint-stock banks lent a total of VND887.3 trillion, accounting for 54.28% of the total in the city\\'s banking system and increasing 16.62% year-on-year. Thus, the State Bank of Vietnam\\'s credit promotion policy paid off.\\\\n\\\\nForeign-currency loans totaled VND154.2 trillion equivalent, up 15.47% against the same period last year and making up 9.44% of the total. Meanwhile, loans in Vietnamese dong grew 20.27% to VND1,480 trillion, 90.56% of the total.\\\\n\\\\nThe amount of capital mobilized by banks in the city had reached VND1,890 trillion by early this month, growing 0.76% over last month and 12.61% year-on-year. Of which, foreign and local currency capital made up 12.01% and 87.99% respectively, 6.28% and 13.53% higher than in the year-ago period.\\\\n\\\\nCommercial joint-stock banks made up 52.79% of the total capital raised, up 8.75 points year-on-year.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to a State Bank of Vietnam report, commercial banks applied an annual interest rate of 6-6.5% to short-term loans and 9-10% to medium and long-term loans for customers in priority fields.\\\\n\\\\nFor normal loans, the respective interest rates were 6.8-9% for short terms and 9.3-11% for medium and long terms while clients with a high level of creditworthiness were subject to 4-5% for short-term loans.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, banks charged an annual interest rate of 2.8-4.7% on short-term loans in U.S. dollar and 4.7-6% on medium and long-term ones.\\\\n\\\\nTien Giang wants to build overpass to industrial park\\\\n\\\\nThe Mekong Delta province of Tien Giang has proposed the Ministry of Transport develop an overpass to the Tan Huong Industrial Park on National Highway 1 to reduce traffic congestion there.\\\\n\\\\nTran Van Bon, director of the provincial Transport Department, told the Daily on September 4 that the ministry had greenlit the project as a component of the National Highway 1 bypass project in Cai Lay town in phase two.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, Bon said, the ministry later withdrew its decision, saying the overpass could not be treated as part of the bypass project. But the provincial government has still insisted the ministry consider funding the overpass project with an estimated cost of about VND300 billion (US$13.2 million), he added.\\\\n\\\\nHe said the ministry is still finding financing for the project, so the fate of the project remains undecided.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Tien Giang Province has 12 bridges which need to be widened, but the Transport Ministry has done four bridges while six others have yet to secure sufficient capital. Therefore, it would be tough to searching for funding for the overpass.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe province, meanwhile, cannot allocate its public investment capital for the project until 2020, according to the director.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, the province encourages workers to use small roads around the industrial park instead of National Highway 1 to reduce traffic jams there in the short run.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We are working with the provincial labor federation and the management of the industrial park to rearrange traffic around the industrial park,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nThe Tan Huong Industrial Park has 50,000-60,000 workers crossing National Highway 1 from the park\\'s main entrance, thus leading to heavy traffic congestion at rush hour.\\\\n\\\\nNew manufacturing orders rise faster in August\\\\n\\\\nThe recent modest improvements in the Vietnamese manufacturing sector continued in August, with slightly faster increases seen in output and new orders.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to a recent report by Nikkei, central to the latest improvement in business conditions was the solid and accelerated rise in new orders. New business has increased continuously since December 2015, with stronger client demand mentioned by respondents.\\\\n\\\\nThe rate of expansion in new export orders also quickened and was the fastest in four months. Rising new orders led to another increase in manufacturing production, the tenth in as many months.\\\\n\\\\nThe headline Nikkei Vietnam Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\\' Index (PMI) ticked up to 51.8 in August from 51.7 in July, extending the current sequence of strengthening business conditions to 21 months.\\\\n\\\\nHigher output requirements encouraged firms to take on extra staff. The rate of job creation was only marginal, and the slowest in the current 17-month sequence of rising employment.\\\\n\\\\nStaff shortages and rising new orders were reportedly factors leading to a second successive monthly rise in backlogs of work. Although easing from July\\'s 75-month high, the rate of accumulation was still one of the sharpest in the series history.\\\\n\\\\nRaw material shortages were a feature of the latest survey, contributing both to higher input costs and longer suppliers\\' delivery times. The rate of input price inflation quickened to a four-month high, and was sharp.\\\\n\\\\nAndrew Harker, associate director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said the Vietnamese manufacturing sector continued to perform steadily mid-way through the third quarter of the year.\\\\n\\\\nThere were further positive signs regarding new orders which should help the sector maintain growth going forward. The weakness of the latest increase in employment is disappointing. Job creation will hopefully pick up in coming months given further reports of pressure on capacity.\\\\n\\\\nBesides, raw material shortages were a feature of the latest survey, meanwhile, causing a marked acceleration of cost inflation and delivery delays from suppliers.\\\\n\\\\nPurchasing activity increased at a faster pace, with the latest expansion linked to higher new orders. Stocks of purchases also rose, the 14th month running in which this has been the case.\\\\n\\\\nPost-production inventories, on the other hand, decreased for the second successive month, albeit marginally. Panelists suggested that the dispatch of finished products to customers had been behind the reduction.\\\\n\\\\nBusiness confidence improved in August and was the strongest since March. Anecdotal evidence suggested that firms were planning to increase output, helped by expansions in capacity and predictions of rising new orders. More than 56% of respondents predicted a rise in production over the coming 12 months.\\\\n\\\\nNew Hospital 115 to be built in PPP format\\\\n\\\\nThe government of HCMC has given the nod to Van Thinh Phat Investment Joint Stock Company to map out a plan to build a new Hospital 115 in the public-private partnership (PPP) format to replace the existing Hospital 115 which has deteriorated.\\\\n\\\\nHospital 115 has 1,600 beds and nearly 1,700 staff. The public hospital often faces overload as it serves 4,000-6,000 patients a day.\\\\n\\\\nIn late 2016, the Ministry of Health suggested the hospital seek the municipal government\\'s approval to build a new facility to improve services and meet Joint Commission International (JCI) standards.\\\\n\\\\nThe city has allowed Hospital 115 to team up with Hoa Lam Investment Development Corporation to provide well-trained health workers for Hoa Lam International Hospital to receive patients from Hospital 115.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, the city has approved Mekong Tourism Service Corporation\\'s project to build Saigon International General Hospital with 90 beds at 124 Tran Quoc Thao Street, District 3. This VND1-trillion hospital will get off the ground in late 2017 and get ready by 2020.\\\\n\\\\nThe city has approved six other PPP hospital projects, including treatment zone 2 of Nguyen Tri Phuong Hospital, District 5 Hospital, Saigon General Hospital, District 7 Hospital, District 3 Hospital and Tan Phu District Hospital upgrade.\\\\n\\\\nAs of April 2017, the city had had 114 PPP projects with total capital estimated at VND131.7 trillion (over US$5.78 billion), of which healthcare projects accounted for over VND5 trillion.\\\\n\\\\nMooncake output and prices higher than last year\\\\n\\\\nTo prepare for this year\\'s Mid-Autumn Festival on the 15th of the eighth lunar month, which falls on October 4, local confectionary makers have launched mooncakes with output and prices higher than last year.\\\\n\\\\nPhan Van Thien, deputy general director of Bibica Joint Stock Company, said his firm will market 60 types of mooncake totaling 600 tons, a year-on-year rise of 10%. Due to rising input and manpower costs, Bibica mooncake prices will inch up 3% to VND37,000-150,000 a cake.\\\\n\\\\nNguyen Anh Trung, deputy general director of Givral Bakery Company, said Givral will launch 550 tons of mooncake, up 20% over last year, with prices picking up around 5% because of the same reasons as Bibica\\'s. The company has already made 190 tons available.\\\\n\\\\nNotably, Givral will bring its mooncakes to Laos and Cambodia for the first time. Trung said the company will sell 3,000-4,000 cakes with prices ranging from VND37,000 to VND150,000 each.\\\\n\\\\nA source from Brodard Bakery in HCMC told the Daily that the company will launch one million cakes totaling 250 tons on the market, with prices 5% higher than the same period last year.\\\\n\\\\nHuynh Cam Binh, marketing director of Dai Phat Group, said the company will turn out 500 tons of mooncake, up 35% year-on-year, on stronger demand. Its prices will also edge up 3% as employees are paid higher.\\\\n\\\\nA source from Mondelez Kinh Do said the company will ship some kinds of mooncake to China and the United States.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, Mondelez will introduce 84 types of mooncake with many new flavors to suit different customer tastes. They will be sold at VND40,000-VND3.2 million each.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to famous mooncake brands, homemade products have been selling well. For instance, Phan Thuy Trang, who advertises her mooncakes on her Facebook page, told the Daily that she has sold around 200 cakes of different kinds and has secured orders to provide 250 cakes. She looks to sell a total of 1,500-2,000 cakes with prices ranging from VND80,000 to VND125,000 each.\\\\n\\\\nBesides local mooncakes, customers have begun paying special attention to Hong Kong and Malaysian products. Each box of eight cakes costs VND1 million to VND2 million.\\\\n\\\\nLow global demand drives down rice price\\\\n\\\\nLow global demand has sent the rice price in Vietnam declining as the summer-fall rice crop has ended, said rice traders.\\\\n\\\\nThe free-on-board (FOB) export price of 5% broken rice fell slightly from US$385-395 to US$385-390 a ton last week.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to a Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development report on farm exports, Vietnam exported 3.96 million tons of rice worth US$1.75 billion in the first eight months of 2017, up 20% in volume and 17.5% in value year-on-year. However, the average rice export price decreased 2% to US$440 a ton in January-July.\\\\n\\\\nChina remained the largest rice buyer which accounted for 40% of Vietnam\\'s total export volume.\\\\n\\\\nThe same situation was also seen in other leading rice exporting countries in Asia such as Thailand and India.\\\\n\\\\nThailand sold 5% broken rice at US$370-375 per ton last week compared to the US$375-377 range in the previous week. The price fell due to large supplies in the new crop.\\\\n\\\\nThai rice traders have forecast the price will continue falling next week but then stabilize until October.\\\\n\\\\nThe parboiled rice price in India, the largest rice exporter in the world, declined by US$3 to US$400-403 a ton as its currency grew stronger.\\\\n\\\\nRice traders in India said they could not reduce the price below US$400 a ton. Indian rice export may slow down in the coming months due to its uncompetitive prices.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh plans to purchase about 250,000 tons of white rice from Cambodia at US$453 a ton under a government-to-government (G2G) contract. Previously, Bangladesh has imported 200,000 tons of white rice at US$430 a ton and 50,000 tons of parboiled rice at US$470 a ton from Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\nBangladesh\\'s strong demand for rice has had an upward impact on global rice prices this year. The South Asian country has been trying to replenish its rice stocks to lower rice prices since the April flooding caused losses of a million ton of rice.\\\\n\\\\nMinistry says will relax rice export regulations\\\\n\\\\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade is seeking to abolish many regulations on rice export activities to make rice trade easier for exporters. At the same time, the ministry will narrow down the exclusive right of the Vietnam Food Association (VFA).\\\\n\\\\nThe ministry has completed collecting opinions of relevant agencies about a draft Government decree which will replace Decree 109\\\\/2010\\\\/ND-CP of the Government on rice export business.\\\\n\\\\nAccordingly, most barriers in the rice trade will be removed, especially those excluding small traders from the competitionThese include quantitative restrictions such as a regulation that a rice trader must have at least a warehouse able to store at least 5,000 tons of rice, and at least a rice mill with a capacity of at least 10 tons of rice an hour. The warehouses and milling facilities must be located in provinces or cities from which rice is exported.\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, some enterprises exporting a small volume of high-quality organic rice cannot meet the above-mentioned conditions, such as Co May Pri\\\\n\\\\nvate Enterprise in Dong Thap Province and Vien Phu Trade and Production JSC in Ca Mau Province.The ministry will also eliminate the requirement for locations of warehouses and mills as it creates difficulties for localities and traders in rice export and shows the administrative intervention in an enterprise\\'s decision-making process.\\\\n\\\\nThe regulation on rice storage will also be relaxed. According to Decree 109, rice exporters must store a volume of rice equivalent to at least 10% of their total exports in the previous six months. The Ministry of Industry and Trade proposed decreasing the proportion to 5% as the rule causes overstocking and higher costs.\\\\n\\\\nEnterprises also found procedures for registration of rice export contracts complicated. Shortcomings of the VFA during the registration of export contracts make enterprises anxious about their business information being leaked, so the regulation on rice export contract registration with the VFA should be scrapped.\\\\n\\\\nThe rule on the floor export price of rice will likely be removed as well because rice prices change unpredictably.\\\\n\\\\nThe draft decree does not stipulate the sizes of a warehouse and rice husking mill provided that they meet technical standards issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. In addition, traders will not be forced to have rice husking facilities.\\\\n\\\\nThe ministry has also amended and supplemented several regulations to facilitate rice export activities such as the abolition of procedures for inspecting traders in meeting business conditions. Instead, traders will provide information and take responsibility for their claim of meeting business conditions.\\\\n\\\\nThe role of VFA will also be narrowed down. According to the current decree, only VFA has the right to decide on rice export under government-to-government (G2G) contracts and distribute benefits to its member enterprises. The regulation may create unfair advantages for other export companies.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, the ministry has limited the managerial responsibilities of VFA so that the association can distribute 80% of G2G contracts in line with regulations stated in the decree.\\\\n\\\\nThe ministry said new regulations on rice export activities will make life easier for traders and reduce market entry costs so that traders can improve their business competitiveness and product quality to boost consumption.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam currently has 140 rice exporting firms. In 2016, the country shipped rice to 150 countries and territories.\\\\n\\\\nCan Tho eyes expanded ties with Australia in hi-tech agriculture\\\\n\\\\nThe Mekong Delta City of Can Tho hopes to expand cooperation with overseas partners, including those from Australia, to improve production capacity as the city sets out to be a regional pioneer in hi-tech agriculture.\\\\n\\\\nThe statement was made by Vice Chairman of the municipal People\\'s Committee Truong Quang Hoai Nam in a meeting with Rob Gordon, CEO of food producer and exporter Sunrice from Australia, on September 7 where they discussed ways to boost the city\\'s rice production and exports.\\\\n\\\\nCan Tho lies in the heart of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam\\'s largest rice basket, and exports more than half a million tonnes of rice worth 300 million USD on average annually, said Nam. The region\\'s rice exports were estimated at more than 400,000 tonnes in the first eight months of 2017, an increase of 3.9 percent from the same period last year, earning 190.8 million USD, up 10.1 percent, he noted.\\\\n\\\\nThe city aims to lead the region in hi-tech agriculture to reduce cost and enhance productivity and quality of farm produce, he said, adding that it looks forward to fostering ties with foreign companies, particularly from Australia, to access new agricultural technologies and more markets in Europe, North America and North Asia.\\\\n\\\\nFor his part, Gordon said Vietnam is capable of gaining a larger market share in these markets thanks to its competitively priced rice compared to rivals in the region, with Vietnamese rice selling for 300-400 USD per tonne less than Thailand\\'s.\\\\n\\\\nHe suggested that the firm will assist Can Tho in developing supply chains in rice farming. He also noted that the firm is interested in some local hi-tech agricultural projects.\\\\n\\\\nWelcoming the proposal, Nam vowed to work with local state agencies to support Sunrice.\\\\n\\\\nCoal prices: Power generator, coal company reach agreement\\\\n\\\\nThe Electricity of Vi\\\\u1ec7t Nam (EVN) and its coal supplier Vi\\\\u1ec7t Nam National Coal and Mineral Industries Group (Vinacomin) have finally reached an agreement on coal selling prices for power production.\\\\n\\\\nThe agreed price, which has not yet been disclosed, has come into effect from September 1, according to the Ministry of Finance.\\\\n\\\\nEarlier, the relationship between EVN, the country\\'s largest power generator, and Vinacomin, a long-time coal supplier of EVN, became tense when EVN revealed its plan to reduce coal purchased from Vinacomin, the country\\'s largest coal miner, explaining that the group wanted to buy products at reasonable prices which fitted its power generation technology.\\\\n\\\\nEVN was then seeking the Government\\'s permission to move forward with the plan, according to which it looked to reduce its coal purchase to 17.92 million metric tonnes, a two-million-tonne drop from its previous plan.\\\\n\\\\nVinacomin immediately expressed its opposition to EVN\\'s proposal, claiming it would make Vinacomin\\'s coal production costs increase and reduce effectiveness.\\\\n\\\\nBesides this, the corporation would have to lay off 4,000 workers to make up for the financial losses if EVN went through with its plan to cut coal purchase.\\\\n\\\\nVinacomin requested intervention by the Government and relevant ministries to convince EVN to avoid purchasing coal from other units this year to avoid losses for Vinacomin.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, claiming unfairness in taxes and fees, Vinacomin said the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) should have policies to encourage use of locally produced coal and limit imported coal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Under no circumstance should EVN stop buying coal from Vinacomin to purchase coal from foreign suppliers\\\\\", a representative of EVN said.\\\\n\\\\nIt was the high coal prices that had forced EVN to cut coal bought from Vinacomin. High coal prices would make electricity production cost increase and force the power sector to bear huge losses, he added. Therefore, instead of buying from Vinacomin, EVN would consider buying coal from other domestic companies at more reasonable prices, he added.\\\\n\\\\nAt a recent meeting, Minister and Chairman of the Government Office Mai Ti\\\\u1ebfn D\\\\u0169ng requested that the MoIT and related agencies urgently implement solutions to consume Vinacomin\\'s coal inventory.\\\\n\\\\nD\\\\u0169ng said Vinacomin should also take measures to lower cost and increase competitiveness. For example, imported coal dust is priced at just VN\\\\u01101.4 million to 1.6 million (US$61-70) per tonne, while the price of coal produced by Vinacomin is VN\\\\u0110500,000 higher per tonne, he said.\\\\n\\\\nFord announces annual sustainability report\\\\n\\\\nUS auto manufacturer Ford Motor Company, has released its 18th annual sustainability report, including a short film, that details environmental progress at its operations around the world and a commitment to further enhance sustainability actions in the future.\\\\n\\\\nThe company said the pace of economic development in Asia over the past 25 or more years has been remarkable, creating exciting new opportunities for hundreds of millions of people, but decades of manufacturing-led growth has also come at a price, with environmental challenges now confronting the region.\\\\n\\\\nNow as governments, communities and individuals rise to meet this new challenge, the company\\'s new report details how Ford is leveraging key learning from its leading environmental practices around the world to its operations in Asia Pacific.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"One of the key reasons for this is that they benefit from all that we\\'ve learned over our more than 100 years of Ford manufacturing history,\\\\\" said Andy Hobbs, global director of Ford\\'s Environmental Quality Office. \\\\\"Many of our plants in Asia Pacific are less than a decade old, so this has allowed us to apply everything we know about sustainability from other operations around the world.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"When our plants were built in Asia Pacific, we dictated the specifications to ensure we protect natural resources,\\\\\" he added.\\\\n\\\\nSince 2000, Ford has published its sustainability report to track the company\\'s comprehensive approach to managing issues related to climate change, air quality and conservation, as well as to identify opportunities that can have a significant impact across the business, from water stewardship to supplier training and education.\\\\n\\\\nThe 2016-17 Ford Sustainability Report highlights key environmental performance indicators in Asia Pacific, including: slashing water consumption by 50 per cent, achieving zero waste to landfill, driving innovation across the business, working with the supply chain, and being a responsible business.\\\\n\\\\nSong Da Corp to divest from hydroelectricity companies\\\\n\\\\nConstruction giant Song Da Corporation announced recently that it would be selling its stakes in several hydroelectricity companies in October.\\\\n\\\\nSong Da, which holds a stake of 0.92 per cent in Ho Bon Hydroelectricity Joint Stock Company, plans to sell its 216,000 shares at an initial price of VND10,400 (US$0.45) per share. The auction will be held on October 3 at the Ha Noi Stock Exchange. Ho Bon has a charter capital of VND235.4 billion.\\\\n\\\\nOn the same day, Song Da will also put on auction its entire 558,000 shares, or 1.3 per cent stake, in Nam Muc Hydroelectricity at an initial price of VND10,300 per share.\\\\n\\\\nFounded in 2007, Nam Muc was connected to the national grid in 2015, and its revenue has jumped from VND98 billion in 2015 to VND155.5 billion in 2017. However, the company reported a loss of VND5.4 billion in 2016 and is forecast to incur a loss of VND4.25 billion this year.\\\\n\\\\nPreviously, Song Da was planning to sell 16.27 million shares of Huong Son Hydroelectricity, but the divestment process has not been completed.\\\\n\\\\nThe corporation is also divesting from the Southern Power Investment and Development Joint Stock Company (SEB). Currently, it owns 1.21 million SEB shares, or 6.06 per cent of the company\\'s charter capital.\\\\n\\\\nIn July, the Prime Minister approved the equitisation plan for Song Da Corporation, allowing it to sell parts of State-owned capital and issue shares to increase its charter capital to VND4.5 trillion.\\\\n\\\\nAccordingly, Song Da will launch its initial public offering (IPO) of 450 million shares at VND10,000 per share, with the state retaining 229.5 million shares, or 51 per cent of the charter capital, until the end of 2019. The State capital will be reduced to below 50 per cent of the charter capital in 2020.\\\\n\\\\nSBV provides guidance on vehicles used as bank collateral\\\\n\\\\nThe State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) has officially guided credit institutions on granting a legal confirmation in written document for vehicles used as bank collateral.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Document 7000\\\\/NHNN-PC, credit institutions and branches of foreign banks receiving the collateral of vehicles, or mortgagees, will have to grant a mortgage receipt for borrowers, or mortgagors.\\\\n\\\\nIn cases where the mortgagors violate the obligation to pay debts secured by vehicles, mortgagees and mortgagors will have to reach an agreement.\\\\n\\\\nThe validity term of the mortgage receipt must be agreed to by mortgagees and mortgagors, but must not be beyond the effective term of the mortgage contract.\\\\n\\\\nThe renewal issuance of a mortgage receipt is made in two cases, when the mortgage receipt is damaged, or when information on the mortgage receipt needs to be changed.\\\\n\\\\nCredit institutions must co-operate with the traffic police in information exchange when required.\\\\n\\\\nThe move was made after the SBV received multiple complaints from credit institutions and companies recently, stating that the traffic police refused to accept copies of vehicle registration certificates in place of the originals, which had been submitted to secure loans.\\\\n\\\\nFurther confusion arose when a bank-issued confirmation of the vehicle\\'s use as collateral was also not accepted by the traffic police.\\\\n\\\\nThe situation has inconvenienced creditors, banks and other credit institutions, as not holding the original documents of collateral ownership increases risks to them, which may lead to them ceasing to accept automobiles as collateral.\\\\n\\\\nThis would make it harder for citizens and businesses to get loans, while at the same time not allowing credit institutions to hold either the collateral or its certificate of ownership incurs significant risk.\\\\n\\\\nTo deal with this, on August 15 this year, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh issued a decision, allowing drivers to use a certified copy of vehicle registration certificate and the original mortgage receipt granted by credit institution, in lieu of the original of the vehicle registration certificate for movement on the Vietnamese territory during the time the credit institutions hold the original.\\\\n\\\\nThe Deputy PM also entrusted the SBV to grant the above mortgage receipt.\\\\n\\\\nVietjet offers 700,000 discounted tickets at ITE HCMC\\\\n\\\\nVietjet is giving away 700,000 promotional tickets at the 13th International Travel Expo HCM City (ITE HCMC), which is taking place at the Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre.\\\\n\\\\nThe airfares, available from noon to 2pm until Saturday, have prices starting at zero \\\\u0111\\\\u1ed3ng.

The average revenue of a cooperative is approximately VND3 billion (US$132,000) per year.\\\\n\\\\nJapanese investors eye Can Tho\\\\n\\\\nCan Tho wants to partner with the Japan National Tourism Organisation to promote its tourism potential and attract more international tourists, an official from the Cuu Long (Mekong) delta city said.\\\\n\\\\nAt a meeting with officials from JNTO\\'s Viet Nam office on Tuesday, Truong Quang Hoai Nam, deputy chairman of the city People\\'s Committee, said the city still faces some challenges in promoting tourism, which it considers a key sector.\\\\n\\\\nAs a result, though Can Tho is a socio-economic hub of the delta and known for its diverse tourism products, its tourism sector has not yet fulfilled its potential.\\\\n\\\\nLast year Can Tho received more than 5.3 million foreign tourists but only a third chose to stay overnight.\\\\n\\\\nThis year more than 5.4 million have visited Can Tho with only 1.35 million staying on.\\\\n\\\\nNam blamed this on a \\\\\"shortage of international flight routes, international-standard attractions and big investors who are capable of investing in high-quality tourism projects.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nTo give a boost to the tourism sector, the city needs to form partnerships with cultural-tourism organisations in the region, he said.\\\\n\\\\nNam said the city is soliciting investment in the many hillocks along the Hau River, including Son Hillock in Cai Rang District where some investors are building resorts and a golf course.\\\\n\\\\nSon Hillock in Binh Thuy District has seen community-based tourism grow rather slowly, and the city has encouraged investment in diversifying tourism products and building resorts.\\\\n\\\\nTakahashi Ayumi, JNTO\\'s chief representative in Viet Nam, said Japan is deeply interested in tourism activities in Can Tho since the city possesses beautiful landscapes created by rivers and orchards, something that can hardly be seen in Japan.\\\\n\\\\nAdmitting his organisation does not know much about Can Tho tourism, he said city authorities should provide more information so that it could disseminate it among Japanese tourist agencies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Last year more than 740,000 Japanese tourists visited Viet Nam. And the main destinations were Ha Noi, HCM City and Da Nang. This year we have started promoting tourism to a new destination, which is Can Tho. Hopefully, the number of Japanese tourists to Can Tho and vice versa will increase.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nTakahashi pledged to lobby the Japanese embassy for easing visa policies for Vietnamese tourists and hold more exchange events to boost tourism co-operation between the two countries.\\\\n\\\\nHe urged the Can Tho authorities to start more air services from the delta to major Japanese cities to facilitate travel.\\\\n\\\\nTrung Son hydropower plant begins production\\\\n\\\\nToshiba Corporation announced that all the hydropower turbines and generators of units 1 to 4 at the Trung Son Hydro Power Station, manufactured by Toshiba Hydro Power (Hangzhou) Company Ltd, have started commercial operation.\\\\n\\\\nThe 260MW plant was financed by the World Bank through its first ever loan to Vi\\\\u1ec7t Nam, and combines drought and flood control with electricity supply.\\\\n\\\\nTakao Konishi, vice president of the thermal & hydro power systems & services division at Toshiba Corporation\\'s Energy Systems & Solutions Company said: \\\\\"Toshiba has over 120 years\\' experience in delivering high-quality hydropower systems for projects around the world. We are also very pleased to support Viet Nam in meeting its fast rising energy demand, and will continue to provide support as the Vietnamese economy continues to grow.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIn Viet Nam, hydropower accounts for half the total installed capacity of 34GW.\\\\n\\\\nThe Government is responding to growing demand with an expansion plan that will raise capacity to 75GW in 2020 and 146.8GW by 2030.\\\\n\\\\nSeminar mulls ways to develop HCMC firms\\\\n\\\\nImproving the investment and business environment and administrative reforms are among the measures needed to facilitate the development of businesses in HCM City, a seminar heard on Wednesday.\\\\n\\\\nTran Thi Binh Minh, deputy director of the city Department of Planning and Investment, said as of May 25 the city had 309,138 businesses, 89.25 per cent of them very small, 4.3 per cent small, 5 per cent medium-sized and 1.37 per cent large.\\\\n\\\\nIn response to the Government\\'s target of having one million businesses in the country by 2020, city authorities last year issued resolution 3907\\\\/QD-UBND to help expand the number in the city to 500,000, many of them large, she said.\\\\n\\\\nThe city has drafted specific measures to create favourable conditions for businesses, including simplifying administrative procedures, setting up hotlines to receive feedback from companies and help them resolve their difficulties in a timely manner and developing programmes to provide information about support policies, she said.\\\\n\\\\nThe city has also issued decisions to promote start-ups, especially by youths and students, and help household businesses develop into companies, she said.\\\\n\\\\nNguyen Dinh Tue, director of the Centre for Supporting Small and Medium sized Enterprises, said while administrative procedures have been streamlined somewhat, they are still slow and do not meet businesses\\' expectations.\\\\n\\\\nHe called for continued reform and changing the approach towards it, otherwise \\\\\"it will be hard to change the situation,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nBusinesses face difficulties, including the need to obtain a slew of sub-licences, inspections by multiple agencies, and problems related to funding, land, human resources, demand, and others, he said.\\\\n\\\\nThe number of businesses not functioning is very large at around 41 per cent, he said.\\\\n\\\\nThe city needs to hold discussions with businesses to resolve their difficulties, he said.\\\\n\\\\nTo encourage household businesses to become companies, the city needs to offer free support with incorporation and other procedures, he said.\\\\n\\\\nSeveral delegates said new businesses should be offered legal, accounting and tax consultancy at subsidised rates.\\\\n\\\\nDistrict leaders said relevant agencies should have clear instructions on helping household businesses expand into companies.\\\\n\\\\nNguyen Van Dung, head of the city People Council\\'s economic and budget board, said comprehensive measures are needed from the Government and local agencies to create a level playing field for businesses.\\\\n\\\\nBesides, businesses themselves need to be more active in grasping opportunities and capitalising on their resources and the Government\\'s support policies to develop, he said.\\\\n\\\\nMany delegates said it is also necessary to focus on quality rather than solely on quantity.\\\\n\\\\nThey also called for building strong national trademarks to enhance competitiveness in the regional and global markets.\\\\n\\\\nThua Thien-Hue targets 5,500 hectares of large-scale fields\\\\n\\\\nThe central province of Thua Thien-Hue plans to zone off an additional 5,500 hectares of large-scale fields to meet the target of cultivating 51,000-52,000 hectares of rice per year by 2020.\\\\n\\\\nLarge-scale field is a centralised production model bringing together farmers, businesses, scientists and State agencies to facilitate the application of technology in cultivation, thus improving the value of agricultural products and farmers\\' income.\\\\n\\\\nThe province is currently home to over 1,430 hectares of large-scale fields, increasing economic efficiency from 15 to 20 percent.\\\\n\\\\nClose connections between local farmers and businesses have brought remarkable achievements to the model. Farmers gathered to create huge volume of farm produce while businesses are responsible for providing seedlings at stable prices and providing the farmers with cultivation techniques to ensure the output and quality.\\\\n\\\\nUnder the large-scale field model, local authorities and residents join hands to build irrigational systems and promote mechanisation in agricultural production. Advanced technologies have been comprehensively applied, from cleaning up the fields before rice sowing, fertilising and preventing diseases to harvesting.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Director of the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Ho Sy Nguyen, the quality and quantity of farm produce are decisive factors for the success of large-scale field model.\\\\n\\\\nIn the coming time, all localities need to zone off suitable areas for large-scale fields, renovate production methods based on linkages among farmers, businesses and scientists as well as ensure stable consumption markets for farmers.\\\\n\\\\nBinh Dinh fishermen in bumper catch\\\\n\\\\nA fishing boat has caught more than 1.1 tonnes of tuna off Quy Nhon city in the central province of Binh Dinh.\\\\n\\\\nThe off-season catch was sold for 110,000 VND (4.84 USD) per kilogramme.\\\\n\\\\nTran Quang Bao, captain of the boat, said tuna prices had increased by around 12,000 VND (53 cents) per kilogramme since last month.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The price is quite high and so fishing boats and their crews have high incomes. We are quickly stocking up on food and water to return to the sea.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, so far this year the fishermen have caught 8,511 tonnes of tuna, up 18.6 percent compared to the same period last year.\\\\n\\\\nOn average, a boat earns 70-80 million VND (3,077-3,517 USD) per trip.\\\\n\\\\nNguyen Viet Nghia, deputy director of the Institute for Seafood Research, said 485,600-502,900 tonnes of tuna are caught off central provinces every year.\\\\n\\\\nThe boats are mainly from Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa and Binh Dinh, and their catches comprise yellow fin tuna, big eye tuna and skipjack tuna, he said.\\\\n\\\\nBinh Dinh was the first province to use new technologies and skills to supply fish to Japan, especially tuna.\\\\n\\\\nBy 2014 the province\\'s fishermen had modern equipment and technologies worth 1 million USD to catch, preserve and transport tuna.\\\\n\\\\nIn September that year the first tuna was exported to Japan and sold at three times the price the fish fetches in the Vietnamese market.\\\\n\\\\nThe province has around 3,200 fishing boats.\\\\n\\\\nUS company hosts workshop to increase Vietnamese SMEs leadership\\\\n\\\\nThe US company Procter & Gamble hosted a workshop in Hanoi on September 6 to improve leadership of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\nThe event took place ahead of the 24th APEC Small and Medium Enterprises Ministerial Meeting (SMEMM) and related meetings, which are scheduled to take place in Ho Chi Minh City from September 10-15.\\\\n\\\\nP&G affirmed its long-term commitment in Vietnam through a partnership with the Ministry of Planning and Investment to help Vietnamese firms improve competitiveness and innovation.\\\\n\\\\nDeputy director of the ministry\\'s Enterprise Development Agency Nguyen Hoa Cuong said one of the top priorities of the Vietnamese Government from now to 2020 is developing SMEs as the engine of economic growth.\\\\n\\\\nImproving the capability of Vietnamese enterprises will bolster Vietnam\\'s integration and connectivity with other APEC economies, he said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Vietnam is one of P&G\\'s important markets\\\\\", Vice President and General Manager at P&G Asia-Pacific Omar Channawi said.\\\\n\\\\nHe went on to say that \\\\\"We are proud to continue our unwavering commitment to support and grow with local enterprises in a sustainable way\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Vietnam is among the first nations in Asia where P&G introduces both P&G SME Leadership College and Signal Accelerator,\\\\\" he added.\\\\n\\\\nHe hoped that these programmes will help Vietnamese SMEs increase their competitiveness, innovation and management capabilities, as well as grasp business opportunities.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam spends over US$1bn importing veg in Jan-Aug 2017\\\\n\\\\nWhile Vietnam sells its green produce around the world, the Southeast Asian country has also spent huge amounts of state money importing vegetables.\\\\n\\\\nIn the Jan-Aug period of this year, Vietnam imported more than US$1 billion worth of fruits and vegetables, a massive 94% increase on a year earlier, according to the agriculture ministry.\\\\n\\\\nThe eight-month import figures on vegetables were worth US$190 million, up 35% from the same period last year, while fruit imports more than doubled to top US$800 million, the ministry elaborated.\\\\n\\\\nIn August alone, the country spent nearly US$170 million on imported green produce.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam imports the most produce from Thailand, with the neighboring country\\'s produce accounting for nearly 62% of imports in the first eight months of 2017. China ranks second, making up 16% of Vietnam\\'s green import value.\\\\n\\\\nThe country\\'s fruit and vegetable imports from Thailand rose by 3.2 times from last year, while increases from the Indian and New Zealand markets were 2.2 times and 50%, according to the ministry.\\\\n\\\\nIt posted US$20.45 billion in export revenue from agro-forestry and aquatic products in the Jan-Jul period this year.\\\\n\\\\nAs of mid-July, Vietnam shipped more than US$1.8 billion worth of fruit and vegetable to other markets.\\\\n\\\\nAgricultural sector likely to achieve growth target this year\\\\n\\\\nDeputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Ha Cong Tuan told a ministry meeting in Hanoi on September 6 that the sector could achieve this year\\'s 3.5 percent growth target, set the Prime Minister.\\\\n\\\\nThe PM set agro-forestry-fisheries exports hitting 33 billion USD and 31 percent of communes meeting new rural development criteria.\\\\n\\\\nIn the first eight months this year, agro-forestry-fisheries exports rose 13.5 percent year-on-year to 23.7 billion USD, 5.1 billion USD of which was from the shipment of aquatic products, up 18.1 percent annually. Total aquatic exports this year are estimated to hit 8 billion USD, a billion USD more than 2016.\\\\n\\\\nNguyen Duy Vinh, deputy head of the ministry\\'s Planning Department, said the sector has focused on restructuring and choosing key products at national, regional and provincial levels while expanding export markets, popularising Vietnamese farm produce and improving food hygiene and safety.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the Cultivation Department, rice production nationwide is likely to increase by 250,000 - 300,000 tonnes annually to 44.1 million tonnes this year.\\\\n\\\\nTuan said the values of animal breeding, fisheries and forestry are expected to expand by 3 percent, 5 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively.\\\\n\\\\nOn new rural development, up to 2,813 communes met 19 criteria as of the late August, or 31.5 percent, surpassing the target. Meanwhile, 34 districts were recognised as new-style rural areas.

opportunities it will bring was discussed at the seventh Vietnam ICT Summit 2017, which concluded in Hanoi on September 6.\\\\n\\\\nTruong Gia Binh, Chairman of the Vietnam Software and IT Services Association, said Vietnam should take drastic actions to engage in the fourth industrial revolution.\\\\n\\\\nSpecifically, in information-technology, the country needs to create an environment that encourages innovation, and an open legal system facilitating new-style production and business models, he said.\\\\n\\\\nThe first job is to roll out a national strategy on digital transformation to plan digital socio-economic development, contributing to industrialisation, modernisation and economic reform, Binh noted.\\\\n\\\\nHe stressed that breakthroughs should be made on the basis of digital transformation in all sectors at all levels.\\\\n\\\\nExperts at the summit called for efforts from the entire political system, social organisations, businesses, universities, research institutes, scientists and society to enhance capacity to access the fourth industrial revolution.\\\\n\\\\nThe connectivity between State agencies, enterprises, universities and research institutes plays the core role in the work, they said.\\\\n\\\\nThey also pointed out the need for Vietnam to prioritise sectors that have potential in digital economic development, first of all the digital technological industry, smart agriculture and tourism.\\\\n\\\\nAt the same time, the Government and agencies relating to IT and communications should remove all barriers and build an ecosystem to promote innovation, start-ups and develop the private economic sector, making them drivers of the digital economy, they said.\\\\n\\\\nOther tasks include developing high-quality human resources and a standardised and open data base to create a foundation for the development of digital technology, they added.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam\\'s trade ministry asks gov\\'t to pay more for wind power\\\\n\\\\nVietnam\\'s Ministry of Industry and Trade has asked the government to raise the buying price for wind power in an effort to help investors cover high input costs.\\\\n\\\\nThe ministry suggested that the price should be lifted to 8.7 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for wind energy projects on land and 9.95 cents per kWh for offshore plants.\\\\n\\\\nSince 2011, the buying price for wind energy has stood at 7.8 cents for all land-based projects in Vietnam, with 6.8 cents paid by State-run power monopoly Vietnam Electricity (EVN), and the rest coming from the country\\'s Environment Protection Fund.\\\\n\\\\nFor the country\\'s only offshore plant in the southern province of Bac Lieu, the current price is 9.8 cents per kWh.\\\\n\\\\nThe trade ministry has calculated that this price adjustment would raise EVN\\'s production costs just slightly by VND0.08 per kWh this year and VND0.23 per kWh in 2019 (VND1= 0.004 cents).\\\\n\\\\nWith the current buying price at 7.8 cents per kWh, most wind power projects are experiencing difficulties, the ministry said.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, the buying price for wind power is 20 cents in Thailand, 29 cents in the Philippines and 30 cents in Japan.\\\\n\\\\nTran Vinh Thong, an official from Thuan Binh Wind Power Joint Stock Company that operates the Phu Lac wind power plant, said the first phase of the project had cost VND1.1 trillion, while the plant makes just VND100 billion in revenue each year.\\\\n\\\\nGiven interest payments at VND70-80 billion per year, Thuan Binh has just 20-30 billion to cover production costs and makes a small profit from running the project in the south-central province of Binh Thuan.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The biggest problem about investing in wind farms is the low buying prices and the time it takes to recover the investment,\\\\\" Thong said.\\\\n\\\\nAt the current rate, it will take the company 14 years to recoup its investment, while the life span of a wind farm is only 20 years, he added.\\\\n\\\\nThe total wind power capacity in Vietnam is predicted to reach 206MW this year, 456MW next year and 800MW in 2020.\\\\n\\\\nThe southern provinces of Ben Tre, Bac Lieu, Tra Vinh and Soc Trang have been eyed as potential destinations for the development of offshore wind farms.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam is trying to generate enough energy to sustain the country\\'s growth and to connect the millions of people who still do not have access power, while gradually shifting towards clean and low-carbon energy.\\\\n\\\\nLast year, the government revised down its output target for coal-fired power plants to 53.2% of the country\\'s total power generation by 2030 from the 56.4% previously projected.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam is aiming to produce 10.7 percent of its total electricity through renewable energy by 2030, mainly through solar and wind energy, up from 6 percent as previously planned.\\\\n\\\\nNguyen Anh Tuan, a senior energy official at the industry and trade ministry, told VnExpress in June that the government had raised the buying price for solar power from 7.8 cents to 9.35 cents per kWh, offered investors tax incentives and cut land use fees.\\\\n\\\\nHe said investors in wind power projects will likely have the same incentives in the near future.\\\\n\\\\nSpecial incentives in pipeline for agricultural investors\\\\n\\\\nIn a move to attract more private investment to the agriculture sector, Vietnam is mulling over offering a series of special incentives in terms of land-use fees and favourable loans for such projects.\\\\n\\\\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has held a seminar to collect comments for the latest version of a draft decree on incentives for the farming sector, which will replace Decree No.210\\\\/2013\\\\/ND-CP.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Decree 210 has proved problematic. There remain many problems in the agriculture sector due to reliance on small and retail households, thus having low productivity, market access difficulties, and low added value,\\\\\" admitted Nguyen Xuan Cuong, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The two key tasks will focus on agriculture restructuring towards increasing added value chains and dealing with the weaknesses of the sector, mainly processing and market access. We will also promote sci-tech applications amid the increasing global integration,\\\\\" he added.\\\\n\\\\nUnder this draft decree, a firm that has a project with special investment incentives will be exempt from land-use fees, while those having a project with investment incentives will enjoy a 70 per cent reduction in land-use fees.\\\\n\\\\nThis draft also includes financial support for agricultural businesses. Accordingly, a firm investing in an agriculture project with special investment incentives and investment incentives, and accepting land-use rights of households and individuals as capital contribution to develop a material area will get a financial support of VND50 million ($2,270) per hectare to develop infrastructure for the area.\\\\n\\\\nIn terms of credit policies, a business investing in an agriculture and rural development project will get local support for the interest rate for their commercial loans, once the project is completed.\\\\n\\\\nSpecifically, local support for interest rate payments will have a maximum term of eight years for agriculture projects with special investment incentives and six years for projects with investment incentives.\\\\n\\\\nThe borrowing cap with interest rate support is not higher than 70 per cent of the project\\'s total investment.\\\\n\\\\nThis draft also includes big support for startups in the sector. Accordingly, they will be exempted from water surface and land rental fees from the moment their projects are put into operation. Startups will also be exempt from import duty for machinery and equipment for their project.\\\\n\\\\nThere are also many other special financial supports for research, transfer, and application of high-technology in agriculture, for human resources training and market development, for investments in dairy cow and high-yielding cow projects, for investments in slaughter houses, for grown-forest processing projects, for investment in agro-forestry-fishery processing and preservation facilities, and for investments in agriculture and rural development infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nBoth local and foreign firms can benefit from the special incentives, according to the draft.\\\\n\\\\nMARD expects to submit the draft decree to the government for approval in September, contributing to making the sector more attractive to private investors.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the ministry, the number of businesses investing in agriculture remains modest. As of September 2016, the country had 4,424 businesses in the sector, making up less than 1 per cent of the country\\'s total.\\\\n\\\\nYoungone Corporation mulls investment in Soc Trang Province\\\\n\\\\nRepresentatives of Youngone Corporation, an ROK-based company principally engaged in the manufacture and distribution of outdoor sportswear and shoes, met with leaders of Soc Trang Province today, September 6.\\\\n\\\\nThe Company primarily operates its business through export of outdoor sportswear, shoes and backpacks to its buyers, which are manufactured by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in Bangladesh, China and Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\nThe purpose of the meeting was to discuss potential investment in a manufacturing facility in Soc Trang Province that if approved would create more than 10,000 good paying jobs.\\\\n\\\\nRegina Miracle project increases capital to US$500 million\\\\n\\\\nThe Regina Miracle International Vietnam Project has increased its investment capital to US$500 million from US$350 million.\\\\n\\\\nThe project, invested by Regina Miracle International of Hong Kong (China), received investment certification in 2014 with total registered capital of US$150 million at the Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Park based in the northern port city of Hai Phong.\\\\n\\\\nIt aims to produce 70 million bras, 15 million panties, three million pairs of shoes, and 15 million sports clothing.\\\\n\\\\nEngineer recalls bitter story of pioneering Vietnamese carmaker\\\\n\\\\nAs hope that Vietnam would finally produce cars domestically was renewed after construction of a new car factory began last week, one of the first local engineers who attempted to realize the dream has recalled how he failed as a pioneer.\\\\n\\\\nengineer recalls bitter story of pioneering vietnamese carmaker hinh 0 Now past his 70s, Bui Ngoc Huyen currently lives in his shutdown car factory in Me Linh, outside Hanoi.\\\\n\\\\nHuyen is the founder of Xuan Kien Auto, a company set up with the ambitious goal of producing locally made cars affordable for the Vietnamese.\\\\n\\\\nXuan Kien began its operation by manufacturing trucks branded Vinaxuki at two factories, one in Me Linh and the other in the north-central province of Thanh Hoa.\\\\n\\\\nDuring its heyday between 2009 and 2011, Vinaxuki trucks were ubiquitous across the country.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"There were times when dealers had to rent rooms near my factory, waiting to take the trucks as soon as they left the factory,\\\\\" Huyen recalled the good old days.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We delivered 50 to 60 units per day at that time.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nEncouraged by his success in the truck market, Huyen moved on to proving whether he could make Vinaxuki cars that cost only VND100 million (US$4,400) for local consumers.\\\\n\\\\nThe engineer and entrepreneur turned to Japanese experts to help with design and training tasks, and earmarked a VND250 billion (US$11 million) investment for the carmaking master plan.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, in 2012, the economy faltered, with bank loan interest rates skyrocketing to nearly 20% a year.\\\\n\\\\nBanks stopped lending money to Vinaxuki at affordable interest rates, forcing Huyen to sell off his own house and that of his son to repay his debts.\\\\n\\\\nThe challenges were so big that Huyen eventually had to shut down both of his Me Linh and Thanh Hoa factories, and made use of the abandoned land plots to grow vegetables.\\\\n\\\\nBut the made-in-Vietnam car pioneer has never given up.\\\\n\\\\nLate last year, Huyen submitted a 20-page petition to the government, seeking to have his debts extended so he could start restructuring the business.\\\\n\\\\nThe government accepted the petition and tasked the investment ministry with studying if it could help the man who dreams big.\\\\n\\\\nHuyen confirmed that he had never given up on the aspiration to improve Vietnam\\'s carmaking industry.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I will continue writing petitions to the government and the prime minister,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nHuyen said he can have his two factories resume operations as soon as his debts are allowed to be restructured.\\\\n\\\\nAcknowledging that finance is one of the reasons behind his failure, Huyen said Vingroup, the developer of the headline-grabbing Vinfast car factory in the northern city of Hai Phong last week, does not face this challenge.\\\\n\\\\nAs Vietnam\\'s leading property conglomerate, Vingroup has strong financial muscle, plus a committed US$800 million in credit from the Swiss Credit Suisse Group, which Huyen said are all big advantages for Vinfast.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Their deep pockets will allow Vinfast to acquire technology and invite experts to help them realize their dreams, and eventually they will be able to make cars,\\\\\" Huyen said.\\\\n\\\\nDong Nai firms seeks potential partners in Japan\\\\n\\\\nEnterprises from the southern province of Dong Nai and Japan were given a chance to meet and seek cooperation opportunities at a conference in Tokyo on September 7.\\\\n\\\\nThe event was jointly held by the Vietnamese Embassy in Japan and Dong Nai province People\\'s Committee with the aim of promoting export-import activities between the two countries.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking before representatives from 20 Vietnamese firms and over 50 Japanese enterprises, Vice Chairman of the provincial People\\'s Committee Tran Van Vinh highlighted the province\\'s advantages in terms of natural, economic and social conditions.\\\\n\\\\nHe stressed that Dong Nai, with stable and high economic growth at an average 13 percent per year, is one of the leading industrial localities in Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Vinh, the province accounted for 9-10 percent of the nation\\'s export revenues with key staples like garments, footwear, coffee, rubber, cashew and pepper.\\\\n\\\\nJapan is the second largest trade partner of Dong Nai, importing 1.58 billion USD worth of products from the province in 2016 while the province splashed out 1.3 billion USD buying Japanese goods the same year.\\\\n\\\\nThe official stressed that there is large room for Dong Nai to enhance trade relations with Japanese businesses, and the province commits to creating favourable conditions for enterprises for mutual benefits.\\\\n\\\\nMinister Counsellor of the Vietnamese Embassy in Japan Nguyen Truong Son

And when the security-service chief on one side of an armed conflict makes a public appeal to the security-service chief on the other side, even more so. In a televised interview this week, Ukrainian Security Service chief Vasyl Hrytsak appealed directly to Russian FSB head Aleksandr Bortnikov \\\\\"officer to officer.\\\\\" Hrytsak accused the Russian security services of organizing terrorist attacks in Odesa, Kharkiv, Kherson, and other Ukrainian cities. \\\\\"Even in war,\\\\\" Hrytsak said, \\\\\"there are rules that cannot be violated\\\\\" and \\\\\"you\\'ve crossed the red line.\\\\\" WATCH Today\\'s Daily Vertical Hrytsak concluded by asking Bortnikov: \\\\\"Do you realize that you will have to answer for these actions? Do you understand that today\\'s political leadership, including Putin, is not forever?\\\\\" Hrytsak\\'s appeal to Bortnikov raises an interesting question: Will Putin, Bortnikov, and others ever be asked to answer for Russia\\'s actions in Ukraine? Because it is beyond doubt that Russia illegally annexed Crimea. It is beyond doubt that Moscow has been complicit in the persecution of -- and in some cases the disappearance of -- Ukrainian citizens on the peninsula. Despite Moscow\\'s denials, the evidence is clear that Russia invaded the Donbas; and the overwhelming preponderance of evidence points to Russian culpability in the downing of Flight MH17. And yes, there is reasonable cause to suspect Russian involvement in those mysterious bombings, grenade attacks, and arsons that have occurred over the years in Odesa, Kharkiv, Kherson, and other Ukrainian cities. But despite all this, the Kremlin has gotten much of the world to buy into the fiction that it is a mediator in a war in which it is in fact the aggressor.\\\\n\\\\nRussia was ready to sacrifice its own people for war with Ukraine: report - Radio Poland :: News from Poland\\\\n\\\\nThe head of Ukraine\\'s security service said that Russia was prepared to blow up its own people in order to create grounds for invading Ukraine, according to reports by Ukraine\\'s public broadcaster Hromadske Radio.\\\\n\\\\nPutin\\'s threat: \\\\\"Other conflict zones\\\\\" may be attacked if U.S. gives lethal aid to Kyiv\\\\n\\\\nIf the United States provides lethal aid to Ukraine, Russian militants may point their guns at other Ukrainian regions beyond the war-torn Donbas,&nbsp;Russian President Vladimir Putin told a press conference following the BRICS summit in China&nbsp;an UNIAN&nbsp;correspondent in Russia reports.

The possible provision of the lethal arms to Ukraine by the US will not essentially change the situation in Donbas but can provoke the employment of the military force in other territories. The President of Russia Vladimir Putin claimed this at the press conference as Inforesist reported. \\'It is the sovereign decision of the US to choose for whom sell the arms or provide for free and the country that is the recipient of this aid. We cannot influence this process anyway. But there are the common international rules and approaches; the arms supply to the conflict zone will not be beneficial to the peacekeeping but it will only exacerbate the conflict\\', Putin said. According to him, \\'if it happens in this particular case then it will not essentially change the situation, it will influence the change of the situation in no way but the number of the victims can increase without doubt\\'. \\'There is one more point that should be considered- the person who cherishes such ideas\\'. \\'It lies in the fact that the self-proclaimed republics have enough arms, including the captured from the opposing force. If the American arms are supplied to the conflict zone that it is difficult to predict the reaction of the self-proclaimed republics; they can send the available arms to other zones of the conflict that are pressing for those who create the problems for them\\', Putin warned.\\\\n\\\\nPutin instructs Lavrov to introduce resolution on Donbas peacemakers to UN Security Council - Putin tells Lavrov to introduce resolution on Donbas peacekeepers to UN Security Council - 112.international\\\\n\\\\nPeacekeepers in Donbas are appropriate, but they should be on the demarcation line and not in any other territories, Russian president said. Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that the presence of UN peacekeepers in the Donbas would benefit the resolution of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, and instructed the Russian Foreign Ministry to introduce the draft resolution to the UN Security Council. Russian president said this during a press conference following the results of the BRICS summit, Interfax reports. \\\\\"The presence of peacekeepers, I can even say not the peacekeepers, but those people who ensure the security of the OSCE mission, I think is quite appropriate and I do not see anything wrong here. On the contrary, I believe that it would benefit the resolution of the problem in the southeast of Ukraine,\\\\\" Putin said. According to Putin, it can be \\\\\"only the function of ensuring the security of the OSCE staff.\\\\\" \\\\\"Secondly, in this connection these forces must be located on the line of demarcation and not on other territories. And the third point is that the resolution of this issue should happen only after the separation of parties to the conflict and removal of heavy equipment, which cannot be resolved without direct contact with representatives of self-proclaimed republics, \\\\\"DNR\\\\\" and \\\\\"LNR\\\\\",\\\\\" Putin said.\\\\n\\\\nPeacekeepers in Donbas quite appropriate, - Putin\\\\n\\\\n05.09.17 12:41 - President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin believes that deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in the Donbas is quite appropriate for solving of the conflict in the region, but only along the line of contact and with the aim of protecting the OSCE mission. Putin told a press conference following the BRICS summit in China that he agrees to the idea of deploying the U.N. peacekeepers in the Donbas only along the contact line to ensure safety of OSCE observers, and instructed the Russian Foreign Ministry to introduce a relevant resolution for consideration by the U.N. Security Council. He stressed that the issue of the peacekeepers\\' dispatch cannot be \\\\\"dragged\\\\\" through the U.N. General Assembly because the organization\\'s peacekeepers can be deployed only by decision of the Security Council. \\\\\"You say that someone wants to drag something through... In fact, I don\\'t see anything wrong here. I have repeatedly said that I support the idea of arming the OSCE mission, but the organization itself, the OSCE, refuses to arm its employees, since it has neither the relevant personnel nor the experience of such work,\\\\\" Putin said. According to him, the deployment of the U.N. peacekeepers or people who provide security for the OSCE mission is \\\\\"quite appropriate.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nKremlin scenarios will fail; peacekeepers must be introduced across all Russia-occupied territories, - Iryna Herashchenko on UN peacekeepers in Ukraine\\\\n\\\\n05.09.17 11:28 - U.N. peacekeepers must be introduced across all Russia-occupied territories of Ukraine. Ukraine\\'s representative in Humanitarian subgroup of the Tripartite contact group in Minsk talks, deputy speaker of Ukrainian parliament Iryna Herashchenko wrote on Facebook, Censor.NET reports. \\\\\"Putin, in keeping with the best traditions of hybrid war, is trying to distort the idea of the Ukrainian leadership on peacekeepers in the Donbas, to turn it upside down. He orders his loyal minister Lavrov to introduce a resolution in the U.N. Security Council on peacekeepers at the contact line. Wait a minute: the contact line became a contact line because of the Russian aggression. For us, it\\'s a contact line with territories temporarily occupied by Mordor which we will definitely have back. It\\'s a line that should disappear for good from the Ukrainian land on the day we regain control over the border. It\\'s not a Ukrainian border, so there could be no peacekeepers only along the contact line,\\\\\" Herashchenko wrote. She added that \\\\\"the Kremlin scenarios will fail.\\\\\" \\\\\"The peacekeepers should be introduced across all Russia-occupied territories to monitor security and demilitarization. And their mandate should end at the Ukraine-Russia border. It\\'s Izvaryne and other border crossing points, not Stanytsia Luhanska or Marinka, as the Kremlin chief desires,\\\\\" she said. Earlier, Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Mariya Zakharova said the initiative to have U.N. peacekeepers in the conflict area in the Donbas was an attempt to undermine the Minsk 2 process.

Moscow\\'s voting rights were suspended following the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. And in 2015, Vladimir Putin signed legislation allowing Russia to ignore rulings of the European Court of Human Rights. And now, as Nicholas Vinocur points out in a piece in Politico featured below, Russia may be forced out of the council altogether. Vinocur quotes Thorbjorn Jagland, secretary-general of the Council of Europe, as saying that \\\\\"there is a potential danger that Russia will have to leave. If Russia is forced to leave, then 140 million people will be deprived of going to the highest court in Europe, which is very important for Russian citizens.\\\\\" Jagland added, \\\\\"We have to think of the following: Will Europe be better off, safer, with Russia on its own, without being part of the judicial system of Europe?\\\\\" And therein lies the paradox and the dilemma. Russia\\'s continued formal membership in the Council of Europe while it continues to occupy Crimea and wage war on Ukraine -- and while it insists it does not need to abide by the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights -- makes a mockery of the council\\'s founding principles. But removing Russia from the Council of Europe would mean that Russian citizens would not have access to the possibility for judicial redress in Europe\\'s human rights court of last resort. And this is something many Russians who have seen their rights violated have long counted on -- even if the judicial redress risks becoming only symbolic.\\\\n\\\\nRussia may crash out of Council of Europe, says rights chief - POLITICO\\\\n\\\\nIf Russia keeps being excluded from the elections of key personnel at the Council of Europe, Moscow could leave the group.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Unlike in Europe, Life in Suburbs of Russian Cities is Boring and Unbearable, Gubin Says\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 3 - The fight over renovation of the five-storey apartment blocks in Moscow has called attention to something anyone who visits a Russian city knows but seldom comments upon: everything is concentrated in the city center, and almost nothing is available in the \\\\\"sleeping\\\\\" regions surrounding it. In a commentary for the Rosbalt news agency, Dmitry Gubin, a writer and television personality, says that a truly contemporary city is not about skyscrapers or trade centers but one in which every district has its own life and personality, something that is not true of Russian cities (rosbalt.ru\\\\/blogs\\\\/2017\\\\/09\\\\/02\\\\/1643097.html). Instead and in contrast to cities in Europe, everything in Russian cities is concentrated in the center and at the edges of the megalopolises is only a boring and unbearable \\\\\"emptiness.\\\\\" In the latter places, \\\\\"it is impossible to live because there is nothing there, while in the center it is impossible to live because everyone is trying to get to the center from where there is nothing.\\\\\" In fact, he says, this \\\\\"actually is a copy of Russia in miniature\\\\\" and so should perhaps not surprise anyone despite the fact that in cities at least, many things could be done to change the situation and for not much of an investment as has happened in some post-Soviet cities in Kazakhstan, for example. But so far, the hyper-centralization of Russia continues to be reproduced and reinforced by the hyper-centralization of Russian cities, thereby creating conditions in which few are happy with where they are living and why.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Hanafi Rite Basis of What Moscow Calls \\'Moderate Islam,\\' Islamic Scholar Says\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, September 3 - Post-Soviet officials and commentators often express their preference for what they call \\\\\"moderate Islam,\\\\\" a term that typically means little more than a kind of Islam like that permitted in Soviet times confined to the mosque and not posing any challenge to the powers that be. But Kyrgyz sociologist Mukanmediy Asanbekov argues that moderate Islam in fact has deep roots within the Islamic tradition, reflecting the ideas and values of the Hanafi rite, the largest of the four legal schools of Sunni Islam (easttime.ru\\\\/analytics\\\\/raznoe\\\\/umerennyi-islam-kak-relig-organ-ispoved-islam-khanafitskogo-tolka\\\\/13493). Muslims of the Hanafi rite are the most numerous and widespread of all Sunni religious communities, numbering more than 750 million across the world and dominating the Islamic parts of all the post-Soviet states except Azerbaijan, which at least traditionally is two-thirds Shiia. Asanbekov points to five things which he suggests characterize Muslims of the Hanafi rite: they are conscious of their dominant position in Islam, they typically enjoy good relations with the government under which they live, they do not impose a requirement for social action on their members, relations between believers and mosques are relatively free form, and hierarchy is largely absent in their practices. Because they generally avoid political action, the Hanafis are a source of political stability in the societies where they are predominant. Thus, they appear to others and are in fact genuinely \\\\\"moderate\\\\\" at least in comparison to the three other legal schools of Sunni Islam, Salafism and Shiite Islam. Because of their freer and more tolerant approach, Hanafi Muslims tend to be less religiously active than other Muslim trends. That is, those who identify as such, including the majority in Russia and all other post-Soviet states except Azerbaijan, take an active role in religious life far less often than do those who follow stricter trends. Another important characteristic of this trend in Islam, the sociologist continues, is that there is little internal organization of the mosque to promote the spread of Islam, to get involved with specific social conflicts, or to take part in the politics of the country in which its members find themselves. \\\\\"Consequently,\\\\\" Asanbekov says, \\\\\"the activity of a religious organization of Hanafis is limited to the fulfillment of spiritual functions alone, the satisfaction of religious requirements or believers and the maximum distancing from political processes. That is why when people speak about moderate Islam, they have in mind above all this Muslim religious organization.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFour Hospitalized As Teen Opens Fire At School Near Moscow\\\\n\\\\nFour people, including a teacher and three schoolchildren, have been hospitalized after a 15-year-old teenager fired an air rifle and tossed handmade smoke grenades in a school northeast of Moscow. ...\\\\n\\\\nRussia to receive new Koalitsiya-SV self-propelled howitzers | Defence Blog\\\\n\\\\nThe Burevestnik Central Research Institute (part of Uralvagonzavod) has been awarded a contract by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation to supply a 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV 152-mm self-propelled howitzers. \\\\\"The state tests of the Koalitsiya-SV self-propelled howitzer will be completed in 2019.

It can be used for self-defense against air and ground targets. The primary weapon is a 152mm 2A88 cannon, equipped with a muzzle brake and a recoil system. Ammunition capacity of the self-propelled gun is 50 to 70 shells and the maximum firing range is approximately 70km. An automatic loader with pneumatic rammer allows the cannon to fire up to eight rounds a minute.\\\\n\\\\nBelarus Reports\\\\n\\\\nPutin\\'s War Games With a Vengeance in Belarus: Will He Ever Leave?\\\\n\\\\nRussia\\'s president wants to show NATO he is ready for a fight.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said the U.S. would be circulating a proposed resolution on North Korea this week, and would push for a vote next week. While it\\'s not clear what that language will say, both China and Russia made it clear they were unlikely to support more sanctions, and instead played up their joint call for North Korea to stop its military aggression in return for both South Korea and the U.S. to stop their military exercises. Haley called that idea \\\\\"insulting.\\\\\" \\\\\"The idea that some have suggested, a so-called freeze for freeze, is insulting,\\\\\" she said. \\\\\"When a rogue regime has a nuclear weapon, and an ICBM pointed at you, you do not take steps to lower your guard.

But after she spoke, both Russia and China made it clear they don\\'t like that idea. Liu Jeiyi, China\\'s ambassador to the UN, promoted the China-Russia plan as \\\\\"practical and feasible,\\\\\" and noted it would call on the U.S. and South Korea to \\\\\"suspend their large scale military exercises.\\\\\" Russia\\'s ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, noted that Haley summarized how past UN resolutions failed to contain North Korea, and argued they failed because they relied on sanctions, not dialogue.\\\\n\\\\nElectromagnetic Pulse: North Korea\\'s Latest Threat Against U.S. - WSJ\\\\n\\\\nPyongyang\\'s warnings now include a tactic long discussed by some experts: an EMP triggered by a nuclear weapon that would aim to shut down the U.S. electricity grid and electronic devices.\\\\n\\\\nNorth Korea : EMP attack threat to United States\\\\n\\\\nDETONATING a thermonuclear warhead 400km above Washington would instantly fry most of the nation\\'s power grid -- and electronics.\\\\n\\\\nRalph Peters | The moral answer to North Korea threats: Take them out! | New York Post\\\\n\\\\nBetter a million dead North Koreans than a thousand dead Americans.

South Korea and the U.S. are discussing the dispatch of F-22 and F-35B fighter jets on a rotational basis as part of efforts to boost extended deterrence against the North\\'s threats, they said. The allies are known to be discussing the deployment of U.S. strategic assets on a quarterly basis at U.S. air base in Osan, south of Seoul or Kunsan Air Base in the southwest of the divided peninsula, they added. The U.S. has periodically sent strategic assets to South Korea, including B-1B bombers, as a show of force when North Korea\\'s provocative acts are escalated. But a possible rotational deployment reflects growing concerns about a fast advance in North Korea\\'s nuclear and missile programs. Experts said that the U.S. seems to accept Seoul\\'s call for the U.S. to offer more powerful and effective extended deterrence as some lawmakers and experts here raised the need for South Korea\\'s nuclear armament. Extended deterrence refers to the U.S. commitment to mobilize its full range of conventional and strategic military assets, including nuclear capabilities, to protect its allies. \\\\\"It is believed that the U.S. is positive toward rotational deployment of F-22 and F-35B jets over Korea as it remains firm in countering North Korea\\'s provocations,\\\\\" a government source said.

The Government of Denmark proposes to amend the Law on the Continental Shelf, which provides for the refusal to construct pipelines in the event of an environmental threat. The new bill assumes that the application for approval of pipelines can be examined by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \\\\\"Decision-making on requests for construction of pipelines in territorial waters is so specific that it is more suitable for discussion at the ministerial level,\\\\\" the commentary to the bill says. According to Politiken, the government of Denmark is afraid that the gas supplies through Nord Stream will be turned into a political tool by the Russian authorities.

The tragedy was proven to be the result of Stalin\\'s \\\\\"collectivization\\\\\" agricultural policies. However, it is still debated whether the deaths were a result of mismanagement and the failure of collectivization, or of a conscious plan to exterminate the Ukrainians in an act of deliberate genocide. Anne Applebaum\\'s Red Famine: Stalin\\'s War on Ukraine (Penguin, 2017) offers a new contribution to this discussion, drawing upon archival sources as well as first-hand accounts of the famine, or Holodomor, as it is known in Russian and Ukrainian historiography. Applebaum is known for her extensive writings on Soviet history, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning Gulag: A History (Doubleday, 2003) and Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944-1956 (Allen Lane, 2014). Red Famine, a new addition to her works on the USSR, claims that Holodomor was engineered in order to destroy Ukrainian identity and the Ukrainian peasantry, which posed a threat to Stalin\\'s power. Red Famine naturally appeared on the radar of Sheila Fitzpatrick, an acclaimed historian of the Soviet Union and author of works such as Stalin\\'s Peasants (OUP, 1994), on the same subject of the Ukrainian famine, and Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times: Soviet Russia in the 1930s (OUP, 1999), an account of \\\\\"people\\'s history\\\\\" in the shadow of the Great Terror. In her review in the Guardian, Fitzpatrick spoke positively of Red Famine as \\\\\"a superior work of popular history.\\\\\" However, she ultimately reaches different conclusions to Applebaum, echoing those she offered in Stalin\\'s Peasants: that what Stalin wanted was not the death of millions of Ukrainians, but reaping as much of the harvest as possible, irrespective of the cost in human life.\\\\n\\\\nElon Musk on Twitter: \\\\\"China, Russia, soon all countries w strong computer science.

Priority in issuing visas will be given to civil servants, employees of international governmental organizations with offices in the United States, such as the United Nations, and diplomats from other countries who need to pay a visit to America after a working trip to Russia. Since September 1, US authorities have closed the Consulate General of the Russian Federation in San Francisco.

But we are good, and look at me - I\\'m fit.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIn late August, the Lebanese Army (LAF) began the \\\\\"Dawn of the Outskirts\\\\\" operation to oust 600 Isil militants from 120 sq km of mountainous territory in Ras Baalbeck on Lebanon\\'s north-eastern border with Syria. Troops made signficant progress against the terror group, which had occupied the land since 2014. Less than 10 days later, Lebanon\\'s President announced the job done.\\\\n\\\\nEmbedded with Lebanese army troops, journalists were permitted entry to land retaken just days previously from IS militants.\\\\n\\\\nConvoys of desert buggies, Humvees and pick-up trucks kicked up swirls of dust alongside burnt-out vehicles, which soldiers said had belonged to IS militants.\\\\n\\\\nTroop morale appeared high as we passed groups lounging around their armed personnel carriers, flicking V for victory signs and posing in their battle vests.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We hope they [IS] try to attack again so we can show them what we have got,\\\\\" a senior ranking officer boasted.\\\\n\\\\nThe battle on this little-known front against IS - which is losing territory across Iraq and Syria - was mounted with multi-million dollar military aid packages from Britain and the USA.\\\\n\\\\nAn army source in Beirut told the New Statesman before the assault began that 90 per cent of the weapons in use were supplied by the USA, and UK-provided skills and equipment were essential.\\\\n\\\\nLike most things in Lebanon, though, that is not something everyone agrees on.\\\\n\\\\nThe UK generally plays down its military involvement in the Mediterranean country, while the US is much more public. Earlier this month, it published a long list of weapons it had supplied to the Lebanese Army in the past year alone, including 50 automatic grenade launchers, 4,000 M4 rifles, and over half a million rounds of ammunition. Total spending in the past decade tops more than a billion US dollars.\\\\n\\\\nAs well as ousting IS, the operation saw the north-east area come under Lebanese state control for the first time. Up until now, it has been an unmarked border zone.\\\\n\\\\nTraining on UK soil, such as that described by the Lebanese soldier, has not been confirmed by British authorities. But substantial military aid from Britain is intended to keep Lebanon\\'s borders secure. The UK has been delivering a \\\\\"train and equip\\\\\" programme for Land Border Regiments, who oversee the north-eastern area. By April 2017, the Government had delivered 320 Land Rovers, 3300 sets of body armour, a secure radio communication network, 30 border watchtowers and over 20 Forward Operating Bases along the border, spending \\\\u00a361.5m.\\\\n\\\\nAll this has worked relatively well in creating a proper army out of what was once an ineffective and unorganised non-institution.\\\\n\\\\nLebanese soldiers are, naturally, defensive, when faced with the idea that they wouldn\\'t be able to cope without UK and US backing. Still, one soldier, who like nearly all troops deployed for the anti-IS offensive asked to remain anonymous, admitted things would be much tougher without it: \\\\\"The help from the UK and US supports us. We would survive without it, but it would be harder and there would be many more dead and injured.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n\\\\nBritain and the USA do not simply dole out military aid to Lebanon because they feel like it. It is a key way in which western governments hope to shape alliances in the Middle East. The idea in western policy is that a strong Lebanese Army will serve several purposes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The US and UK calculate that reinforcing the Lebanese state and its security apparatus will help Lebanon meet the successive challenges of Sunni Jihadi groups threatening to overrun the region,\\\\\" says Middle East analyst Tobias Schneider.\\\\n\\\\nThe second idea is that a strong army - one of the few institutions that has cross-sectarian support in Lebanon - will lessen the influence and power of Hezbollah. The Lebanese political party\\'s military wing is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK and the US governments. That would contain Iran\\'s influence in Lebanon - Hezbollah is a proxy of the Islamic Republic - and reduce the likelihood of a new war with Israel.\\\\n\\\\nBut there is a problem in the west\\'s calculation that a strong army equals a weak Hezbollah.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Hezbollah today being a pillar of Shia politics in the country, there won\\'t ever be sufficient political consensus in Lebanon for the army to directly challenge or confront the \\'Party of God,\\'\\\\\" continues Schneider, referring to Hezbollah by its name in English.\\\\n\\\\nHezbollah has wide-ranging support and political alliances in Lebanon, stretching beyond its Shi\\'ite core to other sects. Lebanese convention dictates that the President must be Christian. The incumbent, Michel Aoun, is in power with Hezbollah support. Strengthening the Army will not eliminate the wide-held belief that the militia has a legitimate role as an anti-Israel force.\\\\n\\\\nA staunch ally of the Assad regime in Syria, Hezbollah has played down the importance of foreign aid to the Lebanese Army.\\\\n\\\\nInstead, in a speech this week in Baalbeck, a Hezbollah stronghold in the Bekaa Valley, Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah greeted an ecstatic crowd with the idea that defeating IS meant successfully foiling a US-Israeli plot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The US-Israeli plot in the region failed and the US-Israeli dreams that were put on ISIL and other terrorist groups fell\\\\\", Nasrallah told an audience of tens of thousands of people, who included girls screaming like fans at a One Direction concert. He spoke via video link, blaming security fears for his longstanding absence from public appearances.\\\\n\\\\nHezbollah draws supporters into the belief that \\\\\"the resistance\\\\\" - Hezbollah fighters - and an alliance with the Syrian Army are behind the Lebanese Army\\'s success, not the US or UK aid. On the same day that the latter launched the Dawn of the Outskirts operation, Hezbollah and the Syrian Army began an assault on IS fighters from the Syrian side. A week later, both parties announced ceasefires almost simultaneously.\\\\n\\\\nThat belief goes right down to the Lebanese person in the street, at least in some parts of the country.

The Sri Lanka Navy, the US Embassy in Colombo and the India Foundation took the lead in these brain storming talkathons.\\\\n\\\\nFor Sri Lanka, it is a recognition that important players on the world stage and especially in and around the Indian Ocean, are interested parties to these dialogues. Had Prime Minister Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike\\'s Indian Ocean Peace Zone (IOPZ) proposal to the UN General Assembly in 1971 aimed at stopping the proliferation of military bases and imposing \\'rules of the road\\' for states been taken seriously, things might have been different today as these seas witness an escalation of tension and competing national interests.\\\\n\\\\nIndia was not keen then, wanting an IOPZ regime that eliminated only \\'foreign\\' (US and others)bases. Even though the Non Aligned Movement supported the proposal, the IOPZ was led to a slow painless death. Today, with the emergence of a Blue water Chinese Navy, everyone else is getting excited over the rights for all parties to have safe trade, air and sea navigation over the Indian Ocean.\\\\n\\\\nThe other positive factor is that by this engagement, as far as Sri Lanka is concerned, there is a marked shift away from yesteryear\\'s pre-occupation on allegations of human rights violations. This was what dominated the foreign policy agenda of the US and West. With the US State Department now being sidelined by the new dispensation in Washington, the Department\\'s holier-than-thou approach selectively picking on some countries and not others, has been thrown out of the window, and Sri Lanka can now look more to the future than the past.\\\\n\\\\nClearly, the US is left to rue this foreign policy miscalculation viz-a-viz Sri Lanka as China made quick inroads into the Sri Lankan economy in the meantime, and advanced its own geo-strategist game plan getting a firm foot hold in this country through the Colombo Port City and the Hambantota harbor projects. With the US State Department downgraded and itsDefence Department given the upper hand under the Trump Administration, it does not necessarily follow that it is good tidings for Sri Lanka and that the world is going to be a better place. No doubt, the US Navy\\'s Pacific Command based in Hawaii is renewing old contacts and cultivating new ones with its counterparts in Sri Lanka in a bid to counter growing Chinese influence. The super powers are making their moves on the global chess-board.\\\\n\\\\nWhile India sent a high-level External Affairs Minister for the Indian Ocean conference, she had earlier sent a senior official from the ruling BJP on a quiet mission to meet the President and Prime Minister to express her concerns (to put it mildly) with developments surrounding the Hambantota harbour and Sri Lanka\\'s virtual capitulation to China on the issue.\\\\n\\\\nThe entire region is once again on the boil and the Indian Ocean must not become another hotspot like the South China Sea. Only a fortnight ago, on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Independence of both, India and Pakistan we had mentioned how sans a solution to the seven decade long Jammu-Kashmir dispute between the two countries, they are getting drawn further apart andmore into the laps of US (India) and China (Pakistan). Non Alignment is seemingly irrelevant to both.\\\\n\\\\nThis week, Pakistan asked the US Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs not to stop over in Islamabad on her way to Colombo for the Indian Ocean conference in retaliation to accusations by Washington that Pakistan was harbouring terrorists. India has just about resisted a push by China to bulldoze its way into building a highway through Bhutan having already planned one through Pakistan\\'s Baluchistan region to run rings round India.\\\\n\\\\nIn the midst of this, India is launching a South Asia Maritime and Logistics Forum next week in Mumbai, backed by the World Bank, to promote regional trade. Sri Lanka cannot take a \\\\\"frog in the well\\'\\' attitude in the fast moving external scenario unfolding, mindful as it ought to be, that there are currents and under-currents in the Indian Ocean and that its geo-political location is a \\'double-edged sword\\'. Sri Lanka cannot fall on its sword.\\\\n\\\\nIt is unfortunate that the contribution of local international relations think tanks to this week\\'s dialogue has been nil. Ad-hocism therefore still rules the roost, and without a national strategy, or plan, it only allows corrupt political leaders - past and present, to revel in this playing field at the expense of the future of the country.\\\\n\\\\nRejection of Elections\\\\n\\\\nWhile there is endless debate on Local Government and Provincial Council elections among political parties, last week\\'s announcement from the Election Commission that there is a slowing down of young adults registering to vote must surely jolt political leaders. Some may already be planning methodologies to take advantage of such a situation. But one of the reasons attributed for this drop - voter apathy with politicians - must hurt politicians who believe they are doing so much for the country.\\\\n\\\\nOne is not sure how the Elections CommissionChairman came to the irresistible conclusion that there seems to be a vote of no confidence among youth that political parties are not delivering the goods. Even so, politicians with an ear to the ground might grudgingly concede, it is a fact. One consolation for Sri Lankan politicians is that this is a world-wide phenomenon. Starting with the rejection of the Congress Party in India, the Brexit vote, the defeat of the Clintons and then the outcome in France there is a trend to be seen. In France, no sooner had they elected a young President his popularity ratings have plummeted. There is dissatisfaction with the Establishment everywhere.\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, very soon we will see the spectacle of wanna-be councilors to Municipal and Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas and Provincial Councils flocking to different party headquarters for interviews to be candidates. What is this contradiction?That is because they know that is where the \\'gravy train\\' is -duty free car permits to sell and become millionaires overnight, overseas jaunts, other perks and privileges. While that queue will be a mile long, the queue to register as voters for these elected bodies is receding. Res ipsaloquitor; the facts speak for themselves.\",\"url\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/www.sundaytimes.lk\\\\/170903\\\\/editorial\\\\/indian-ocean-on-the-boil-no-peace-zone-257670.html\"},\"22\":{\"source\":\"Ya Libnan\",\"text\":\"BY LIZZIE PORTER\\\\n\\\\nOn a craggy hilltop near Lebanon\\'s border with Syria, a Lebanese soldier is describing the British countryside.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I went to Wales and the north of England for training in 2013,\\\\\" he says. \\\\\"There were sheep and cows and green fields.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nKnowing it is a sensitive topic, he is loath to expand.

But we are good, and look at me - I\\'m fit.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIn late August, the Lebanese Army (LAF) began the \\\\\"Dawn of the Outskirts\\\\\" operation to oust 600 Isil militants from 120 sq km of mountainous territory in Ras Baalbeck on Lebanon\\'s north-eastern border with Syria. Troops made signficant progress against the terror group, which had occupied the land since 2014. Less than 10 days later, Lebanon\\'s President announced the job done.\\\\n\\\\nEmbedded with Lebanese army troops, journalists were permitted entry to land retaken just days previously from IS militants.\\\\n\\\\nConvoys of desert buggies, Humvees and pick-up trucks kicked up swirls of dust alongside burnt-out vehicles, which soldiers said had belonged to IS militants.\\\\n\\\\nTroop morale appeared high as we passed groups lounging around their armed personnel carriers, flicking V for victory signs and posing in their battle vests.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We hope they [IS] try to attack again so we can show them what we have got,\\\\\" a senior ranking officer boasted.\\\\n\\\\nThe battle on this little-known front against IS - which is losing territory across Iraq and Syria - was mounted with multi-million dollar military aid packages from Britain and the USA.\\\\n\\\\nAn army source in Beirut told the New Statesman before the assault began that 90 per cent of the weapons in use were supplied by the USA, and UK-provided skills and equipment were essential.\\\\n\\\\nLike most things in Lebanon, though, that is not something everyone agrees on.\\\\n\\\\nThe UK generally plays down its military involvement in the Mediterranean country, while the US is much more public. Earlier this month, it published a long list of weapons it had supplied to the Lebanese Army in the past year alone, including 50 automatic grenade launchers, 4,000 M4 rifles, and over half a million rounds of ammunition. Total spending in the past decade tops more than a billion US dollars.\\\\n\\\\nAs well as ousting IS, the operation saw the north-east area come under Lebanese state control for the first time. Up until now, it has been an unmarked border zone.\\\\n\\\\nTraining on UK soil, such as that described by the Lebanese soldier, has not been confirmed by British authorities. But substantial military aid from Britain is intended to keep Lebanon\\'s borders secure. The UK has been delivering a \\\\\"train and equip\\\\\" programme for Land Border Regiments, who oversee the north-eastern area. By April 2017, the Government had delivered 320 Land Rovers, 3300 sets of body armour, a secure radio communication network, 30 border watchtowers and over 20 Forward Operating Bases along the border, spending \\\\u00a361.5m.\\\\n\\\\nAll this has worked relatively well in creating a proper army out of what was once an ineffective and unorganised non-institution.\\\\n\\\\nLebanese soldiers are, naturally, defensive, when faced with the idea that they wouldn\\'t be able to cope without UK and US backing. Still, one soldier, who like nearly all troops deployed for the anti-IS offensive asked to remain anonymous, admitted things would be much tougher without it: \\\\\"The help from the UK and US supports us. We would survive without it, but it would be harder and there would be many more dead and injured.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n***\\\\n\\\\nBritain and the USA do not simply dole out military aid to Lebanon because they feel like it. It is a key way in which western governments hope to shape alliances in the Middle East. The idea in western policy is that a strong Lebanese Army will serve several purposes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The US and UK calculate that reinforcing the Lebanese state and its security apparatus will help Lebanon meet the successive challenges of Sunni Jihadi groups threatening to overrun the region,\\\\\" says Middle East analyst Tobias Schneider.\\\\n\\\\nThe second idea is that a strong army - one of the few institutions that has cross-sectarian support in Lebanon - will lessen the influence and power of Hezbollah. The Lebanese political party\\'s military wing is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK and the US governments. That would contain Iran\\'s influence in Lebanon - Hezbollah is a proxy of the Islamic Republic - and reduce the likelihood of a new war with Israel.\\\\n\\\\nBut there is a problem in the west\\'s calculation that a strong army equals a weak Hezbollah.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Hezbollah today being a pillar of Shia politics in the country, there won\\'t ever be sufficient political consensus in Lebanon for the army to directly challenge or confront the \\'Party of God,\\'\\\\\" continues Schneider, referring to Hezbollah by its name in English.\\\\n\\\\nHezbollah has wide-ranging support and political alliances in Lebanon, stretching beyond its Shi\\'ite core to other sects. Lebanese convention dictates that the President must be Christian. The incumbent, Michel Aoun, is in power with Hezbollah support. Strengthening the Army will not eliminate the wide-held belief that the militia has a legitimate role as an anti-Israel force.\\\\n\\\\nA staunch ally of the Assad regime in Syria, Hezbollah has played down the importance of foreign aid to the Lebanese Army.\\\\n\\\\nInstead, in a speech this week in Baalbeck, a Hezbollah stronghold in the Bekaa Valley, Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah greeted an ecstatic crowd with the idea that defeating IS meant successfully foiling a US-Israeli plot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The US-Israeli plot in the region failed and the US-Israeli dreams that were put on ISIL and other terrorist groups fell\\\\\", Nasrallah told an audience of tens of thousands of people, who included girls screaming like fans at a One Direction concert. He spoke via video link, blaming security fears for his longstanding absence from public appearances.\\\\n\\\\nHezbollah draws supporters into the belief that \\\\\"the resistance\\\\\" - Hezbollah fighters - and an alliance with the Syrian Army are behind the Lebanese Army\\'s success, not the US or UK aid. On the same day that the latter launched the Dawn of the Outskirts operation, Hezbollah and the Syrian Army began an assault on IS fighters from the Syrian side. A week later, both parties announced ceasefires almost simultaneously.\\\\n\\\\nThat belief goes right down to the Lebanese person in the street, at least in some parts of the country.

Russian-Belarussian exercises West-2017 will be held on the territory of Belarus on September 14-20. They will involve 13,000 servicemen. Russian troops began arriving in Belarus on August 15. The exercises will be held at six training ranges in Belarus: near Lepel, Barysau, Losvidz, Asipovichy, the air force and air defense training ranges Ruzhanski and Damanauski, as well as near the village of Dretun.

Whether it will happen or not - that\\'s a different matter,\\\\\" Badrak said at a press conference in Kyiv on Friday, September 1. \\\\\"Why do we think that the threats have increased today, and why do we believe that they have undergone transformation? There is a number of factors that signal this,\\\\\" Badrak said. According to him, \\\\\"the relations between the Russian Federation and the United States have deteriorated significantly.\\\\\" In particular, the expert noted the symbolic support of Ukraine and the arrival of the Pentagon chief and representatives of other NATO member states, which caused \\\\\"frenzied hysteria\\\\\" in Russia. At the same time, Badrak believes that in general, \\\\\"the Western world is happy with the situation when Ukraine is a buffer zone between the West and Russia.\\\\\" \\\\\"Europe is aware of this, and especially the Europeans are comfortable with this,\\\\\" he said. In addition, the expert is convinced that the \\\\\"attrition warfare\\\\\" does not give Russia the results that it expected. \\\\\"The presidential election is approaching, and Putin will need some victories in March 2018, certain things that he can give his society to qualify for another victory and continue his \\'reign,\\'\\\\\" Badrak said. In addition, he stressed, today the General Staff of the Russian armed forces has a \\\\\"pragmatic understanding of the weakness of Ukraine\\'s defense potential.\\\\\" \\\\\"The evaluation of what has been done in Ukraine in the three years gives grounds to Russian analysts to say that Ukraine is not ready for a large-scale war, for a sudden large-scale strike,\\\\\" Badrak said. Meanwhile, Russia \\\\\"has substantially increased its capabilities,\\\\\" the expert said. \\\\\"According to our data, those units that are on the front line... the level of equipping these structures, in these units with new weapons, military equipment has reached 58% as of 2016. As of the end of 2017, it was planned to achieve 62% of re-equipment with new systems,\\\\\" he said and noted that this is a very serious challenge for Ukraine. In addition, according to Badrak, the issue of securing a land corridor for Crimea remains pressing. Any development of military success, if it takes place, will also be a formal achievement for the Kremlin. \\\\\"Therefore, the probability of a military operation before the election is quite high,\\\\\" he said. Badrak also noted that a military operation \\\\\"cannot start on its own - Russia needs to create a pretext for this.\\\\\" \\\\\"Already today we see very serious work - pro-Russian movements, Russian agents are becoming more active. And in fact, information activity gravitates towards the political sphere,\\\\\" the expert said.

Director of the Kyiv-based Center for Army Conversion and Disarmament Studies Valentyn Badrak has said there is a high possibility of military actions by Russia against Ukraine before the Russian 2018 presidential election. \\\\\"The likelihood of such an operation before the election is rather high,\\\\\" Badrak said on Friday during a press conference. \\\\\"Relations between Russia and the U.S. have worsened. The symbolic support of Ukraine by the head of the U.S. Department of Defense and ministers of eight NATO countries irked Russia greatly, something we have not seen since the start of the war,\\\\\" he said, adding that Russia military leaders are not impressed by Ukraine\\'s military potential. \\\\\"What has been done in Ukraine over three years gives Russian analysts grounds to say that Ukraine is not ready for a massive war, a surprise strike. Meanwhile, Russia has increased its capabilities...,\\\\\" he said, adding that Ukraine as a buffer zone between the Russia and the West suits many Europeans.\\\\n\\\\nRussia moved Tochka-U tactical missiles division to Ukrainian border - InformNapalm.org (English)\\\\n\\\\nA video titled Volgograd. Train with military equipment showing a Russian military train was posted on youtube on August 22, 2017. Volunteers of InformNapalm volunteer intelligence community analyzed the video and identified that the train consisting of 40 flat cars and passenger wagons transported 47 items of military equipment and 170-200 people. The train was filmed in the outskirts of Volgograd and was moving west towards Ukrainian border. We identified a full tactical missile battalion, which consists of 2 Tochka-U batteries with additional missiles, signal equipment, mobile generators and mobile kitchens. Most likely, the battalion belongs to 464th Missile Brigade (Kapustin Yar, Znamensk) or to 60-th Combat Training Center (Kapustin Yar, Znamensk).

Vladimir Putin has been racing to bolster the Russian military\\'s fighting abilities with frequent, large-scale exercises near his country\\'s western borders. But one recent story from Glavny, which covers western Russia, indicates that the exercises are taking a toll on infrastructure and local governments which are swarmed by armored vehicles. In recent days, 574 vehicles of the crack 74th Guards Air Assault Division set off at night from its base at Pskov near the Estonian border for a training site at Strugi Krasnye some 40 miles to the northeast. The lumbering convoy headed up a cracked, pitted, asphalt-covered federal highway, tearing up the road and inflicting more than half-a-million dollars in damage. Twenty of the division\\'s vehicles broke down during the journey for a failure rate of 3.5 percent, which isn\\'t bad, demonstrating the division\\'s ability to move on short notice with relatively few mechanical losses. But the damage upset local authorities. \\\\\"It\\'s scary to imagine what will happen when they go back,\\\\\" Simeon Gutsu of the Pskov\\'s region Commission for Road Safety told Glavny. It\\'s a small anecdote, but given the scale of Russia\\'s recent exercises -- 2017\\'s Zapad exercise involved some 100,000 troops -- involving heavier vehicles than what the 74th Guards operates, it\\'s likely that wear and tear isn\\'t contained to Pskov. This is in a country ranked 123rd in the world in the quality of its road infrastructure according to the World Economic Forum, tied with Sierra Leone, Gabon, Venezuela and Nepal. However, the bulk of the Russian army moves by rail, where Russia performs well. Nevertheless, the news spread to Russian military bloggers who were impressed by the division\\'s readiness, given the 74th Guards\\' role as an elite unit designed to fight at a moment\\'s notice. They were less impressed with the damage. \\\\\"So that\\'s who spoils the roads,\\\\\" one blogger stated. \\\\\"It\\'s familiar,\\\\\" came a reply. \\\\\"Especially after summer 2014.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nVladimir Frolov | In Ukraine, Russia Wants Political Control, Not Territory (Op-ed) | Moscow Times\\\\n\\\\nThe meeting between Moscow\\'s and Washington\\'s top envoys on Ukraine exposes fault lines\\\\n\\\\nMoscow\\'s Man on Minsk - DFRLab - Medium\\\\n\\\\nLast week, the new United States Special Representative to Ukraine Ambassador Kurt Volker met with Russian presidential aide Vladislav Surkov in Minsk to discuss the implementation of the peace...\\\\n\\\\nRussia Sees Artificial Intelligence as Key to World Domination\\\\n\\\\nComments by Russian president are helping push digital arms race to new heights\\\\n\\\\nWho Putin thinks will rule the world - CNN\\\\n\\\\nOn the first day of the new school year, students in Russia learned an important lesson directly from their President -- who will be the ruler of the world.\\\\n\\\\n\\'Whoever leads in AI will rule the world\\': Putin to Russian children on Knowledge Day -- RT News\\\\n\\\\nVladimir Putin spoke with students about science in an open lesson on September 1, the start of the school year in Russia.

They must realize that \\\\\"if something acts like a dog, it is a dog\\\\\" and that \\\\\"bandit isn\\'t a course word, it is simply the name of a profession, which, like any other profession - bookkeeper, military officer, or prostitute - leaves its mark on the outlook and mentality of an individual,\\\\\" the Moscow commentator says (kasparov.ru\\\\/material.php?id=59A588D2BF8B4). And this, rather than the nominal position \\\\\"is the defining factor: everything else is secondary.\\\\\" \\\\\"A bandit may turn up in the role of businessman (the majority of bandits are nominally that), a bureaucrat, a policeman, a judge or even the president of a nuclear power. None of these other positions means that he ceases to be a bandit, and consequently for achieving results in dealing with them one must adopt methods\\\\\" used to deal with criminals. Unfortunately, Shekhtman says, \\\\\"this is something that neither Obama nor Nemtsov wants to understand. He continues: \\\\\"In the struggle with a bandit, one can appeal only to force. Even when you appeal to legal institutions, you all the same are appealing to force, to the state apparatus of force which by definition is stronger than any band. Law doesn\\'t work by itself - law works through a complex system where behind the judge always stands the policeman ... and the jailor.\\\\\" But there are circumstances when there is no such force behind the law because the bandits have taken over that as well. This is the case in Russia now, and the only real possibility of salvation is to create \\\\\"the appearance\\\\\" of such legality so that the bandits will decide that it is better to adapt to that than to continue as they are. \\\\\"Naturally, this is a very risky method of struggle, but it is the only possible one from a position of weakness\\\\\" which is where those in Russia are given the current power of the bandits there at the top. Those \\\\\"who don\\'t play poker with the bandits is [will otherwise] simply be giving everything away.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: New Orthodox Christians and Muslims Authoritarian and Aggressive, Moscow Psychologist Says\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, September 1 - It has long been a commonplace that new members of any religious faith and especially those who have converted from another are more radical in the expression of their beliefs than those who have been members of this or that faith for a long period of time. But now Sergey Yenikolopov, a psychologist at Moscow State University, says that in Russia today, there is another fundamental distinction between those who have been followers of the Russian Orthodox Church or Islam for a long time and those who have joined only recently (novayagazeta.ru\\\\/articles\\\\/2017\\\\/08\\\\/30\\\\/73646-cila-samyy-veskiy-argument). His research shows that the impact of the expansion of the numbers of believers has been \\\\\"exaggerated\\\\\" and that those who have been Orthodox or Islamic for a longtime tend to be more \\\\\"democratic, tolerant and non-aggressive\\\\\" while \\\\\"neophytes [in these faiths] are [more] authoritarian and aggressive.\\\\\" In an interview with Natalya Chernova of Novaya gazeta concerning the rise of violence in Russian society, Yenikolopov says that serious violent crime appears to have fallen but that although \\\\\"there are no statistics about crimes at the edge of petty hooliganism,\\\\\" one has the clear sense that these have become more numerous. Aggression \\\\\"at the individual level,\\\\\" the psychologist says, \\\\\"is one of the best forms of the defense of one\\'s own \\'I\\' in the broadest sense of this word\\\\\" and that it is encouraged by both what appears on television and what is taking place around an individual. When there is a lot of violence in both, people tend to become more violent whatever their starting point is. \\\\\"However paradoxical it may seem,\\\\\" he continues, the fact that contemporary Russian society is \\\\\"a society of free people\\\\\" makes this situation worse. Russians don\\'t know how to cope with freedom and so they rapidly move toward anarchy whenever they feel anger or distress and have the chance. For many, Yenikolopov continues, \\\\\"the socialization of young people passes through an understanding that force is the most weighty argument,\\\\\" a feeling that has intensified as people feel frustration that the social lifts they are promised will help them advance no longer work for most people. They acquire the sense that \\\\\"there are no established rules of the fame or that the rules are different in different circumstances,\\\\\" something amplified by the sense of a break between what people are told and what is \\\\\"the real situation.\\\\\" They want to strike out, and in everyday language, the rule becomes \\\\\"If there is no policeman about, then one can do anything.\\\\\" The government has devoted very little attention to this because society has devoted very little attention to it either. The regime focuses only on those things that it thinks society is worried about. Thus, the murder of a journalist which gets a lot of media attention gets the regime\\'s. The murder of someone else is typically ignored by both. This trend began at the end of the 1980s, the Moscow psychologist says, \\\\\"In Soviet times, however one relates to them, all the same, a militiaman was a militiaman. The cop on the beat had to work in his area. But how long has it been since you have seen one do that? In Soviet times, the policemen knew when people went on vacation.\\\\\" No more. That only encourages people to think they can act however they like. But what may be most fundamental is the attitudes parents pass to their children. In many cases, Yenikolopov concludes, parents communicate the idea that \\\\\"justice is something ephemeral, but force is a good thing.\\\\\" Their children are acting on that now.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Moscow Patriarchate Promoting Peasant Values More than Religious Ones, Cultural Specialist Says\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, September 1 - The Moscow Patriarchate backed by those in the church especially close to Vladimir Putin is promoting the peasant values of the 19th century more consistently than it is disseminating truly Christian ones, according to Ilya Ilyukovich, a theologian specializing on cultural questions. In an essay entitled \\\\\"Peasantry or Christianity? Social Aspect of Present-Day Orthodoxy,\\\\\" the scholar says that the Russian church now works on the basis of an image of Russia that is rooted in the idea that Russia somehow has remained a primarily peasant country (ahilla.ru\\\\/krestyanstvo-ili-hristianstvo-sotsialnye-aspekty-sovremennogo-pravoslaviya\\\\/). The problem here is not that many parishioners are \\\\\"simple people\\\\\" but rather this supposed \\\\\"\\'simplicity\\' is being cultivated by the church itself and supported in an artificial way\\\\\" at a time when Russia has changed but when the church itself has refused to do so, Ilyukovich continues. The priest as the little father of the peasants remains central to the Patriarchate\\'s image of itself. The church hasn\\'t taken note of the rise of a middle class or even of an educated stratum. Instead, it remains rooted in a vision of society from the 19th century or even earlier that is designed to keep the population at the level of irresponsible children the powers will control. The Russian as peasant at the basis of this vision is \\\\\"a child of the land, not independent and not completely responsible for his actions. The figure of the peasant in culture inevitably approaches that of the slave who does not control his existence. Such a peasant-child needs a little father master.\\\\\" This is the world of the notorious Domostroy, of subservience to anyone in power and one whose only demands on the peasant are that he work, tolerate misfortunes, not drink to excess, not revolt and have a strong patriarchal family. He doesn\\'t need any independent qualities at all. That suits the current Kremlin just fine because as in the 19th century, the Russian Orthodox Church today promotes the idea that \\\\\"\\'there is no power that is not from God,\\'\\\\\" and thus encourages not discussion and participation but simply a life of prayer and obedience, the cultural affairs specialist says. \\\\\"Of course,\\\\\" he continues, no one in the hierarchy speaks about this directly. It simply acts that way; and even when it uses texts that could be employed to promote an alternative vision of Russia, it does its best to give them only a \\\\\"peasant\\\\\" reading lest they create problems for the powers that be. And such \\\\\"peasantism\\\\\" extends into the monastic life of the Russian Orthodox Church where the most important tasks are prayer and physical labor not theological discussion and dispute and not an effort to find answers to the most pressing problems of the society around them. Unfortunately, Ilyukovich says, there is little pressure for any change. While some church intellectuals have emerged, the Russian state continues to support this \\\\\"peasant\\\\\" interpretation because it helps keep the population obediently in line - and the hierarchy of the Moscow Patriarchate is quite prepared to go alone. One clear piece of evidence that this is so is the bestselling book by Bishop Tikhon Shevkunov, Unsaintly Saints. Known to be close to Putin, the bishop promotes this peasant vision of the Church and hence of Russia, a vision that is both anti-intellectual and anti-democratic but one that could block the country from any real move forward.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: \\'Donbass in Gorky Park\\' - Moscow\\'s Use of Violence in Ukraine is Coming Back to Haunt Russia\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 31 - The violence Moscow \\\\\"exported\\\\\" to Ukraine and other parts of what the Kremlin claims are parts of \\\\\"the Russian world\\\\\" is coming back to haunt Russia at home, with Russians ever more inclined to see violence as a legitimate means to solve their problems, Kirill Martynov says. In a Novaya gazeta commentary, the Moscow paper\\'s political observer notes that the war against Ukraine continues but that the Russian propaganda outlets are devoting ever less attention to it, a classic case of cynicism in which one begins a war and then forgets about it when other tasks arise (novayagazeta.ru\\\\/articles\\\\/2017\\\\/08\\\\/29\\\\/73634-donbass-v-parke-gorkogo). But almost unnoticed has been the fact that \\\\\"something new\\\\\" has appeared on the screen: violence at home. \\\\\"For three years, the Russian state has succeeded in explaining to its citizens that killing for the right cause is good and acceptable,\\\\\" Martynov says. Now, Russians are having to live with that in their own lives. \\\\\"We have become accustomed to political force,\\\\\" the use of violence by officials against those they see as their enemies. But that is now \\\\\"escaping from under the control of the state.\\\\\" As a result, \\\\\"hooligan attacks on activists and even political murders are our new reality,\\\\\" and one that extends far beyond politics. A signal indication of that was the recent murder in Moscow\\'s Gorky Park where blogger Stanislav Dumkin was killed by a group of hooligans because he wasn\\'t dressed properly in the opinion of the latter and worse a hat and glasses. (Martynov doesn\\'t point to the Machayevism that this reflects.). Despite the horror this murder generated in the media, he says, it shouldn\\'t have surprised anyone because Russians had been well prepared for just such an outrage: \\\\\"attack \\'a Banderite,\\' attack a gay, attack an incorrect theater director, attack a film about the tsar and a ballerina, and finally, attack those dressed not according to expectations.\\\\\" Such attacks have \\\\\"an objective cause\\\\\" - the decline in incomes \\\\\"which (together with other signs of social degradation) has continued almost as long as have lasted our geopolitical successes.\\\\\" When there is no new money, people from top to bottom turn to force to get some of what is left or to compensate for its absence. The wealthy pray on the less wealthy, and \\\\\"ordinary citizens, especially young men who have nothing to lose except their chains form gangs and begin to struggle for their place\\\\\" in what is an ever less bright environment, taught by the regime that force of all kinds is the appropriate way to do that. by \\\\\"At the end of the 1980s, as Soviet society was dying, the most promising profession already was service in the rackets.\\\\\" Now, those who have the means of violence, first the siloviki and then the population, are using those means to compensate for the losses they are suffering. But it is obvious that the siloviki \\\\\"have already lost the initiative\\\\\" to the latter. According to Martynov, \\\\\"the ideology of the new Russia asserts that there exist entire classes of people whom it is correct to destroy. And neither the magistracy nor the police can speak out against such a situation. The consolidation around \\'the Ukrainian question\\' has ended and the taboo on the use of force has been lifted.\\\\\" In short, \\\\\"the Ukrainian war has turned into a war of all against all\\\\\" in Russia.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Russian Assembly Calls for Naming Streets after Muslims Who Died Defending Traditional Values\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 31 - The World Russian Popular Assembly has called for naming streets in Russia in the memory of those Islamic leaders \\\\\"who at the price of their lives defended traditional values,\\\\\" an appeal Muslim leaders welcome as highlighting both the strength of Islam in Russia and the convergence of Russian Orthodoxy and the Muslim community. \\\\\"It is deeply symbolic,\\\\\" Mufti Albir Krganov says, \\\\\"that on the eve of Kurban Bayram, the World Russian Popular Assembly has come out with this initiative. This is an indicator of the internal situation of our society and a mark of the deep mutual respect between our peoples and religions\\\\\" (interfax-religion.ru\\\\/?act=news&div=68027). Among those who may be candidates for such honors are Valilulla Yakupov, the Tatarstan mufti who was killed in Kazan in July 2012, and Said Atsayev, better known as Said Chirkeyskiy who was killed in Daghestan in the same year. Those are individuals about whom there might be little controversay. But in reporting this idea, Krganov points to some others whose names may soon grace Russian streets but only at the price of sparking new controversies. Among them is Mukhammat-Safar Bayazitov, who opposed the 1917 revolutions and who then in 1937 was executed by Stalin. The Moscow mufti says that the Spiritual Assembly of Muslims of Russia which he heads \\\\\"plans in support of these renamings to conduct a number of actions in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Kazan as well as in Makhachkala. \\\\\"I consider,\\\\\" the mufti says, \\\\\"that the stable development of society will be secured not only by the economic growth of the country but also by the good-neighborly coexistence of various cultures and religions\\\\\" that such renamings will both symbolize and promote.\\\\\" It very much remains to be seen if Russian Orthodox nationalists will agree with that.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Moscow City Residents Getting Two-Thirds of All Russian Funds for Social Improvements, Zubarevich Says\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 31 - Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev professed shock to learn that 2700 schools in rural Russia don\\'t have indoor toilets; but he shouldn\\'t have been, Natalya Zubarevich says, because under Putin, Muscovites, although forming less than 10 percent of the Russian population, get two-thirds of all government funds for social improvements. Not surprisingly, this outrages many outside of Moscow because they cannot afford even a small fraction of what the capital\\'s residents now expect as their due, the specialist on regional development says (newizv.ru\\\\/interview\\\\/30-08-2017\\\\/natalya-zubarevich-moskva-nikak-ne-mozhet-byt-primerom-dlya-regionov-e0ac081d-13d9-48e9-8f6b-7ebe72a6f71a). The government spends 150,000 rubles for each Muscovite while in Samara it spends only 12,000, in Volgograd, only 16,000, and in Voronezh, only 15,000. As one can see, Zubarevich says, \\\\\"the difference is not simply in percent but in order of magnitude!\\\\\" And people are taking notice. The problem is that the Russian government takes so much from the regions that they have nothing left but gives back to Moscow far more than its share. At present, the central government takes 75 percent of the taxes people in Omsk pay. If it took only five percent, that city would be able to solve almost all its problems. Muscovites say they deserve the money spent on them but that is based on a misconception. Pointing to their budget surplus, they forget that almost all Russian companies are registered in and pay taxes in the capital city rather than where they actually earn their money and should pay taxes. Even in Imperial Russia, things were concentrated in the capital city, Zubarevich continues; but there was an important difference. The wealth of that country was generated by agriculture which by its nature was more decentralized than wealth now from the extraction and sale of oil and gas, the only things Russia is competitive in internationally. One reason that the authorities are spending so much money on renovations in Moscow is the power of the construction industry, she continues. That industry, despite its power, has taken a huge hit in the last 18 months. It saw its production fall by 14 percent in 2016 and by 40 percent in the first half of this year alone. Obviously, the powers that be have to take that sector\\'s needs into consideration; but for the country as a whole, things can get better if and only if there is serious decentralization of power and decision making. That won\\'t be achieved by moving the capital as the case of Kazakhstan shows. Indeed, shifting the capital could end by making things more centralized. \\\\\"The capital functions of Moscow will be reduced only when the super-centralizstion of the system of administration is reduced,\\\\\" she says. Perhaps what is needed is to have many capitals, \\\\\"an aluminum capital, a metallurgical capital,\\\\\" and so on, although that isn\\'t enough for modernization. Repression won\\'t solve Russia\\'s problems as the situation in China shows; only decentralization of power can do that. But moving in that direction will be hard given Russia\\'s traditions and its paternalistic belief that the center knows best and should be able to impose its will everywhere on all things. Despite that and despite the existence of paternalistic attitudes even among Muscovites, the portion of the population most educated and most aware of the problems Russia faces and thus the part the Kremlin is careful to take the best care of lest if face massive protests, Zubarevich argues, the trend toward modernization via decentralization is \\\\\"unstoppable.\\\\\" There will be periods of retreat as well as progress, and it will remain true that \\\\\"in Russia, one must life a long time in order to see changes; but they will occur! [Indeed,] the entire 21st century in Russia will be seriously turbulent.\\\\\" It won\\'t be \\\\\"stable,\\\\\" despite what some imagine, \\\\\"but the vector of modernization\\\\\" away from centralization will win out in the end.\\\\n\\\\n\\'That Awkward Moment\\': Putin Cited Debunked MH17 Claims In Oliver Stone Interview\\\\n\\\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, it seems, didn&rsquo;t get the memo -- or just doesn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; A purported &quot;Spanish air-traffic controller&quot; at a Kyiv airport was exposed as ...\\\\n\\\\nFSB Officer Called To Testify At Former Russian Economy Minister\\'s Trial\\\\n\\\\nA Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) general accused by former Economic Development Minister Aleksei Ulyukayev of helping set him up for a bribery charge has been called to testify for th...\\\\n\\\\nRussian Ex-Minister\\'s Bribery Trial Starts In Moscow\\\\n\\\\nA Russian court opened the bribery trial of former Economic Development Minister Aleksei Ulyukaev -- the highest-ranking government official to be arrested on corruption charges since the Stalin era.

This year is the 25th anniversary of the solemn oath of allegiance to Belarus, which Belarusian officers took. A public civil action was prepared by the Belarusian Association of the Military. The solemn event was timed to the Day of the Belarusian Military Glory, which is celebrated on the day of the victory of the troops of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the Battle of Orsha. Back then, Kanstantsin Astrozhski defeated the army of Muscovites, which was three times bigger. The Belarusian National Congress launched an initiative to take the Oath of Freedom at 7 p.m. on September 8 in the Kastrychnitskaya Square in Minsk. The BNC Council offered the following text of the oath: I... before God and Belarus: Swear to fight for the freedom and independence of my country; Swear to cherish Belarus in my heart, and defend it from any enemy wherever they might come from; Swear to be faithful to Belarus and never to betray my friends, who are struggling for the free Homeland. Long Live Belarus! The website charter97.org asked the direct participant of those events, retired Major of the Belarusian army Ales Stankevich what the main goal of that action was, what the Belarusian officers felt while taking that oath, and why it is so important for the Belarusian patriots to take the Oath of Freedom. -- Young soldiers at that time had already taken an oath, the text of which was approved by the Supreme Council, and the commanders remained under the oath of the USSR. This was very dangerous, since in the event of a military conflict, they were not even obliged to fight for Belarus. The Belarusian Association of the Military and the Belarusian Popular Front starting raising this issue in the society. On September 8, on the Day of Belarusian Military Glory, the anniversary of the victory of the troops of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania over Muscovy, we took this oath. Thousands of people gathered in the Independence Square. People specially came to this event from other cities of Belarus: many officers, sergeants, privates, reserve soldiers. On the stage, 12 officers -- members of the leadership of the Interior Ministry -- took the oath, in parade uniform. Mikalai Statkevich was the first to take the oath, after the text was signed by the military, who were there. Our main goal was the creation of a popular army. I fully support the initiative of the Belarusian National Congress to take the oath of allegiance to Belarus. People should be reminded of patriotism and love for their country.\\\\n\\\\nTransnistria \\\\/ Moldova Reports\\\\n\\\\nRussian minister criticizes Moldova\\'s call for troop pullout - ABC News\\\\n\\\\nRussian minister criticizes Moldova\\'s call for troop pullout\\\\n\\\\nTASS: Russian Politics & Diplomacy - Russia does not want war and is not going to participate in it -- Lavrov\\\\n\\\\nThe top diplomat stressed that Russia\\'s main fortune is its people\\\\n\\\\nUAWire - Transnistria protests Chisinau\\'s deportation of Russian delegation\\\\n\\\\nDiplomats of the unrecognized Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic accused the Moldovan authorities of deporting delegation members from Russia and South Ossetia who were traveling to Transnistria, as reported on the official site of the Transnistrian Foreign Ministry. \\\\\"The actions of the representatives of the Republic of Moldova are evidence of yet another cycle of Chi\\\\u0219in\\\\u0103u\\'s use of mechanisms to filter foreign guests heading for Transnistria,\\\\\" the statement reads.

Next year, the same grand jubilees will be marked in Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, and Latvia, which all emerged on the ruins of the Russian Empire. Ukraine, on the contrary, has just observed its 26th Independence Day, though in January 1918 the sovereignty of the Ukrainian People\\'s Republic (known after the acronym UNR) was proclaimed in Kyiv. After World War I, the nascent Ukrainian state, which also tried to break away with the empire, did not manage to withstand several waves of the Russian Bolshevik invasion. Since 1920, most of today\\'s Ukraine fell under Soviet rule for nearly seven decades, excluding western Ukrainian lands, which were incorporated into the Soviet Union later, during the Second World War. The failure of the Ukrainian revolutionary statehood of 1917-21 was connected to a large extent with the fierce internal collisions of various social and political forces, the strength of invading Red troops, and the crucial role of Ukraine in the Bolshevik economic and geopolitical strategy. However, one more major factor was the lack of recognition and real support of Ukraine on the part of the victorious powers in the wake of WWI. While the United States and the Entente (France and Britain) proclaimed the emancipation of enslaved nations as their chief political goal at war and during the peace talks, their program was not implemented fairly and systematically. The Western leaders solemnly declared that an independent Poland was a necessary condition \\\\\"of a solid and just peace, and of the regime of right in Europe.\\\\\"[1] After the war, French Prime Minister and head of the Paris Peace Conference Georges Clemenceau was immensely proud of restoring the Polish state, whose partition by Russia, Austria, and Prussia in the 18th century he labeled no less than \\\\\"the greatest crime in history.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOleg Deripaska\\'s Rusal hits back at Ukraine\\'s SBU - Aluminium Insider : Aluminium Insider\\\\n\\\\nRussian aluminium giant U.C. Rusal hit back at the Security Service of Ukraine after the SBU accused some of the company\\'s representatives in the country of deliberately destroying the Zaporozhye Aluminium Smelter (ZALK) and causing damages of over $39 million as a result of their actions. \\\\\"The company views those illegal actions as an attempt to retaliate and put political pressure over a lawsuit against the government of Ukraine filed by Rusal to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID),\\\\\" a company spokesperson said. The smelter at the center of the tiff, ZALK, which is Ukraine\\'s sole aluminium plant, was expropriated by the state in 2015 when its shares were transferred from a Rusal subsidiary to the State Property Fund of Ukraine. Rusal initiated proceedings shortly thereafter at the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes seeking the return of its stake in ZALK, plus costs and interest. Results of the request for arbitration are pending. However, according to Alexander Okhrimenko, a Ukrainian political analyst and president of the Ukrainian Analytical Center, ZALK was set up as part of the USSR\\'s industrial system and would not be able to function outside the Russian value chain. The plot further thickened in the fall of 2016, when President Petro Poroshenko levied sanctions upon the Russian firm, alleging it of undermining the country\\'s national security. The presidential decree gave Ukrainian authorities the right to freeze Rusal\\'s assets and block its economic actions within the country. It also prohibits the firm from removing capital, bidding on government contracts, and engaging in share transactions. Rusal was one of three hundred other Russian businesses and citizens that were ultimately subjected to restrictions placed upon it by the current Ukrainian leadership since 2014. Although the government\\'s 2016 decree failed to outline precisely how Rusal may have been threatening the government, Rusal indicated at the time that the sanctions were imposed in retaliation to the simmering ZALK dispute. It is unclear at this point what the fate of Rusal\\'s other asset in Ukraine, the Nikolaev Alumina Refinery (NGZ), will be. The Russian company bought a 30 percent share of the plant in 2000, and invested US$430 million in order to increase the 68-year-old plant\\'s capacity by 700 thousand metric tons per annum. Energy consumption was slashed by one-fifth, largely via converting to automation a significant portion of the smelting process. All in, the operations at NGZ now process between 4 and 5 million tons of bauxite each year, a small share of which was used by ZALK before it was expropriated by the Ukrainian state, with the rest going to other Russian smelters due to differences in production standards that make its output incompatible with European smelters.\\\\n\\\\nSaakashvili Says His Brother Detained In Kyiv\\\\n\\\\nFormer Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who is also a former governor of Ukraine\\'s Odesa region, says his brother David has been detained in Kyiv.

When in the spring of 2016, the head of the Donetsk regional military-civilian administration Pavel Zhebrivsky announced about the reconstruction of the airport in Mariupol, which was going to spend 60 million hryvnia and make it for half a year, many were wondering why the city, the airspace over which is closed and in what is the red level of the terrorist threat of opening the flight? It was said that this would improve the situation with civilian transport, however, fighting in the southern direction is unlikely to contribute to this. Subsequently, the mayor of the city of Boychenko voiced an amount of 70 million hryvnia and called the plans for reconstruction in three stages. In the winter of 2017, they spoke about her again, and recently the patriarch of the mayor of Mariupol, Alexander Goltvenko, during a meeting with the Lithuanian delegation, declared readiness to resume the work of the city airport. According to the official, the city authorities can easily restore the airport, but the opening of airspace over the city is a political issue that should be solved at the state level. In general, Mariupol presented the National Transport Strategy of Ukraine in 2030. Mayor Boychenko proposed for the city\\'s successful development the following tasks: to repair the Zaporozhye-Mariupol route, increase the throughput capacity on the Komish-Zorya-Volnovak section, to make passenger transportation more comfortable, to open the airport, to let Intercity . If you return to the airport, the Deputy Mayor Goltvenko is sure that the militants will not be able to fire him because of the height of the heights, so the local authorities consider the yard to be safe. And his work will solve the problem of transport, because the city through the \\\\\"narrow neck\\\\\" can not skip the required number of trains. Of course, if you look at the line of demarcation and the territory from where the militants regularly bombard the forces of the Armed Forces, which are Sahanka, Bezimenna, Azov, and so on, then \\\\\"Grad\\\\\" is quite realistic to get to the airport. How sophisticated is the question of professionals. Range of shooting \\\\\"Grad\\\\\" - 40 km. It is just the distance to the Sakhalin flight, from which, in 2015, there was flown by the city, Vostochny microdistrict. In addition, the terrorists often bombard the suburb of Mariupol - Sartan. However, in addition to the threat to the airport itself, there will be at risk the planes that will theoretically approach the landing. It is known that before the landing, the liner is maneuvering over the Granite with a sharp drop in height. Granite, it should be recalled, under the control of militants \\\\\"DPR\\\\\". And the plane will become an easy target for the enemy. We will have to break the head of the professionals in the field of aviation, how to change the route and reduce the danger if the airport is still open. Despite the fact that the fighters, and most importantly Russia, are very unprofitable to shoot down airplanes in today\\'s conditions, when the aggressor is already sanctioned and for such actions their strengthening will be inevitable, yet we should not forget about the downfall in the summer of 2014 in the area of Snezhnoe \\\\\"Buk\\\\\" Boeing B-777-200ER, flying Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur. In fact, civilian planes, like the airliner, will be under constant threat of possible shelling. Therefore, the question of how expedient it is to open an airport in terms of civilian flights will remain open for a long time. And people who even have the opportunity to buy tickets to the plane, will have to drink in trains (from Kiev to Mariupol to go 18 hours by train), or ride motor transport through Berdyansk and more. Since the desire of some to demonstrate that there is no real threat to the city from the side of the militants, it can cost too much if diplomatic fuses do not work. Because only thanks to them Mariupol is not Avdeevka, which is regularly fired. On the other hand, the airport may well serve for military purposes. First, there are still military. Secondly, in 2014, the Mariupol airfield together with Kramatorsk and Siverskodonetsk became the key points for the defense of the Ukrainian Army in the respective directions. Even when Mariupol was temporarily occupied by the \\\\\"DNR\\\\\", our military was stationed at the airport and it was from the airport that the liberation of the city began. The active use of the airport can increase mobility and strengthen the group of Ukrainian Army in Primorye, as well as enable the rapid transport of wounded soldiers, respectively, increasing the number of saved lives. It is clear that the restored airport will be able to accept at least An-26, not to mention the large IL-76 ... For military, its reconstruction and use will be of strategic importance.\\\\n\\\\nThe Previously Mothballed Tor Was Observed in the ATO Zone\\\\n\\\\nPosted by Admin On August 31, 2017 With the commencement of hostilities in the Donbass region in order to confront the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, our country removed many military equipment for the stock of newly formed military units from storage, and, among other things, the Armed Forces received super-powerful 2S7 \\\\\"Pion\\\\\" artillery systems with a 203 mm caliber capable of destroying targets on distance of almost 50 km. In the course of the exhibition of military equipment \\\\\"The Might of the Undefeated \\\\\" in Kyiv, on the Independence Square, the SAM \\\\\"Tor\\\\\" was demonstrated, which in the 90\\'s was armed with the Armed Forces of Ukraine and, for a number of reasons, was withdrawn from their warehouses and put into storage. About this, at the exhibition, the military revealed some details about these machines, in particular, that this sample has not been restored to show at the exhibition, and some of the complexes are already in combat duty. This information was confirmed by the OSCE, which in a report released yesterday from its UAV noted these complexes in the area of military operation in the Donbass: On August 24, an average range of UAV UAV recorded 5 anti-aircraft missile systems (two 9K330 Tor and three 9K33 Osa) near. Kasyanivka (81 km south of Donetsk) and one anti-aircraft missile complex (9K35 Strela-10) near Kremenivka. (This is the first case when the Mission reports the presence of \\\\\"Tor\\\\\" anti-aircraft missile complexes). As for the total number of complexes in the Armed Forces, there is no open information yet, but it is now known that trial firings have already been made of them, during which their tactical and technical characteristics have been confirmed. So far, the level of modernization of the complex and its missiles remains unknown. As you know, in Ukraine, OPK companies have already mastered the maintenance of missiles to the S-300 complex, firing of which was recently conducted in Bulgaria. ZRK \\\\\"Tor\\\\\" (the index of GRU - 9\\\\u041a330) - an anti-aircraft missile system designed to solve the tasks of anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense at the level of the division\\'s level. Provides protection against targets moving at speeds up to 700 m \\\\/ s, at a distance of 0.5 to 12 km and at altitudes from 10 m to 6 km. Transfer from the original to a combat position lasts up to 3 minutes. The reaction time of the complex is 8-12 seconds\\\\n\\\\nUkraine may repair and return TOR self-propelled missile system to service | Defence Blog\\\\n\\\\nThe Ministry of Defence of Ukraine is planning to bring back into service some of its mothballed TOR all-weather, short-range surface-to-air missile systems and to update them. The first repaired 9K330 Tor self-propelled air defence system was displayed during the \\\\\"Might of the Undefeated\\\\\" arms exhibition in Kyiv on August 24. Early, the Ukrainian 9K330 missile systems were in service at least until 2001 but later were removed from service because of the inability to keep in working order. According to a source in the country\\'s defence industry, the State enterprise \\\\\"Lviv Radio Repair Plant\\\\\" has been selected for repair and overhaul work on 9K330 Tor air defence system. All information on this project is kept secret. The State enterprise \\\\\"Lviv Radio Repair Plant\\\\\" is part of the Ukroboronprom and it is the plant for repair and overhaul work on the radar location stations of air target reconnaissance (P-18, PRV-16, PRV-13, NRZ-4P, NRZ-6P, AGU P-14, AGU 5N84A, radar station of air defense systems S-125, S-75). The 9K330 Tor is commonly known by its NATO reporting name, SA-15 \\\\\"Gauntlet\\\\\". The Tor self-propelled missile system is especially designed to protect the most important military and civil objects from air strikes carried out using aircraft, helicopters, cruising missiles, guided missiles, aerial guided and non-guided bombs, UAVs, etc. under any lighting and weather conditions. The 9K330 Tor air defence missile system is armed with 8 surface-to-air guided missiles. The missile\\'s high-explosive fragmentation warhead and an active proximity fuse allow it to destroy targets moving at speeds of 700m\\\\/s and altitudes of 6,000m, within a range of 12km. The anti-aircraft missile system is based on a GM-355 tracked combat vehicle, which can travel at a road speed of approximately 65km\\\\/h for a range of 500km.

He wrote this in an article on the eve of the BRICS summit, which will be held in Xiamen on September 4-5. The article was published on the Kremlin\\'s website. \\\\\"I cannot ignore the situation on the Korean Peninsula, which has recently escalated and is teetering on the edge of a large-scale conflict,\\\\\" said the Russian president. Putin stressed that, in Russia\\'s opinion, the notion that it is possible to stop North Korea\\'s nuclear missile program solely by putting pressure on Pyongyang \\\\\"is erroneous and unlikely to yield results.\\\\\" According to him, it is possible to solve the problems in the region through direct dialogue that involves all interested parties and without setting preliminary conditions. \\\\\"Provocation, pressure, and combative and insulting rhetoric is the way to nowhere,\\\\\" the Russian leader said. On the night of August 29, North Korea launched a ballistic missile in the direction of Japan. It flew over the territory of the country and crashed into the waters of the Pacific Ocean. The missile traveled a distance of 2,700 kilometers and reached a maximum flight altitude of 550 kilometers.

By and large this consensus still centers on the same policy tools it has for the past dozen years: economic sanctions capable of coercing Pyongyang into capitulating to US and UN demands that it end its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Sanctions are clearly preferable to war, but they do not offer a viable strategy for untying the Gordian Knot that is North Korea. Those advocating the \\\\\"get tough with sanctions\\\\\" approach to the North Korean nuclear and missile problem in turn base their approach on two dubious assumptions.[1] First, they believe that there is a great deal of additional economic pressure that can be put on North Korea. Some who share this assumption believe the US has a number of unilateral tools that could achieve US objectives. Others -- like President Trump -- believe that China holds the key by threatening economic pressure on Pyongyang and that China can be persuaded or coerced into using its leverage on Kim Jong Un. Second, advocates of this approach believe that this additional pressure will likely produce a positive result: North Korean capitulation to US demands or -- failing that -- a change of regime in the DPRK. Those who believe sanctions are the answer to the North Korean problem point in particular to the sanctions regime developed against Iran\\'s nuclear program. They assert that sanctions on Iran were more severe than they are today on North Korea. They add that when the international community got serious about sanctions on Iranian oil and Iranian oil revenue, the regime became serious at the P5+1 negotiations. Thus, if only the US and China would get as serious about sanctions on North Korea, Pyongyang would be faced with the choice of collapse or agreement to end its nuclear and missile adventure.\\\\n\\\\nTrump\\'s terrible options on North Korea\\\\n\\\\nThe only prudent option is to deter North Korea, which already has nuclear weapons, just as Washington did with the Soviet Union and China (far more powerful and dangerous adversaries) during the Cold War and continues to do today. Kim is a sociopath, a brute, a murderer, a war criminal, a narcissist obsessed with his own sense of glory, but there isn\\'t any evidence he is suicidal. The fear among the North Korean elite of getting annihilated by U.S. military power would preclude an unprovoked nuclear attack. Hopefully, this is what Trump means when he says \\\\\"talking is not the answer.\\\\\" Hopefully, this is code for \\\\\"we are switching gears toward containment.\\\\\" Because the other interpretation would mean a lot of dead Koreans, Japanese, and Americans, the destruction of the world\\'s 11th largest economy (South Korea), and a conflict that would be so violent that it would make the last decade of war look like a minor traffic stop. The U.S. policy of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula went out the window as soon as Pyongyang exploded its first nuclear device in 2006. Eleven years later, North Korea boasts at least 20-25 nuclear warheads. For the U.S., two policies remain: preventive war, which is immoral and would cost far too much, or deterrence, which has worked against every nuclear-armed country since scientists discovered how to split the atom. Deterrence is the only policy which will protect American security at an acceptable cost.\\\\n\\\\nRobert Robb | North Korea has nuclear weapons.

Moon\\'s phone call with Trump began at 11:10 pm on Sept. 1 and lasted for about 40 minutes, according to Blue House spokesperson Park Soo-hyun. During the phone call, the two leaders discussed how the North Korea\\'s recent missile provocations had affected the security situation on the Korean Peninsula and how to respond to those provocations.

The North Koreans wouldn\\'t be the first to miscalculate what suicidal is. It was suicidal for the Japanese to attack the Americans and British in 1941, in retrospect, at least. But at the time, it seemed like a reasonable idea. It was suicidal for Hitler to attack Russia, especially when over half the German invasion force\\'s transport was horse-drawn. But at the time it didn\\'t seem so. The United States invading Iraq without a plan for what to do once Baghdad was captured?

(Nick Otto Special to the Chronicle) SF consulate closure another obstacle for Russian entrepreneurs Visitors with an appointment come to the Russian consulate for passport related issues on Wednesday, August 30, 2017, in San Francisco, Calif., as the Russian consulate will be closing tomorrow. Russian officials pledge tough, measured answer to US order The result is that U.S.-Russian relations have deteriorated markedly despite, and in some respects because of, Trump\\'s grotesque admiration for a man who has declared war on Ukrainian sovereignty and American democracy alike. Signals that the administration might make undue concessions to Russia, for example, led Congress to pass a measure stepping up sanctions against the country and limiting the president\\'s ability to soften them. Facing a veto-proof mandate, Trump reluctantly signed it while grousing that it was \\\\\"seriously flawed.\\\\\" Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Putin\\'s sometime seat-warmer, took the opportunity to ridicule Trump for having \\\\\"demonstrated complete impotence in the most humiliating manner.\\\\\" As if to prove the point, Trump went on to impotently thank Putin for forcing a retaliatory two-thirds cut to American diplomatic staff in Russia, while insulting U.S. employees by saying he was \\\\\"trying to cut down our payroll.\\\\\" Thursday\\'s State Department order to close the San Francisco consulate and two other facilities by Saturday was a more potent response. But the administration did not force staff reductions and hoped to \\\\\"avoid further retaliatory actions by both sides and move forward to achieve the stated goal of both of our presidents: improved relations.\\\\\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday blamed souring relations on the Obama administration, which in December closed two East Coast Russian compounds in response to Moscow\\'s election meddling. A few months later, the Russians\\' preferred candidate explored returning the facilities.

Kenya is notorious for corruption, and virtually all prior elections had been marred by rigging. This time, however, the US and Kenya\\'s other donors had\\\\n\\\\ninvested $24 million in an electronic vote-tallying system designed to prevent interference. When Kenya\\'s electoral commission announced on August 11 that President Uhuru Kenyatta had won another five-year term with over 54 percent of the vote, observer teams from the African Union, the European Union, and the highly respected US-based Carter Center, led by former Secretary of State John Kerry, commended the electoral process and said they\\'d seen no evidence of significant fraud. Congratulations poured in from around the world and Donald Trump praised the elections as fair and transparent.\\\\n\\\\nBut not everyone was happy. Raila Odinga, leader of the opposition National Super Alliance party, or NASA, declared the election a sham as soon as the results began coming in. On August 18, he submitted a petition asking Kenya\\'s Supreme Court to annul it and order a re-vote. The petition claims, among other things, that nearly half of all votes cast had been tampered with; that NASA\\'s agents, who were entitled by law to observe the voting and counting, had been thrown out of polling stations in Kenyatta strongholds; and that secret, unofficial polling stations had transmitted fake votes. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on September 1, but on August 29, the court registrar reported that some 5 million votes, enough to affect the outcome, were not verified.\\\\n\\\\nSigns that something weird was going on emerged well before the election. A month earlier, Kenya\\'s electoral commission contracted Ghurair, a Dubai publishing firm, to print ballots. Newspaper reports linked the company to Kenyatta\\'s inner circle, and Kenyan courts ordered the electoral commission to use a different firm. The order was ignored, and the electoral commission issued a single-source contract to Ghurair anyway, citing time pressure. Then the accounting firm KPMG reported that more than a million dead people might still be registered as voters. NASA officials complained that Ghurair could print extra ballots to be used to create pro-Kenyatta ghost votes. Kerry dismissed these concerns,\\\\n\\\\nquipping after the election, \\\\\"The people who voted were alive. I didn\\'t see any dead people walking around.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nTen days before the election, the brutally tortured corpse of the electoral commission\\'s IT manager, Chris Msando, was discovered in some bushes outside Nairobi. CCTV footage shows his car roaming around the city for hours in the middle of the night before he died. Also in the car were two men and a woman, whose dead body was discovered beside Msanado\\'s, suggesting a \\\\\"love triangle\\\\\" explanation. Many Kenyans expressed skepticism. Msando managed the electronic system for transmitting results from polling stations, and he\\'d been complaining to the police of death threats for weeks. Kenya\\'s donors, including the EU\\'s ambassador to Kenya, praised the government for its commitment to investigating the murders, though many Kenyans suspected the police of being involved in them. But when the US and UK offered to help with the investigation, the police declined. Kerry warned the opposition not to politicize the killing.\\\\n\\\\nA week before the election, a team of US and Canadian advisers who had been helping Odinga\\'s campaign set up a parallel system to verify the vote counting were\\\\n\\\\narrested at gunpoint and deported. Then Odinga\\'s spokesman fled too, citing death threats. Then the NASA vote-counting office was ransacked. The Carter Center noted in its report that the raid had probably been carried out by Kenyan security personnel.\\\\n\\\\nElection day brought more problems. According to Kenya\\'s electoral laws, representatives from all political parties are permitted to witness the voting and the counting of ballots in polling stations after polls close. Each representative then signs a form known as 34A, certifying the count, and receives a carbon copy. The new $24 million system was supposed to enable scans of the 34A forms to be sent to the electoral commission and posted online immediately, so they could be double checked by all parties and the public. But that system broke down at polling stations all across the country, so only the numbers were sent to Nairobi, often not by the new system but by text message. NASA officials pointed out that these numbers could have been changed en route and noted various suspicious findings in the unofficial early returns, including 100 percent voter turnout at some polling stations -- with all votes for Kenyatta; a consistent 11 percent spread between Odinga and Kenyatta during the vote counting -- a virtual statistical impossibility; and a phenomenon known as \\\\\"unvoting,\\\\\" in which the totals for some candidates actually fell as more votes came in. In his remarks on behalf of the Carter Center, Kerry admitted that there had been some \\\\\"little aberrations here and there,\\\\\" but none that \\\\\"we thus far feel affected the overall integrity of the process.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nElectoral commission officials were supposed to deliver their 34A copies to one of 290 constituency-level centers, where the totals would be recorded on forms known as 34Bs. Copies of all 34As and 34Bs were then supposed to be delivered physically to the national tally center in Nairobi, where they were to be put online -- if they had not been already. But almost none were actually online on the day Kenyatta was declared the winner.\\\\n\\\\nShortly before departing Kenya, John Kerry praised the electoral commission for having done an \\\\\"extraordinary job to ensure that Kenya has a free, fair and credible poll.\\\\\" He then urged the opposition to \\\\\"get over it and move on.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe Kenyan Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) preparing to announce election results, Nairobi, Kenya, August 11, 2017\\\\n\\\\nPeople who have witnessed election fraud in other African countries have told me that it\\'s normally done by making small changes to large numbers of tallies and this appears to have happened in Kenya, where there were over 40,000 polling stations. After NASA submitted its petition, a team of American experts led by University of Michigan Professor of Statistics and Political Science Walter Mebane volunteered to conduct a forensic analysis of the results. Results that have been tampered with show patterns and Mebane\\'s computer program identified over half a million fraudulent votes in this manner -- almost certainly an underestimate of the true number.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Mebane, the paper forms provide the true test of the integrity of the election. The Supreme Court\\'s registrar assembled a team of experts to physically examine the 34A and B forms that the electoral commission claimed to have used to arrive at the final results. According to their analysis, nearly a third of the forms have irregularities: some are blank, some are signed in the same handwriting, some come from polling stations that didn\\'t officially exist, some show results that differed from the totals on the copies of the form in NASA\\'s possession and from the totals announced by the electoral commission, and thousands lack official stamps, signatures, and watermarks. When the Supreme Court-appointed team examined the logs of the electoral commission\\'s server, it found that numerous unauthorized users had entered the system before and after the election, that the electoral commission chairman had uploaded and removed 34A forms, and that some polling center results had been added before the election had actually occurred.\\\\n\\\\nDespite the growing evidence that the election was a fraud, Kenya\\'s notoriously corrupt judiciary may dismiss the case. When Odinga disputed Kenyatta\\'s victory after a similarly flawed election in 2013, the justices ruled that the election should stand, even though results from much of the country are not available even now, and probably never will be.\\\\n\\\\nAnother rigged election in Africa is not news. But that US election observers were so quick to endorse it is shocking. Perhaps they believed that wrapping the election up quickly would prevent violence. After Kenya\\'s 2007 election, which most observers have since concluded was rigged against Odinga, some of his supporters went on a looting and killing spree in ruling-party strongholds. Gangs backed by ruling-party officials fought back and the ensuing mayhem left more than a thousand people dead, caused hundreds of thousands to flee their homes, and nearly shut down the economy of much of eastern Africa, which relies on transport from the Kenyan coast. Members of Odinga\\'s coalition were quoted making ethnically charged statements, but it was Kenyatta and his current deputy, William Ruto -- who was then allied with Odinga, but has since switched sides -- who were charged by the International Criminal Court with crimes against humanity for organizing and supporting the violent gangs. (The cases against them collapsed after witnesses were intimidated or died under mysterious circumstances.)\\\\n\\\\nIf the observers think urging Odinga to \\\\\"move on\\\\\" will avoid a rerun of 2007, they are likely mistaken. The Bush White House\\'s rush to congratulate Odinga\\'s rival, Mwai Kibaki, after the rigged 2007 election helped\\\\n\\\\nfuel the violence that followed.\\\\n\\\\nA far more troubling possibility is that the US wants Kenyatta to remain in power, at the expense of democracy. Kenya lies in one of the most volatile regions of the world. Its neighbor Somalia has been a war zone for a decade; conflict in South Sudan has sent more than two million refugees scrambling to neighboring countries, including Kenya, since 2013. Two of Kenya\\'s other neighbors, Uganda and Ethiopia, are ruled by US-backed autocrats who have instigated or worsened these conflicts. Ethiopia\\'s US-assisted invasion of Somalia in 2006 set off the mayhem there, promoting the rise of the Islamist terrorist group Al-Shabaab. In 2014, Uganda entered the South Sudan civil war on the government\\'s side. Humanitarian organizations called for an arms embargo, which would have made Uganda\\'s involvement illegal. The UN Security Council, including Russia and China, seemed open to an embargo, but the Obama did not pursue it.\\\\n\\\\nKenyatta, a drowsy-looking bon vivant and the son of Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya\\'s first post-independence president, is supported by a powerful network of Kenyan politicians and businessmen, mostly of Kikuyu ethnicity, who have been looting the country for decades. He has aligned Kenya with US policy by, for example, deploying Kenyan forces in AMISOM, the US- and UK-supported African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia.\\\\n\\\\nOdinga, a taciturn, ambitious seventy-two-year-old of Luo ethnicity, whose father was Jomo Kenyatta\\'s post-independence vice-president and later his rival, has long nursed a grudge against Kenyatta\\'s Kikuyu elite. He spent ten years in jail for participating in a failed coup against Jomo Kenyatta\\'s hand-picked successor, Daniel Arap Moi, in 1982 and he fought vigorously for Kenya\\'s progressive 2010 Constitution which weakened Kenya\\'s formerly all- powerful presidency and made local officials more accountable to their people. Odinga has pledged to deliver a plan to withdraw Kenya\\'s troops from Somalia in the first ninety days of his presidency. NASA officials point out that the AMISOM deployment has provoked terrorist attacks on a Nairobi shopping mall and a university, killing hundreds and devastating Kenya\\'s tourist industry. Odinga is also close to South Sudan\\'s beleaguered opposition, and might help force the US-backed government into negotiations. This is something the Obama administration seems not to have wanted, and the Trump administration seems not to either.\\\\n\\\\nOpposition leader Raila Odinga greeting supporters, Nairobi, Kenya, August 13, 2017\\\\n\\\\nWhen I asked a member of the Carter Center delegation why his team was so confident about Kenyatta\\'s victory, he sent me a six-page report by a US-funded Kenyan NGO called the Election Observer Group. It describes a \\\\\"verification\\\\\" survey of the presidential results from 1,703 randomly selected polling stations around the country. According to the report, the survey predicted the electoral commission\\'s final results to within 0.3 percentage points for all eight candidates, including very minor ones who\\'d received only a few thousand votes.\\\\n\\\\nIt was obvious at once that something wasn\\'t right with this report. The NGO\\'s projected results were suspiciously accurate and the authors neglected to describe their sampling strategy. The sampling strategy is crucial -- after all, voter preferences are not randomly spread around the country but clustered, with Kenyatta\\'s supporters in some regions and Odinga\\'s in others. A spokesman for the NGO told me that the survey was carefully stratified, but after carrying out a similar \\\\\"verification\\\\\" study during Kenya\\'s 2013 election, the same NGO declined requests to share its methodology until months after the contested vote, and when it did, several polling stations in the planned sample were reportedly missing.\\\\n\\\\nA statistician friend who looked over the report for me put it this way: \\\\\"Working backwards, from a known... or desired... election outcome, even I would know how to choose 1,700 polling stations to make results work. You would simply toss into the hopper Kikuyu area polling stations or remove Luo stations as needed.\\\\\" Kikuyus tend to support Kenyatta; Luos, Odinga.\\\\n\\\\nThe Carter Center official was sanguine: \\\\\"This [report] makes it highly unlikely that a large scale systematic manipulation -- digital or manual -- occurred during tabulation,\\\\\" he wrote me. \\\\\"Any significant discrepancies would have been discovered in the parallel count.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBut the study he was touting seemed to me like a piece of fake news -- a flood of which had poured into Kenya around the election, virtually all pro-Kenyatta and\\\\/or anti-Odinga. Reports that Odinga had killed white farmers and that American think tanks believed Kenyatta would win appeared on newly created, convincing-looking blogs like \\\\\"Foreign Policy Journal\\\\\" and on mock-ups resembling Kenya\\'s largest daily, The Nation. While cooked-up stories about celebrities and UFOs are common in Africa, partisan fake news like this is not.\\\\n\\\\nDays before the election, an official-looking document -- that may or may not be genuine -- was leaked to an opposition member of parliament. It described plans to deploy \\\\\"regime friendly\\\\\" soldiers to two of Nairobi\\'s largest slums, both packed with Odinga supporters. In case the people rose up after the results were announced, these men were to cut off the water and electricity supplies and block access to the city center.\\\\n\\\\nA few days after the election, an obviously fake \\\\\"Embassy cable\\\\\" began circulating on Whatsapp, complete with US government heading and transmission codes. The unsigned author, addressing his or herself to the \\\\\"Secretary of State,\\\\\" predicted that if Odinga won the election, his tribesmen would be so happy they\\'d go on a rampage for months, looting and pillaging and destabilizing eastern Africa. While the predictions in the document are absurd, they reflect what many Kenyans probably think Americans think of them, and seemed designed to demoralize those Kenyans who have long suspected a US hand in the rigging of their elections.\\\\n\\\\nLast spring, Kenyatta\\'s party hired, for a reported $6 million, the data research firm Cambridge Analytica, which helped elect Donald Trump and sway Britain\\'s Brexit vote. Cambridge Analytica\\'s parent company is Strategic Communications Limited, which is now working for the State Department. Articles in Slate and Politico suggest that SCL has in the past engaged in disinformation campaigns to sway elections in developing countries. The company denies this.\\\\n\\\\nThe most disturbing article concerning the Kenyan election appeared on the New York Times editorial page two days after the results were announced. Entitled \\\\\"The Real Suspense in Kenya,\\\\\" the editorial claimed that election observers had \\\\\"witnessed no foul play,\\\\\" even though the Carter Center\\'s report, in contrast to the observer\\'s public statements, mentions Msando\\'s killing, the NASA office raid, and the problems with the transmission of results.\\\\n\\\\nThe editorial also accused Odinga of \\\\\"fann[ing] the embers of ethnic strife,\\\\\" when he\\'d actually urged his supporters to remain calm. NASA considered organizing a nonviolent protest -- permitted under Kenyan law -- but deemed it too dangerous. There was spontaneous protesting and some sporadic looting in Odinga strongholds after Kenyatta\\'s victory was announced, but according to human rights groups, there is no evidence that this was organized, or that Odinga or NASA had anything to do with it. As the Times editors should have known, there was election-related violence, but virtually all of it was carried out by government security forces. For days after the results were announced, special police units cracked down mercilessly, killing at least twenty-four people in Odinga strongholds. The police\\\\n\\\\nclaimed the victims were criminals or inciting violence, but this is doubtful. In the lakeside city of Kisumu, police went house to house, hurling teargas and beating and shooting people. Some victims were dragged out of bed and killed. At least ten deaths have been so far documented in this city alone, and more than a hundred others were beaten or suffered gunshot wounds. Among the dead are a nine-year-old girl shot by a stray bullet in Nairobi while playing on her balcony and a six-month-old beaten to death, in her own house, while in her mother\\'s arms. After Kisumu Governor Peter Anyang Nyong\\'o told reporters that fishermen had\\\\n\\\\ndiscovered five corpses in body bags floating in Lake Victoria, at least one of which had bullet wounds, the police claimed they were all drowning victims.\\\\n\\\\nThe Times editorial also failed to mention that reporters covering the police abuses have been beaten and arrested and that two highly respected Kenyan NGOs investigating them were closed down and raided by the police. A similarly misleading editorial appeared in The Washington Post\\\\n\\\\non the day the election results appeared.\\\\n\\\\nThe US government has a disturbing history of meddling in the politics of developing countries; during the cold war, it also influenced some of our most prominent editors and journalists to downplay human rights abuses committed by its undemocratic allies. In countries like Kenya, where important US interests are at stake, the onslaught of mass-media distortions, and biased international election observers and Western-backed NGOs, suggest the possibility of concerted strategy. As the Chinese general Sun Tzu put it in his famous book The Art of War , \\\\\"To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.\\\\\" But to do that, you need to make him feel he has already lost.\\\\n\\\\nRELATED\\\\n\\\\nGlossing Africa\\\\n\\\\nNamwali Serpell\\\\n\\\\nRepression in Rwanda\\\\n\\\\nAnjan Sundaram\\\\n\\\\nWho\\'s Afraid of African Democracy?\\\\n\\\\nHelen Epstein\\\\n\\\\nTrump\\'s Hoodlums\\\\n\\\\nMasha Gessen\\\\n\\\\nFukushima from Within\\\\n\\\\nRyan Holmberg\\\\n\\\\nCartier-Bresson in India\\\\n\\\\nRatik Asokan\\\\n\\\\nAlice Coltrane\\'s Bliss\\\\n\\\\nAndrew Katzenstein\\\\n\\\\nWhat Makes a Terrorist?\\\\n\\\\nNafees Hamid\\\\n\\\\nFROM THE CURRENT ISSUE\\\\n\\\\n-- -- AUGUST 17 -- --\\\\n\\\\nNew York\\'s Housing Crisis\\\\n\\\\nMichael Greenberg\\\\n\\\\nEnding at the Beginning\\\\n\\\\nJohn Banville\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.jamiiforums.com\\\\/threads\\\\/the-election-the-cover-up.1310483\\\\/\"},\"26\":{\"source\":\"USA Today\",\"text\":\"25 must-see buildings in California Fullscreen Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles: Designed by Frank Gehry and completed in 2003, Disney Concert Hall is the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra and the Los Angeles Master Chorale.

The iconic stainless steel curves -- unmistakably Gehry -- contrast with the rich hardwood panels of the similarly curvaceous (but symmetrical) auditorium. Carol HighsmithFullscreen Majestic Yosemite (Ahwahnee Hotel), Yosemite National Park: The Ahwahnee Hotel opened in 1927 on a site chosen for its views of many of the iconic sights in Yosemite, including Glacier Point, Half Dome and Yosemite Falls. Designed by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood, it is a premiere example of National Park Service rustic architecture and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. In 2016, the Ahwahnee was renamed the Majestic Yosemite Hotel, on account of a legal dispute between the Park Service, which owns the property, and the outgoing concessionaire, Delaware North, which claims rights to the trademarked name. Edward Beltran, Hornberger + WorstellFullscreen Hearst Castle, San Simeon: Designed by Julia Morgan, the first female architect to receive the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal, the Hearst Castle was built for newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. Construction on the Mediterranean Revival-style villa started in 1919 and continued through the 1940s. Since 1958, it has been operated as the Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument, where the estate and its considerable collection of art and antiques are open for public tours. Stan ShebsFullscreen Monterey Bay Aquarium, Monterey: Designed by architecture firm EHDD, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a technological tour de force, drawing water directly from the bay to make possible, among other extraordinary exhibits, the only kelp forest in captivity. Since its opening on what had been a derelict stretch of Cannery Row, which its design mirrors, the aquarium has transformed public expectations with its tight focus on the ecosystem around it and how that can be protected, enhanced and treasured by human visitors. As a recipient of the AIA\\'s Twenty-Five Year award, it is a role model for aquariums everywhere. Steve ProehlFullscreen Mission Basilica San Diego de Alcala, San Diego: As the mother of the Spanish missionary movement in California, Mission San Diego de Alcal\\\\u00e1 is the first of 21 missions built progressively northward as far as the Sonoma Valley. Completed in 1796 by Fr. Jose Bernardo Sanchez, the design was influenced by the available construction materials and a desire to emulate notable structures in Spain. This National Historic Landmark is open to people of all faiths and is one of California\\'s most popular historic sites. Allan FergusonFullscreen Condominium One, The Sea Ranch: The Sea Ranch, a residential development on the Pacific Coast in northern Sonoma County, is admired for its sensitive relation to the rocky coastline, former sheep meadows and wooded hills. Many of the homes are available as vacation rentals, as are some units in Condominium One, a complex designed by Moore Lyndon Turnbull Whitaker in 1965. Jim AlinderFullscreen The timber-framed structure, on a bluff overlooking the Pacific, is a modern interpretation of the vernacular farm buildings that preceded it. In 1991, it received the AIA Twenty-five Year Award, and it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Jim AlinderFullscreen Transamerica Building, San Francisco: Designed by architect William Pereira, the 48-story Transamerica Pyramid was widely criticized, by both architects and everyday citizens, when the design was unveiled in 1969. Today, it is a beloved icon of the city, the anchor of Columbus Avenue and the pivot between the high-rises of the Financial District and the cafes of North Beach. At 853 feet, it was the tallest building in San Francisco until surpassed by the Salesforce Tower, currently under construction. Beyond My KenFullscreen Wayfarers Chapel, Rancho Palos Verdes: Located on cliffs above the Pacific Ocean, the Wayfarers Chapel is the work of Lloyd Wright, son of the far more famous Frank Lloyd Wright. A glass pavilion, it was designed to anticipate the overarching \\\\\"cathedral\\\\\" of redwoods, which were planted at the time of its construction in 1951. The Wayfarers Chapel is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Carol M. HighsmithFullscreen Eichler Homes: Real estate developer Joseph Eichler built over 11,000 Mid-Century Modern homes in dozens of communities across California. Eichler commissioned well-known architects to design both the site plans and the homes themselves. The largest contiguous Eichler Homes development is \\\\\"The Highlands\\\\\" in San Mateo, south of San Francisco, built between 1956 and 1964. An annual tour of Highland Eichlers -- eichlerhometour.org -- benefits the local elementary school. AIAFullscreen Hallidie Building, San Francisco: Built in 1918, this office building designed by architect Willis Polk is named in honor of San Francisco cable car pioneer Andrew Smith Hallidie. Sherman TakataFullscreen It is one the first American buildings to feature glass curtain walls. Currently, it houses the offices of the San Francisco chapter of the American Institute of Architects, along with other tenants. Sherman TakataFullscreen Marston House, San Diego: Originally the home of George W. Marston, American politician, department store owner and philanthropist, the Marston House is now a museum and historic landmark. Designed by Irving John Gill, it is considered a prime example of architecture from the Arts and Crafts movement. The home was completed in 1904 and is surrounded by 5 acres of rolling lawns and formal gardens by landscape architects Samuel Parsons, Jr., and George Cooke. Photojack53Fullscreen Marin County Civic Center, San Rafael: Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the Marin County Civic Center was completed in 1962, three years after Wright\\'s death. It is Wright\\'s largest public project, and encompasses an entire campus of civic structures, dramatically wedded to the landscape. The Marin County Civic Center main building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991. NicktoneFullscreen Cathedral of Christ the Light, Oakland: The Cathedral of Christ the Light, the heart of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland, was designed by architect Craig Hartman of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and opened in 2008. Its plan is a vesica piscis, a fish-shaped Christian symbol formed from the intersection of two circles. Raised on a concrete base, the cathedral overlooks Oakland\\'s Lake Merritt. Cesar RubioFullscreen The sanctuary -- a louvered wooden shell contained within a truncated glass cone -- is remarkable for its quality of light. Cesar RubioFullscreen Union Station, Los Angeles: Los Angeles Union Station is the largest railroad passenger terminal in the western United States. Designed by the father-and-son team of John and Donald Parkinson, with an attached restaurant by famed Southwestern architect Mary Colter, it opened in May 1939. Its combination of Art Deco, Mission Revival and Streamline Moderne styles has become known as \\\\\"Mission Moderne.\\\\\" Like many such stations, its fortunes dimmed with the rise of automobile travel, but it has recently reemerged as a major transit hub and arts and entertainment destination. Pedro SzekelyFullscreen Oakland Museum, Oakland: The Oakland Museum of California is an interdisciplinary museum dedicated to the art, history and natural science of California. The building, designed by Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates, is an important example of Mid-Century Modernism and the integration of indoor and outdoor space. Visitors to the museum will discover three levels of galleries, with gardens on each level that form the roof of the level below. Broad flights of stairs and trellised walkways connect one level to the next. Mark Cavagnero Associates completed a significant renovation in 2012. Tim GriffithFullscreen Eames House, Los Angeles: The Eames House is a landmark of mid-20th century modern architecture. Designed in 1949 by husband-and-wife design pioneers Charles and Ray Eames to serve as their home and studio, it is constructed largely of off-the-shelf parts. The house is now operated by a foundation established in 2004 and is open to the public by appointment. In 2006, the Eames House was designated a National Historic Landmark. Gunnar KlackFullscreen Neurosciences Institute, San Diego: Nobel Prize-winning biologist Gerald Edelman commissioned Tod Williams Billie Tsein Architects to design \\\\\"a monastery for scientists.\\\\\" They responded by arranging the three components of the institute -- theory center, laboratories and auditorium -- to form a quiet courtyard, carved into the sloping site. Michael MoranFullscreen In 2014, the Neurosciences Institute moved to smaller quarters; the Scripps Research Institute now uses the buildings for its molecular imaging department. The auditorium is used for public events. Michael MoranFullscreen Mission Inn, Riverside: The Mission Inn, now known as The Mission Inn Hotel & Spa, is a historic landmark hotel and is considered the largest Mission Revival-style building in the U.S., though the structure also incorporates many other architectural styles. Completed in 1932, it was designed by multiple architects: Arthur B. Benton designed the original building, Myron Hunt designed the Spanish Wing added to the rear of the main building, and G. Stanley Wilson designed the St. Francis Chapel and a rotunda featuring circular staircases and a dome. OleknutleeFullscreen Crown Zellerbach Building, San Francisco: The Crown Zellerbach Building, also known as One Bush Plaza, was constructed in the late 1950s. Designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, it was the first significant structure erected in downtown San Francisco in the 30 years following the start of the Great Depression. Skidmore, Owings & MerrillFullscreen It was the first International Style curtain-wall tower in San Francisco and one of the first International Style towers in the U.S., being completed shortly after New York\\'s Lever House and Seagram Building. Skidmore, Owings & MerrillFullscreen Salk Institute, La Jolla: The Salk Institute for Biological Studies is an independent, non-profit, scientific research institute founded in 1960 by Jonas Salk, the developer of the polio vaccine. Salk commissioned the architect Louis Kahn to \\\\\"create a building worthy of a visit by Picasso.\\\\\" Offices for individual researchers flank a dramatic plaza that looks out to the ocean horizon from the coastal bluffs north of San Diego. Few buildings are as universally admired by architects as the Salk. The original buildings of the Salk Institute were designated as a historical landmark in 1991. TheNoseFullscreen King\\'s Road House, West Hollywood: Architect Rudolf M. Schindler designed this cooperative live\\\\/work space for two young families in 1922. Also known as the Schindler House, it was a departure from typical residential architecture because of what it did not have: a conventional living room, dining room or bedrooms. The concrete walls and sliding glass panels made novel use of industrial materials, while the open floor plan integrated the outdoors into the residence. Considered the birthplace of Southern California Modernism, it is open to the public for unguided visits. Tim SakamotoFullscreen M.H. DeYoung Memorial Museum, San Francisco: Named for newspaperman and founder M. H. de Young, this fine arts museum was designed by architects Herzog & de Meuron and Fong + Chan, with landscape by Hood Design. Located in San Francisco\\'s Golden Gate Park, opposite the equally engaging Academy of Sciences by architect Renzo Piano, its copper cladding is pierced and dimpled to create a play of light similar to that of the surrounding tree canopy. It is a pioneering example of computer-assisted design and fabrication; no two pieces of the cladding are the same. Fine Arts Museums of San FranciscoFullscreen Frey House II, Palm Springs: Considered the father of Desert Modernism, Albert Frey designed this house for himself in 1964. Built into the hillside at the west end of Tahquitz Canyon Way and overlooking the Coachella Valley, it was designed following a very careful survey of the site. Frey fitted the glass to the rock, with the slope of the roof following that of the terrain. One of its most famous elements is the incorporation of a large boulder that acts as a divider between the bedroom and living room. HomeDITFullscreen Hollyhock House, East Hollywood: Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright as a residence for oil heiress Aline Barnsdall and completed in 1921, Hollyhock House is Wright\\'s first Los Angeles-area project and represents his earliest efforts to develop a regionally appropriate style of architecture for Southern California. In 1927, Aline Barnsdall gave Hollyhock House and 11 surrounding acres to the City of Los Angeles for use as a public park in memory of her father, Theodore Barnsdall. The building is now the centerpiece of the city\\'s Barnsdall Art Park. Flickr\\\\/Kent KanouseFullscreen Gamble House, Pasadena: The Gamble House is an outstanding example of American Arts and Crafts-style architecture. Architects Charles and Henry Greene designed the house and furnishings for David and Mary Gamble of the Procter & Gamble Company in 1908.

Originally, the building was constructed to consolidate all merchandising offices of the Sears & Roebuck company into one building. This was accomplished in the first 50 floors, each of which covers 50,000 square feet. The design of the building was decided on over lunch at the Chicago Club. Engineer Fazlur Khan believed that the bundled tube system would be the most efficient for a building of such magnitude, but he worried about the aesthetics. Architect Bruce Graham, however, used a handful of cigarettes to illustrate how each tube could rise to a different height. In 2009, a retractable glass balcony was added to the 103th-floor Skydeck. With its all-glass floor, this daring act of architecture continues to keep the observatory as one of Chicago\\'s top architectural attractions. AIAFullscreen Wrigley Field, Chicago: Located on Chicago\\'s near North Side, the ivy-studded Wrigley Field has been the home of Chicago Cubs baseball since 1916. The oldest National League ball park was designed by Zachary Taylor Davis in 1914 for the Chicago Whales of the Federal League, with a single deck capable of seating 14,000 spectators. The second deck was added in 1926-27, increasing the seating capacity to just over 37,000. The hand-operated scoreboard, constructed in 1935-37 and measuring 27 feet high by 75 feet wide, is still being used today to provide inning-by-inning scores of all major league games as well as pitching changes. Until 1988, Wrigley was the only ball park in the major leagues without lights, restricting its use to daytime games. The lighting equipment to be installed in 1941 was instead donated by owner Paul Wrigley to the war effort the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. While other alterations have occurred since then, none have marred the park\\'s basic configuration or stripped its status as one of major league baseball\\'s most venerable structures. The park is also important in football history, being home to the Chicago Bears from 1920 until their move to Soldier Field in the early 1970s. AIAFullscreen Millennium Park, Chicago: Situated at the north end of Grant Park, Millennium Park entices thousands of visitors to stop, look and listen, every day. In 1997, Mayor Daley commissioned a team to design a park over existing railroad tracks. The result was the lively collage of elements seen today that include the Jay Pritzker Pavilion by Frank Gehry, the interactive Crown Fountain by Spanish artist Jaume Plensa, and the conceptual landscape of the Lurie Garden, designed by the team of Kathryn Gustafson, plants expert Piet Oudolf, and theatrical set designer Robert Israel. But perhaps Millennium Park\\'s most iconic element is Cloud Gate, a 66-foot-wide bean-shaped sculpture by London-based Anish Kapoor, completed in 2004. Peter J. SchulzFullscreen Illinois Institute of Technology Campus, Chicago: Designed in 1940 by a founder of Modern architecture, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) academic campus is comprised of 26 buildings in a 60-acre densely urban setting, which set the precedent for modernist campus design. (Thomas Jefferson\\'s University of Virginia \\\\\"quadrangle\\\\\" plan was the prior traditional style.) IIT is laid out on a 24 feet horizontal by 12 feet vertical modular grid, which determined the scale and placement for structures and open space on the campus. Mies himself designed 14 of the buildings while director of the school\\'s architecture program from 1938-1958, utilizing a simple palette of steel, glass and buff-colored brick, reflecting the industrial buildings of Chicago\\'s South Side. S. R. Crown Hall (1950-56) stands out as the most celebrated structure on IIT\\'s campus, which represents the largest concentration of Mies-designed buildings in the world. Crown Hall, a National Historic Landmark, consists solely of glass and steel, with large roof trusses that allow an open and flexible interior, considered by many as one of the most important buildings of the 20th century. AIAFullscreen Galena Main Street: Galena\\'s Main Street contains one of the best collections of mid-19th century commercial buildings in the country. The street is even more distinctive because of its curve, which follows the topography of the hill and the Fever River. In a state where cities were platted on a grid in the prairie, Galena is distinctive for both its natural topography and architecture. The building facades are virtually all masonry, with vertically proportioned windows in the architectural styles popular from the 1830s to the 1880s. Particularly noteworthy to the street\\'s commercial buildings are the large number of 19th- and early 20th-century shop fronts. In the area of retail design, shop fronts were frequently changed, but in Galena there are few that date from later than 1920. A walk down Galena\\'s Main Street is an architecture tour of the 19th century Main Street with a little bit of the early 20th century. The town of Galena was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. AIAFullscreen Art Institute of Chicago: Originally constructed in 1893 as the World\\'s Colombian Exposition Congress Auxiliary Building, the AIC school and galleries are located in Chicago\\'s Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District in the Loop community area bounded by Grant Park on the east. The core of the current complex, opposite Adams Street, officially opened in December 1893, and was renamed the Allerton Building in 1968. There have been numerous building additions over the years. Designed and constructed between 1962 and 1967, the tree-lined garden features a rectangular pool that terminates at Lorado Taft\\'s \\\\\"Fountain of the Great Lakes\\\\\" sculpture. The centerpiece of the Columbus Drive addition is Adler and Sullivan\\'s magnificent Chicago Stock Exchange Trading Room, which was salvaged from demolition and restored and painstakingly installed in 1977. The most recent addition is the 2009 Renzo Piano-designed Modern Wing, which increased gallery space by 65,000 square feet and accommodates the 15,000-square-foot Ryan Education Center facilities. The Modern Wing incorporates cutting-edge green technologies such as \\\\\"The Flying Carpet,\\\\\" an extruded aluminum sunshade to filter daylight, linked to the lighting system\\'s incandescent fixtures. The Nichols Bridgeway, a 625-foot pedestrian bridge also designed by Piano, links the Institute building to Millennium Park. AIAFullscreen Chicago Riverwalk: Often called the Second City\\'s second lakefront, the Riverwalk is an urban, pedestrian, linear park, located on the south bank of the Chicago River in downtown Chicago, spanning from Lake Shore Drive to Franklin Street. It is a great discovery point to the city\\'s laboratory for architectural innovation in significant skyscrapers, museums, theaters, bridges, homes, universities, houses of worship and commerce. This linear \\\\\"playscape\\\\\" offers an active venue to learn about the river\\'s past and the city\\'s plans for the future, to view a series of bridges over the Chicago River, and to pick up the Windy City\\'s Lake Michigan Trail system. Design plans include conceptual ideas for each of the six blocks from State Street west to Lake Street with distinctive identities and purpose, thematically named: The Marina (from State to Dearborn), The Cove (Dearborn to Clark), The River Theater (Clark to LaSalle), The Swimming Hole (LaSalle to Wells), The Jetty (Wells to Franklin) and The Boardwalk (Franklin to Lake). Ranvestel PhotographicFullscreen Farnsworth House, Plano: Designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in 1951 for Edith Farnsworth, the house is located near Plano in an organic, rural setting on the banks of the Fox River. In contrast to the native grounds, the house is one of the most exactingly detailed works of modernist domestic architecture, cleverly engineered to stand up from the ground in response to its flood-prone location. It was unprecedented in its day and still confronts the visitor with the basic question of \\\\\"what is a house?\\\\\" The all-glass exterior walls and the gleaming white steel structure are a forceful work of architectural sculpture set in nature. As historian Franz Schulze has remarked: \\\\\"Certainly the house is more nearly temple than dwelling, and it rewards aesthetic contemplation before it fulfills domestic necessity.\\\\\" Jeff A. GoldbergFullscreen Dana-Thomas House, Springfield: The Dana-Thomas House is one of the largest and most intact of the \\\\\"Prairie School\\\\\" houses designed by Frank Lloyd Wright during the first decade of the 20th century. The Prairie School period marked a major change in American residential architecture, with the use of \\\\\"natural\\\\\" materials and an emphasis on form rather than applied ornament. The exterior design emphasizes horizontality with its distinctive plaster frieze, the wide over-hanging eaves, and raked horizontal mortar joints. Another distinctive feature of Wright\\'s design is the highly stylized art glass \\\\\"light screens.\\\\\" The interior of the house features a series of interconnected spaces surrounding a central two-story space, with careful use of exterior porches that architecturally blend with interior spaces. The house was originally built in 1903 for Susan Lawrence Dana and was her home for 25 years. The house had a second period of use as an office building for the Thomas Publishing Co. In 1974 the structure was listed in the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. The house was purchased by the State of Illinois in 1981 and restored to the early 20th-century appearance in 1990. Doug CarrFullscreen Starved Rock Lodge, Utica: Built on a wooded bluff overlooking the Illinois River, the Starved Rock State Park design reflected the increasing democratization of American recreation in the first half of the 20th century. The lodge was part of a concerted effort under Governor Henry Horner and Robert Kingery, director of the Department of Public Works and Buildings, to expand and create accessibility in the Illinois state park system. Built to rival more expensive private resorts, the labor to build the lodge and cabins at several state parks was delivered through the New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps. The Lodge at Starved Rock, although modernized and updated, still retains the massive natural charm and rustic beauty of the original stone and heavy timber construction and much of its historic furnishings. The building style combines the rusticity of the Adirondack lodges, with picturesque details of the English Arts and Crafts. Under the guidance of Joseph Booton, chief of design, Division of Architecture and Engineering for the State of Illinois, the lodge was designed in less than 10 days and constructed over six years. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Kathy CasstevensFullscreen State Capitol Building, Springfield: The design for Illinois\\' fifth state capitol, by Chicago\\'s John Crombie Cochran with his partner, French-born architect Alfred Piquenard, was the winning entry in an 1867 competition. Completed at a cost of $4.5 million, the Illinois State Capitol building is an elaborate Second Empire edifice with a tall Renaissance-style dome separating the two cameral wings. The building exterior boasts pressed-metal and carved stone ornament with interior marble and faux plaster marble \\\\\"scagliola,\\\\\" and various examples of stenciling. An extensive $51 million renovation project, begun in 2009, to restore key spaces throughout the west wing\\'s four floors and basement and provide new energy-efficient HVAC systems, life safety, accessibility and security upgrades was certified LEED Gold in 2014. Illinois\\' State House is a Springfield City Landmark and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Craig MillerFullscreen Haish Memorial Library, DeKalb: Over the past hundred years, DeKalb\\'s public library has evolved from a modest reading room furnished with gas lights and magazines to a beautiful and architecturally significant stand-alone building offering a wide variety of services, programs and up-to-date research technology. The community-minded spirit that led the local ladies of the Library Whist Club to found it in 1893 has remained for decades. On Feb. 15, 1931, the beautiful Haish Memorial Library Building at 309 Oak Street was dedicated. Built on land provided by the city and financed by a bequest of $150,000 from barbed-wire millionaire Jacob Haish, the striking building with its Indiana Bedford limestone facade soon gained national recognition through an article in \\\\\"Architecture\\\\\" magazine. In 1934, the library received a mural by Gustaf Dahlstrom from the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project. The mural is installed over the fireplace in the main reading room. In the 1960s the art gallery in the east wing was made into a children\\'s room and the stacks were expanded upward. In 1978-79 a two-story addition on the south side provided for the reference room and a lower-level children\\'s room, and saw the east wing become the fiction room. In 1980, the Haish Memorial Library Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Ballogg PhotographyFullscreen Naper Settlement, Naperville: A living history village, Naper Settlement tells the story of how life was transformed throughout the 19th century from a pioneer outpost in 1831 to a bustling turn-of-the century community. Through its 30 historic buildings located on the 12-acre grounds, history and culture is brought to life with educational and hands-on activities for 150,000 visitors each year. More than 30 years before the settlement and the Naperville Heritage Society were established, Caroline Martin Mitchell laid the groundwork by donating her family\\'s Victorian mansion and surrounding 212 acres to the City of Naperville in 1936. One of her requests was that her home, built in 1883, would remain a museum in perpetuity. Today, her home has been brought back to its original Victorian splendor through a three-year, $2.8 million restoration project that was completed in November of 2003. The project encompassed a thorough interior and exterior restoration of the 19th-century brick mansion and its adjacent frame carriage house. Restored to a period of historic significance, these properties now accurately convey the residential and agricultural practices of Victorian-era society. AIAFullscreen Chicago Cultural Center: Originally constructed as the city\\'s main public library, the Chicago Cultural Center was constructed in a Classical-Revival style made popular by the 1893 Chicago World\\'s Fair, and which also proved to be the dominant style for public libraries during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The city hired Boston architectural firm Shepley Rutan & Coolidge because of its expertise in designing libraries. The stone exterior is carefully executed with classical proportions and details derived from the Italian Renaissance style. The interior spaces were extensively decorated with marble stairs, stained glass and ornamental bronze work. The most sumptuous interior appointments, however, are the cosmati mosaics comprised of small pieces of Favrile glass, colored stone, mother of pearl and gold leaf inlaid into white marble. Prairie School architect Robert C. Spencer designed the elaborate mosaics, which were executed by the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company. The building served its original function for almost a century before a 1977 Holabird & Root restoration gave it new life as a center for city cultural programs. AIAFullscreen University of Illinois Quad, Urbana: At the heart of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus, the quad consists of a 203-foot-wide by 940-foot-long rectangle defined by 13 buildings and the diagonal pathways and lawns in between. It grew out of the Blackall-Olmsted Plan of 1905, the first formal master plan for the university, which is responsible for the rectilinear, symmetric, formal quality of the quad today. The buildings on the quad represent a wide variety of styles including the 1892 Victorian-Gothic Natural History Building by Nathan C. Ricker, the 1895 Richardsonian-Romanesque Altgeld Hall by Ricker and James McLaren White, the 1899 Neo-Classical Davenport Hall by Joseph C. Llewellyn, the 1905 Georgian-Revival English Building by McKim, Mead & White, and the 1968 Modernist Foreign Languages Building by Holabird & Root. The Beaux Arts Classical-style Foellinger Auditorium was designed in 1906 by Clarence Blackall to pay homage to Thomas Jefferson\\'s library at the University of Virginia. In 2012, Lincoln Hall on the southwest corner underwent a $66 million restoration. L. Brian Stauffer, University of IllinoisFullscreen Principia College, Elsah: Renowned San Francisco architect Bernard Maybeck (1862-1957) convinced the director of Principia College in 1931 that a campus designed after an English village would \\\\\"express the spirit of home, of peace, and of absolute harmony with [its] physical surroundings.\\\\\" Maybeck, an architect whose personal style would inspire the informal Bay Region architecture of post-World War II, began planning the college in 1924, but it wasn\\'t until 1931 that the first structure was built. In all, Maybeck designed 13 structures at Principia, of which 11 are still extant. He carefully positioned the Tudor and Colonial Revival buildings so they appear to have grown from their sites. The historic appearance of the buildings belies their imaginative construction techniques. For instance, what appears to be beautifully carved wooden trusses in Anderson Hall (1931-1934) are actually of painstakingly cast concrete. The buildings\\' meticulous architectural details comprise the perfect metaphor for a student\\'s quest for discovery and perfection. Principia College was named a National Historic Landmark in 1993. Principia CollegeFullscreen Unity Temple, Oak Park: Unity Temple stands as a remarkable work of religious architecture for its bold break with traditions and its innovative use of a concrete as a construction material. Frank Lloyd Wright\\'s design for this building, with its solid cubes and clerestory windows, is a dramatic departure from the typical church of the day. Wright\\'s 1906 design was innovative and challenging, making it a leading example of a new type of religious building which would emerge in the 20th century. The interior sanctuary is enclosed by walls with only clerestory lighting, to contain the space and focus the congregation on the inside while shutting them out from the everyday noises of the commercial street in front. Wright\\'s use of poured-in-place concrete to create the exterior walls and details is one of the earliest uses of this material in a total architectural expression. A material that was otherwise being utilized for structural and utilitarian purposes is exploited by Wright for both massive effect and ornamental detail. Unity Temple was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. IvoShandorFullscreen The Deere & Company Administration Center, Moline: A striking example of designer Eero Saarinen\\'s career-long goal to create architecture that is a reflection of the client\\'s identity as it fits into the surrounding physical environment is met at Deere World Headquarters. President of Deere & Company William Hewitt hoped to convey a sense of strength and ruggedness through this complex that was to become the company\\'s office headquarters. To do this, Saarinen designed the early 1960s complex of buildings using steel as the main structural and decorative material. Paired with expansive sheets of glass to form the building envelope, the open steel-framed design allows for virtually unimpeded views of the naturally landscaped site from within the buildings. The Administration Center is composed of three buildings which are connected by glass-and-steel walkways. Central to the complex is the administration building, positioned in front of an artificial lake. To either side are the auditorium building and the engineering building. Deere & CompanyFullscreen Pullman National Historic Monument, Chicago: Pullman is a Chicago neighborhood on the site of the early town established by the Pullman Palace Car Company. It was the setting for the evolution of industrial manufacturing and railroad transportation, the advancement of town planning, and played a role in the foundation of U.S. labor law, and African American civil liberty. The Information Center stands today on the site of the historic Pullman Arcade Building at the corner of 112th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. The building is an adaptive reuse of the southern portion of the former neighborhood American Legion Building, which had been built on the site in 1953. On the north wall of the Information Center is a mural, entitled \\\\\"Visual Interpretations of Pullman,\\\\\" depicting the former Pullman Arcade Building, coupled with an historic view of the Pullman Town, ironworkers and a Pullman Palace Car. This vibrant piece of public art was completed in 1996 by students from the American Academy of Art. A strategic plan created by a design team of AIA Chicago\\'s Regional and Urban Design Knowledge Committee involving 40 volunteer architects and designers guided by Richard Wilson, AIA, of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill with generous support from The Chicago Community Trust, Richard H. Driehaus Foundation, and Alphawood Foundation is helping further opportunities for enhancing the visitor experience while advancing important community development goals to improve quality of life for residents. Raymond Boyd, Michael Ochs Archives via Getty ImagesFullscreen Anderson Japanese Gardens, Rockford: On a visit to Portland, Ore., Rockford industrialist John Anderson found himself at the Japanese garden in Washington Park. Anderson, an admirer of Japanese culture, was awestruck. He immediately hired the park\\'s landscape architect, Hoichi Kurisu, to design a similar garden on some of his Rockford acreage. Kurisu is a graduate of Tokyo\\'s Waseda University and a pupil of Kenzo Ogata, one of Japan\\'s most respected landscape designers. Construction began on the Anderson Japanese Gardens in 1978. The 14-acre wonderland, one of the largest Asian gardens in the country, consists of two very different gardens. The first is a formal Japanese garden in the style of the Kamakura period, 1185 to 1333 A.D., with a Guest House, Teahouse, and machiai in the 16th-century Sukiya style built by master carpenter Masahiro Hamada of Tokyo. Second is the Garden of Reflection, a contemporary international garden with a strong Japanese influence. The gardens are designed to allow guests to reflect upon the tranquil beauty of nature, to leave the stresses of everyday life, to commune with nature and thus with one\\'s self. The garden has been open to the general public since 1998. AIAFullscreen Cahokia Mounds Historic Site, Collinsville: Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site is the preserved central section of the largest prehistoric Native American city north of Mexico. Occupied from 700 to 1400 AD, the city grew to cover 4,000 acres, with a population of between 10,000 and 20,000 at its peak around 1100. The site is dominated by the Cahokia Mound, the largest prehistoric earthen mound in the Americas. It is over 100 feet high, 1,037 feet long, and 790 feet wide. The mound is comprised of four major construction layers, each smaller and more recently constructed than the last. The mound was probably used for ceremonial and government functions. In 1966, Cahokia Mounds was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and in 1983 was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. AIAFullscreen Bah\\\\u00e1\\'\\\\u00ed House of Worship, Wilmette: Known by the Bah\\\\u00e1\\'\\\\u00ed believers as \\\\\"The Mother Temple of the West,\\\\\" the imposing yet airy structure by Louis Bourgeois (1856-1930) echoes the religion\\'s principles of universality through its composite architecture. Readily discernible are details of Early Egyptian, Persian, Byzantine, Greek, Renaissance and Gothic styles, fused together to create a building that transcends style. The temple\\'s reinforced concrete structure is concealed by a lacy envelope with delicately sculptured designs in pre-cast panels of white cement, ground quartz and white granite aggregate, executed by John J. Early. The interior, detailed by Alfred Shaw (1895- 1970) of the firm Shaw, Metz and Dolio Architects, comprises a single circular auditorium rising into a hemispherical dome. The nonagonal design of the building extends onto the surrounding landscape with nine gardens, each with a pool and a fountain. The overall impression inside and out is of lightness and harmony, expressed through balanced masses unified by delicate and flowing details. The temple was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Scott ConradFullscreen BAPS Shree Swaminarayan Mandir, Bartlett: The largest traditional Hindu Mandir (temple) of stone and marble to be constructed in the United States is BAPS Shri Swaminarayan in Bartlett. Created entirely according to ancient Hindu architectural design manuscripts, known as the Shilpa-Shastras, and conforming to codes and regulations of today, it was completed in 2004 by Papadopoulos & Pradhan Architects, 16 months from the day its first stone was laid on site. Limestone from Turkey and marble from Italy was shipped to India and, along with local Makrana marble, carved in ancient patterns. Finished pieces were shipped from India to Illinois to build the intricately designed and exquisitely detailed Mandir. Over 40,000 stone pieces fit together to provide the structure with no use of iron or steel. Built by 1,700 volunteers, who collectively donated 2,500,000 man-hours, the Mandir opened on Aug. 8, 2004. The adjoining cultural center, known as the Haveli, is a revival of an ancient Indian architectural style that uses intricately carved wood elements. BAPS Shree Swaminarayan MandirFullscreen Aqua Tower, Chicago: Aqua is the tallest building in the United States designed by a woman-owned firm, Studio Gang. Though the basic structure is a standard, modern box, the colored glass and undulating white concrete balconies create a sculptural impression of slowly rippling water, as if to reflect Chicago\\'s lakefront majesty. Each individual balcony, an extension on a floor slab, is unique in size, shape and protrusion, providing a platform that enables residents to chat with neighbors above or below. The balconies also help to break up wind vortices, minimize wind shear and shade neighboring apartments, while preventing birds from colliding with windows. Building Aqua was a feat of engineering where GPS coordinates were used to precisely pour each of the 82 individual structural design elements. The wave-shaped balconies are arranged so each unit has a view of at least one of these six sites: Oak Street Beach, Navy Pier, Cloud Gate in Millennium Park, the Lake Street \\\\\"L\\\\\" tracks, the park in Lakeshore East and Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park. Studio GangFullscreen Allerton House & Park, Monticello: For more than 40 years, Robert Allerton (1873-196) worked on crafting a county estate in rural Illinois. He began construction in 1898, after his father, millionaire Samuel W. Allerton, assigned him the task of managing the family\\'s agricultural holdings in Piatt County. With Philidelphia architect John Borie (1869-1926), whom Allerton had met at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, he set about building a secluded compound that included an elaborate Colonial Revival country house with formal gardens and reforested wilderness within an extensive tenant farm system. Allerton was a great art collector, donating generously to the Art Institute of Chicago and keeping only enough sculpture, including Emile Bourdelle\\'s \\\\\"Death of the Last Centaur,\\\\\" to decorate the 1,500-acre grounds. Allerton\\'s manor and tenant farm ecosystem, donated to the University of Illinois in 1946 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2007, is perhaps the most personal and complete example of a 19th-century country estate in the region.

It was one of the first air-conditioned buildings in the city and the only air-conditioned theater. It featured \\\\\"The Mighty Wurlizter,\\\\\" an organ designed to be played with silent movies. The theater was closed in 1977. After sporadic attempts to keep it open, upgrades were made in 1981 and it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It was designated Tennessee\\'s State Theatre in 1999. The Mighty Wurlizter was restored in 2000. The theater was closed in 2002 for a 19-month, $30 million restoration\\\\/renovation by Knoxville architects McCarty Holsaple McCarty, in partnership with Westlake Reed Leskosky. Since 2005, the Tennessee has welcomed over 1.2 million patrons, presented or hosted more than 1500 events, and had an economic impact of more than $60 million. The Tennessee TheatreFullscreen Choo Choo Hotel: Built in 1909 as a fully operational train station, aptly named Terminal Station, the Choo Choo was made famous by the Glenn Miller song \\\\\"Chattanooga Choo Choo.\\\\\" Designed by Donn Barber, a student of the \\\\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, the station featured a large, arched main entrance as well as a ceiling dome with a skylight. Brass chandeliers completed the rooms, bestowing an air of grandeur. AIAFullscreen The station closed in 1970 and re-opened as the Chattanooga Choo Choo in 1972. Recently the property has undergone a transformation into a community hub with music, comedy, restaurants, apartments and retail in addition to the hotel rooms. AIAFullscreen The Parthenon: The original Nashville Parthenon stood in Centennial Park as part of the state\\'s Centennial Exposition in 1895-97. The building was so popular that the fair\\'s organizers decided to leave it after the exposition closed. As the temporary structure deteriorated, city officials decided to replace it with a permanent building. The current full-sized replica of the ancient Greek temple is emblematic of Nashville\\'s reputation as the \\\\\"Athens of the South.\\\\\" The building, begun in 1920 by Russell E. Hart and William B. Dinsmoor, is constructed of exposed aggregate concrete designed to resemble marble. The exterior includes accurate reproductions of the figures that once decorated the pediments of the temple. In 1990, a 42-foot-tall statue of Athena by Nashville sculptor Alan LeQuire was added to the temple interior. The Parthenon dominates Centennial Park, site of numerous art, theater and music festivals through the year. AIAFullscreen Union Station: Walking through the doors of Nashville\\'s historic Union Station Hotel is like taking a step back to a time when travel was not a necessity, but a luxury. Originally built in 1900 by architect Richard Montfort, the building\\'s Richardsonian Romanesque architecture with its turrets and towers was a testament to American ingenuity and energy. Union Station was a marvel of the (then) modern day, surprising and delighting travelers for decades with ornate wood carvings, sparkling stained glass, beautiful Italian marble and soaring ceilings. Fast-forward nearly 100 years and Union Station was in need of some new life and energy. In 1986 Union Station re-opened as a luxury hotel, and fall 2016 saw the completion of a $15.5 million renovation, by Edwards and Hotchkiss, preserving the hotel\\'s grand past in the soaring 65-foot barrel-vaulted ceiling and 100-year-old Tiffany-style stained glass in the lobby atrium, while newly transformed luxury accommodations and a new bar and restaurant cater to today\\'s discerning guest. AIAFullscreen Beale Street Landing: Beale Street Landing, designed by RTN Architects, is a state-of-the-art docking facility and civic center that welcomes the public to one of Memphis\\'s most wonderful natural resources: the Mississippi River. Natalie LeDouxFullscreen The project consists of a sophisticated passenger boat docking system, a casual dining restaurant, a 53-space paved parking lot, a terminal building housing a box office and gift shop, and two protruding pedestrian islands. At first glance, the arched grass roof may be the most notable feature of Beale Street Landing. The publicly accessible knoll allows for the commercial development beneath it without relinquishing what was before open green space. Aerial InnovationsFullscreen Tennessee State Capitol: Built on the highest point in downtown Nashville, this graceful building is a dominant figure on the skyline. Designed in the Greek Revival style by architect William Strickland, it is his last and perhaps finest building. He used all three Greek orders in the design of the classical temple-form building: a Doric basement, Ionic porticoes on all four sides, and a Corinthian-style cupola. The exterior was constructed of local limestone, built by slave and convict labor. Begun in 1845, it took 14 years to complete, outlasting Strickland himself. He died in 1854 and, in accordance with his wishes, is buried within the building\\'s northeast corner. Samuel Morgan, chairman of the State Building Commission overseeing the construction, is entombed in the southeast corner. AIAFullscreen Cades Cove, Great Smoky Mountains National Park: Visitors can explore historic architectural styles; spot white-tailed deer, turkeys and black bears; enjoy gorgeous mountain scenery; or take a leisurely bicycle ride around the 11-mile loop road. Cabins range from the earliest log structures to the fancier wood-sided homes. The iconic cantilever barns feature an overhang, or cantilever, which supports a large second-story loft atop one or more log cribs on the base story. Outstanding examples can be found at Billy Tipton\\'s and Becky Cable\\'s houses. Some barns have a single base; larger barns will have a double base. Early churches of varied denominations and the community\\'s schoolhouse are open. Additional structures are visible along miles of trails; more can be found for those who dare to venture off-trail. Wikimedia Commons\\\\/Billy HathornFullscreen Frist Center for the Visual Arts: The 1934 building, designed by Marr and Holman, served as the main United States Post Office for downtown Nashville until 1987. The underutilized building underwent extensive renovation and transformation by Tuck Hinton Architects, opening as the Frist Center for the Visual Arts in April 2001. The new gallery spaces and grand stair are adjacent and visible from the original renovated Art Deco lobby. Tim HursleyFullscreen Tennessee Aquarium: \\\\\"Architectural Record\\\\\" praised the nation\\'s first fresh-water aquarium as a \\\\\"cathedral of conservation.\\\\\" Cambridge Seven Associates was responsible for the design of this major public aquarium at the edge of the Tennessee River, the ecology and biological diversity of which is the aquarium\\'s focus. Glass pyramids atop the building reveal glimpses of wild habitats within, which feature fresh-water habitats with three major exhibits concentrating on the Tennessee\\\\/Mississippi River System: a mountain cove forest with a trout stream, a \\\\\"lake\\\\\" section of the river between dams near Chattanooga, and a cypress swamp of the Mississippi Delta. The exhibit has proved to be a profound economic redevelopment catalyst for the region. Todd Stailey, Tennessee AquariumFullscreen AT&T Building: The design and function of the 630.5-foot-high, 31-story, glass and red granite-based AT&T Office Tower distinguishes Nashville as a center for high-tech communications. The tallest building in Tennessee since 1994, the distinctive structure dominates Nashville\\'s skyline and occupies one and two-thirds of a city block and includes an 8,000-square-foot enclosed winter garden, and a nine-story underground parking garage. The facility, designed by Earl Swensson Associates, incorporates green space into an urban landscape through its public park at the main entrance and into another smaller park at the rear of the building, which works with the grade of the site by traversing over three levels. Adjacent to the office tower is a high-tech center, which is available to the general public for meeting space with a 250-seat auditorium, a 250-seat dining room and an executive dining area. AIAFullscreen The Hermitage: After winning the Battle of New Orleans, Andrew Jackson built a new plain brick Federal-style home, begun in 1819 and completed in 1821. In 1831, during Jackson\\'s first term as president, he hired architect David Morrison to enlarge the mansion by adding library and dining room wings and a two-story entrance portico with classical columns. The home you visit today is the third version of Jackson\\'s brick mansion. AIAFullscreen When fire significantly damaged the Hermitage mansion in 1834, Jackson remodeled the house for the third and final time. Rather than re-create Morrison\\'s design, builders Joseph Reiff and William Hume followed the fashionable Greek Revival style that used details and designs from classical architecture. The builders relied heavily on the pattern books of New England architect Asher Benjamin. Remodeling was finally finished in 1837, just as Jackson completed his second term as president and retired to The Hermitage. AIAFullscreen Norris Dam: Construction of the first dam in the TVA system began in 1933, just a few months after the creation of TVA, and was completed in 1936. It has two generating units with a net dependable capacity of 110 megawatts. The reservoir area also helped form the backbone for the Tennessee state park system. The dam is 265 feet high and stretches 1,860 feet across the Clinch River. The town of Norris was built to house construction workers on the dam. It was a planned community that became a model for others throughout the nation. TVA\\'s water management system stopped the regular, serious flooding along tributaries and the Tennessee river, providing jobs, energy and economic growth. TVAFullscreen Cheekwood: The 36-room mansion was built in 1929-32 as a country estate for the Leslie Cheek family. Bryant Fleming, designer of both the house and gardens, was known for his work on the estates of the wealthy across the country. The house and grounds were modeled on 18th-century English country houses and filled with English and European antiques. The landscape, irregular and rooted in the natural surroundings, was the focal point of the design - an opulent setting for the house. The site is on a hilltop abutted by the Warner Parks, which preserve the original views over undeveloped woodland. In 1959, the Cheek heirs, Huldah and Walter Sharp, deeded the house and grounds to become the Cheekwood Botanical Gardens and Fine Arts Center. The mansion has become an art museum with ongoing projects to restore many interior areas. The gardens have been extended and Botanic Hall, by Nashville architect Neil Bass, was built in 1971. AIAFullscreen Bridgestone Arena and Music City Center: The Bridgestone Arena, designed by Hart Freeland Roberts and Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum and the Music City Center, designed by tvsdesign, Tuck-Hinton Architects and Moody-Nolan Inc., are at the heart of the entertainment district in Nashville. The arena is the city\\'s major indoor entertainment facility, home to the NHL Nashville Predators. Built in 1994, the center anchored downtown development and expansion south of Broadway, including the recently opened new convention center. The arena\\'s architecture is a tribute to the city\\'s role as \\\\\"Music City USA.\\\\\" Ron Coons PhotographyFullscreen Directly across the street from the Bridgestone Arena is the Music City Center. The design of the 2.1-million-square-foot convention center is inspired by the sensuous curves and materials of musical instruments and the rolling green hills of Tennessee. It is located a short distance from the Historic Ryman Auditorium and numerous other cultural venues. Occupying six city blocks in downtown Nashville, the LEED Gold-certified project has a 4-acre vegetative roof, 845 solar panels and a 360,000-gallon rainwater collector. Since it opened in 2013, the Music City Center has been a catalyst for development in the surrounding South of Broadway (SOBRO) neighborhood. Wolf HoffmannFullscreen Memphis Slim Collaboratory: The historic home of famed blues musician Memphis Slim has been reconstructed into a music collaborator, designed by brg3s architects, where local artists can work together. Located adjacent to the Stax Museum in the Memphis neighborhood of Soulsville, the Collaboratory has reactivated the surrounding area. Ken WestFullscreen The space houses rehearsal space, a recording studio, workshops, career training, public performance space, community meeting room, and a computer lab. Ken WestFullscreen Hunter Museum of American Art: With three buildings representing 100 years of architecture, the Hunter Museum of American Art is a prominent feature of the Chattanooga skyline. The original 1904 classical revival mansion designed by the architecture firm Mead and Garfield in the Edwardian style has housed the museum since its opening in 1952. In 1975 an addition was designed by Chattanooga architects Derthick, Henley & Wilkerson in the Brutalist style, and a 2005 addition designed by Randall Stout now serves as the entrance to the museum. Built of concrete with a dramatic central atrium space, the addition has received several prestigious architectural awards. Tim GriffithFullscreen All Saints Chapel , Sewanee, University of the South: Architectural plans were drawn up by noted architect Ralph Adams Cram of New York and construction began in 1905 but was halted in 1907 due to the failure of the Bank of Winchester during the great financial panic of that year. In 1910, a wooden floor and ceiling were installed to make the chapel available for use. It was not until 1957, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the university, that Vice-Chancellor Edward McCrady initiated the completion of the chapel. Using Cram\\'s original plans and designs created by Dr. McCrady in 1937, construction began anew and the chapel was completed by July of 1959 by the architecture firm Ayres and Godwin. AIAFullscreen It seats about 800 for everyday use, but can hold up to about 1,500 for special events, with reduced aisles and additional chairs. The chapel is principally constructed of Sewanee sandstone. Shapard Tower rises 141 feet, and at the time of its construction housed the world\\'s third-largest carillon (56 bells). The interior of All Saints\\' was renovated in 2003. AIAFullscreen Memphis College of Art: In 1958, the Memphis Academy of Arts (now Memphis College of Art) moved into its current home, the award-winning building created by Roy Harrover (Mann & Harrover) located within the 342-acre Overton Park. The design was selected by world-famous architects Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson in an international competition. Mann & Harrover submitted a design that incorporated all the elements of the fine-arts center into one, easily expandable, ultra-modern structure. AIAFullscreen Hattiloo Theatre: Hattiloo Theatre, the first black repertory theater in Memphis, relocated to its new building in 2014. Now located in the heart of a vibrant and diverse urban entertainment district, the building, designed by archimania, helps Hattiloo to establish a prominent, visual presence. Hank MardukasFullscreen Hattiloo\\'s black box theaters allow the company to reconfigure the stage and audience seating as dictated by the needs of each theatrical production. The project is a 2016 World Architecture News (WAN) Performing Spaces Awards Finalist, and has received an AIA Gulf States Region Merit Award, AIA Tennessee Award for Excellence and an AIA Memphis Award for Excellence. Hank MardukasFullscreen The Jim Boyd BRIDGES Center: Architect Coleman Coker designed the entire BRIDGES Center, the first green commercial building in Memphis, as a learning tool tailored to the thousands of local youths who come through the nonprofit\\'s programs each year. Gary BaldwinFullscreen Based on studies showing adolescents learn best in an environment filled with adventure and a degree of danger, the building includes indoor and outdoor climbing walls and challenge courses (which are also open to the public), and a dearth of 90-degree angles in the interior stimulates the adolescent brain (and drives some adult brains crazy). It\\'s meant to be a place where all can come, with no high fences or other barriers. Michael NorrisFullscreen Levitt Shell (ANF Architects): The Orchestra Shell opened Sept. 13, 1936, as the result of the Works Progress Administration and the City of Memphis partnership. It cost just $11,935 to build and was dedicated to the people of Memphis for their entertainment. During the 1930s and 40s, the Shell was home to Memphis Open Air Theatre (MOAT) orchestra performances, light opera and musicals. Holly WhitfieldFullscreen Renamed the Municipal Shell, this stage hosted countless music festivals and local bands, community events and school outings. Over the decades, the Shell struggled through financial hardships, closing for the last time in 2004. In 2005, Friends of the Levitt Shell was created through the determination and vision of Thomas Boggs, Katie Smythe and Barry Lichterman. Holly WhitfieldFullscreen Life and Casualty (L&C) Tower: When it opened in 1957 the L&C Tower was Nashville\\'s first skyscraper and the tallest commercial building in the southeast. At 31 stories, it is an elegant mixture of Art Deco and International Style. The dark marble entrance and four-story lobby are impressive but human-scaled. Architect Edwin Keeble was concerned to control sunlight with window placement and vertical aluminum fins decades before energy conservation became a national concern. The neon L&C logo at the top of the building originally changed color to forecast the weather. Although no longer prominent on the skyline, the L&C tower remains a gem of Nashville\\'s 20th-century architecture. AIAFullscreen Ryman Auditorium: Thomas Ryman\\'s dream of a religious center for the people of Nashville was realized in 1892 with the opening of the Union Gospel Tabernacle, now known as Ryman Auditorium. Architect Hugh C. Thompson took Ryman\\'s dream and made it a tangible part of Nashville\\'s skyline. Thompson\\'s High Victorian Gothic design called for a structure with large gables, decorative buttressing, lancet windows, a soaring roofline and a limestone foundation. Thomas Ryman later claimed that his Tabernacle emulated the architecture of the famed Brooklyn Tabernacle of New York City. Despite Ryman\\'s concern with the structure\\'s exposed brick walls and the simple seating of its unadorned interior, it is those same elements that ironically make the building so beloved today. In 1993, the original building was rescued from demolition through a significant restoration initiative led by Hart Freeland Roberts, Inc, that also included a new \\\\\"front-of-house\\\\\" addition containing a new entrance and lobby, restrooms and a retail space. Chris HolloFullscreen Art + Architecture Building: The University of Tennessee\\'s Art + Architecture Building was built in 1981 and is home to the College of Architecture and Design and the College of Arts and Sciences School of Art. Co-designed by McCarty Holsaple McCarty\\'s founder Bruce McCarty and his son Doug McCarty, it was the award-winning submission of a competition of architects from across the state. The design features two long, four-story structures connected by a full-length clerestoried court. A unifying feature of the design, the central \\\\\"street,\\\\\" is an extension of the outdoors and provides a focus for internal activities. The space fosters community as students and faculty crisscross through the space on stairways and bridges. Architecture and design studios are open to light-filled balcony corridors. It features a sidewalk cafe, a tree-lined gathering place for students and faculty, and a hands-on student laboratory for the construction and display of experimental structures. The interior space is devoted to lab and studio areas in large flexible lofts. Additional spaces include an art gallery, auditorium, exhibition spaces, lecture rooms, studios, faculty offices and administrative areas. MHM, Inc.Fullscreen Ayers Hall: The original building was designed by Miller, Fullenwider, and Dowling Architects, of Chicago. In June of 1921, the 80,000-square-foot Ayres Hall was officially dedicated and named for Brown Ayres, the former president who envisioned the landmark but died prior to its completion. The Gothic Revival structure rises 140 feet above its base. The distinctive checkerboard feature at the top of the tower has been replicated in UT orange and white in the end zones at Neyland Stadium and at the ends of the court in Thompson-Boling Arena. The dirt removed from the hilltop was slurred downhill to create Shields-Watkins Field. In 2011, the building re-opened after a two-year, nearly $16 million renovation by Knoxville firms Ross\\\\/Fowler Architects\\\\/Landscape Architects and Architects Weeks, Ambrose and McDonald. Ayres Hall received LEED Silver Certification, UT\\'s first LEED-certified building, and was added to the National Trust for Historic Buildings.

It is built in both German Romanesque and Renaissance Revival styles. This building represents the German immigrant heritage of Indiana and has served as a center of musical, political and social life from the late 1800s to today. It is listed three times in the National Register of Historic Places. It houses an original theater and the oldest restaurant in Indianapolis, the Rathskeller, and an authentic Biergarten, where people pack in to see live music and sip German beers throughout the summer. Chris BucherFullscreen University of Notre Dame, South Bend (Willoughby Edbrooke): With its iconic Golden Dome, Touchdown Jesus, the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes and the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, it\\'s no wonder Cond\\\\u00e9 Nast Traveler ranked Notre Dame as the No. 2 most beautiful campus in America. The Golden Dome, atop the main building, is home to the 19-foot tall, 4,000-pound statue of the school\\'s namesake, Mary, \\\\\"Our Lady.\\\\\" Only a fistful of gold leaf is used to regild the dome and statue, and campus lore says removed gilt is applied to football helmets. Lore also says if Mary were to fall through the dome, she would land in the arms of a statue of Jesus, placed directly underneath her, several floors below. Notre Dame UniversityFullscreen Century Center\\\\/Island Pavilion, South Bend (Alliance Architects\\\\/Philip Johnson): Once a city eyesore, now transformed into a vibrant urban riverfront development that draws visitors for community festivals, concerts, weddings and more. Located along the St. Joseph River, the 11-acre Island Pavilion was completed in 2012 to complement the adjacent Century Center that was completed in 1977. This new community space has spurred additional development along the riverfront, which is just minutes from museums and University of Notre Dame.

With nearly 472,900 square feet of space over five floors and situated on 29 acres, the Children\\'s Museum of Indianapolis has more than 120,000 artifacts and specimens. It was originally built in 1925, and has grown and evolved through the years beckoning children - and grownups - to explore, learn and play. Visit IndyFullscreen Century of Progress Homes, Beverly Shores (Robert Law Weed\\\\/George Fred Keck\\\\/Murray D. Heatherington\\\\/Robert Smith Jr.\\\\/Walter Scholer): The historic model homes, including the Florida Tropical House (shown), didn\\'t start out along the National Lakeshore of the Indiana Dunes. They were designed and featured at the 1933 World\\'s Fair in Chicago, titled \\\\\"A Century of Progress.\\\\\" The houses starred in the fair\\'s Homes of Tomorrow exhibit, where nearly 50 million people gazed upon the future of residential architecture. Each home featured modern home appliances, such as dishwashers and air conditioners, along with innovative materials and new construction techniques. At the end of the fair, developer Robert Barttlett saw the houses as a marketing opportunity for a resort community he was developing in Indiana. However, Bartlett\\'s dream of creating a lakeside resort community in the middle of a depression failed. The National Park Service rescued the homes, and today they are undergoing rehabilitation with private funds through a partnership with Indiana Landmarks. Homes are open for public tours each fall. Lee LewellenFullscreen Columbus (various architects): This city of about 46,000 located south of Indianapolis is a destination for fans of modern architecture thanks to its staggering number of architectural masterpieces. Many of these are the works of some of the most enduring names in architecture, such as I.M. Pei, Richard Meier, Robert Venturi, Eliel and Eero Saarinen, Harry Weese and Deborah Berke. Public art is sprinkled throughout the community with works by artists such as Henry Moore, Dale Chihuly, Jean Tinguely and Robert Indiana. There are more than 70 notable projects and public art installations, and Columbus is home to seven National Historic Landmarks, which has helped it become a true Mecca of architecture. Indianapolis Museum of ArtFullscreen Indianapolis Motor Speedway: The Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which opened in 1909, is home to the famous 2.5-mile oval track and hosts the largest single-day sporting event in the world, the Indianapolis 500. An estimated 350,000 fans attended the race in 2016 to celebrate the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500, which has been called the \\\\\"Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\\\\\" Indianapolis architect Browning Day Mullins Dierdorf has designed several improvements at the track over the years. Visit IndyFullscreen Concordia Theological Seminary, Fort Wayne (Eero Saarinen): The villages of northern Germany were the inspiration for the Concordia Theological Seminary located on 191 acres in the northeast corner of Indiana. The seminary is a great example of a modern approach to campus design and well-detailed, interesting buildings. The tilt of the pitch of every roof is 23.5 degrees which also is the degree of tilt of the Earth on its axis. The direction of every roofline on the campus runs in the same direction, east to west. Each building on the campus is also designed around 5-foot, 4-inch modules, giving a natural flow and symmetry to the diverse pieces of campus. Visit Fort WayneFullscreen New Harmony (various architects): This small historic town (population 915) located on the Wabash River in southwestern Indiana is home to a collection of architectural gems, many designed by renowned architects, including the Athenaeum, designed by Richard Meier; the Gothic Revival-style David Dale Owen laboratory, built in 1859; and the Roofless Church, designed by Philip Johnson. During the early part of the 19th century, New Harmony was the site of two attempts to establish Utopian communities. Visit Posey CountyFullscreen Hinkle Fieldhouse, Indianapolis (Fermor S. Cannon\\\\/RATIO): Indiana is known for its love of basketball, and one of the best places to watch the game is at historic Hinkle Fieldhouse. Built in 1928, and most recently renovated in 2014, it\\'s home to the Butler Bulldogs. It\\'s also recognized as the sixth oldest college basketball arena still in use - although it was transformed into U.S. military barracks during WWII from 1943 to 1945. The arena originally was named the Butler Fieldhouse but was renamed in 1966 in honor of the legendary athletic director and three-sport coach Paul \\\\\"Tony\\\\\" Hinkle. It has also been used as a movie set for the classic sports movie \\\\\"Hoosiers.\\\\\" The Fieldhouse was named on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. Visit IndyFullscreen Indiana State Museum, Indianapolis (RATIO): Located in White River State Park, the museum tells the story of Indiana\\'s past, present and future through scientific, cultural, history and art exhibits. The building was designed using all Indiana material, including limestone, sandstone, steel, brick and glass. The building itself is a work of art, with icons representing each of Indiana\\'s 92 counties integrated into its exterior walls. Chuck Smith, The Indiana State Museum and Historic SitesFullscreen Indiana War Memorial, Indianapolis (Walker & Weeks): This mausoleum-style limestone and marble memorial pays homage to Hoosiers killed during the war. It also houses a 30,000-square-foot museum that portrays American military history from the Revolutionary War to present day. The design of the building was based on one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the Tomb of King Mausolos. The interior includes marble paneling, refined metal fixtures and fittings, decorative plaster cornices and marble floors. The raised base was designed to accommodate a large auditorium and two large meeting rooms. The grand Shrine Room is located on the upper floors and is a breathtaking example of American classicism. Visit IndyFullscreen Grouseland, Vincennes (William Lindsay): Before William Henry Harrison became the country\\'s ninth president in 1841, he was governor of Indiana Territory. He lived at a home named Grouseland. Built in 1804, the home was reportedly dubbed Grouseland by Harrison due to the abundance of grouse in the area. The Georgian-Federal brick mansion was the first of its kind in Indiana and is now a National Historic Landmark. The house was more than a home; it was the center of government for the territory and was a fortress in times of unrest. The home now is a presidential site and contains artifacts from the first modern presidential campaign and the Battle of Tippecanoe. Vincennes, Knox County Visitors and Tourism BureauFullscreen Indiana Medical History Museum, Indianapolis (Adolph Scherrer): The Indiana Medical History Museum has been virtually untouched since it stopped operating as a pathology lab and teaching facility in the early 1960s. It was reborn as a museum in 1969. Built in 1896, it is oldest freestanding pathology facility in the nation. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, this 19-room facility is open to the public to tour and see scientific medicine of the 19th and 20th centuries. The building includes a 100-seat amphitheater, autopsy room, medical library and three clinical laboratories, all designed to support the study and research of mental disease. It is located on the grounds of the former Central State Hospital, originally known as the \\\\\"Indiana Hospital for the Insane\\\\\" which opened in 1848. Visit IndyFullscreen Indiana State Capitol, Indianapolis (Edwin May\\\\/Aldolph Scherrer): Made of Indiana limestone and Indiana-sourced oak and designed in classical Renaissance Revival style, the architecture of the Indiana Statehouse was influenced by the national Capitol. As architecturally beautiful as it is functional, the interior is marked by a stained-glass rotunda, marble floors and steps, granite columns, an ornate balcony and a period wall. The building was completed in 1888 and is one of the few capitol buildings that hosts all three branches of state government. Visit IndyFullscreen Indianapolis Museum of Art and 100 Acres (Ambrose Richardson\\\\/Browning Day Mullins Dierdorf): Encompassing 152 acres of gardens and grounds, the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) is among the 10 largest and 10 oldest encyclopedic art museums in the United States, and features significant collections of African, American, Asian, European and contemporary art. In June 2010, IMA launched The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art & Nature Park: 100 Acres to wide critical acclaim and it has been hailed across the United States as a new model for site-responsive sculpture parks in the 21st century. It was designed by Marlon Blackwell. Among the backdrop of woodlands, wetlands and a 35-acre lake, 100 Acres is one of only a few sculpture parks in the U.S. dedicated to the ongoing commission of site-responsive art work. Visit IndyFullscreen Levi Coffin House, Fountain City: In 1839, Levi and Catharine Coffin built this Federal-style, eight-room, brick home as a safe haven for slaves as part of the Underground Railroad. It is estimated that more than 1,000 slaves reached safety. The house was referred to as \\\\\"The Grand Central Station of the Underground Railroad.\\\\\" It was designed so that most rooms had at least two ways out, there\\'s a spring-fed well in the basement for easy access of water, and storage garrets on the side of the rear room made for convenient hiding places. The Levi and Catharine Coffin Interpretive Center, designed by Synthesis Incorporated, opened in December 2016. Richmond Wayne County Convention & Tourism BureauFullscreen Monastery Immaculate Conception, Ferdinand (Victor Klutho): Known as the \\\\\"Castle on the Hill,\\\\\" the Monastery, founded in 1867, is home to one of the nation\\'s largest communities of Benedictine women. The distinctive, recently restored Romanesque dome rises 87 feet majestically over the tiny town of Ferdinand. The church features 89 angels, 16 of which are depicted on the stained-glass windows surrounding the dome. The church is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been designated an Official Project of Save America\\'s Treasures. Dubois County Visitors CenterFullscreen Peters-Margedant House, Evansville (William Wesley Peters): A group of local preservation advocates recently saved the beloved Peters-Margedant House, which was designed by a native son, William Wesley Peters. The young architect was Wright\\'s first Taliesin apprentice. In 1932, Peters took a two-year break, and returned to Evansville, where he designed this Usonian-style house. It was completed two years before Wright\\'s first Usoninan house appeared in Madison, Wis. The Peters-Margedant house shows that Peters internalized Wright\\'s philosophy of organic architecture and his thoughts on creating affordable homes. The home is only 552 square feet. An ad hoc group rallied to save the house from demolition, and in 2016, it was moved to the University of Evansville campus. Adam J GreenFullscreen St. Meinrad Archabbey, St. Meinrad (Adrian Wewer): This destination was founded by monks from Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland on March 21, 1854. It is now home to approximately 98 monks. It is named after a monk who died in 961. It is one of only two archabbeys in the United States and one of nine in the world. The community at St. Meinrad consists of men who dedicate their lives to prayer and work. They gather five times daily for community prayer. You can join the monks in prayer when you visit the Archabbey church. Spencer County Visitors BureauFullscreen SAMARA (John E. Christian House), West Lafayette (Frank Lloyd Wright): Completed in 1956, the SAMARA house - named for the winged seeds found in pinecones - represents a pristine example of Frank Lloyd Wright\\'s Usonian architecture and is one of the most complete Wright homes in the United States. He designed the house for Purdue University professor John E. Christian and his wife Kay, who lived in the house until 2015. It has been maintained with its original furnishings and is available for tours April through November. In 2015, it was designated as a National Historic Landmark. The John E. Christian HouseFullscreen Scottish Rite Cathedral, Indianapolis (George F. Schreiber): This cathedral is one of the largest Masonic buildings in the United States and has been described as one of the finest examples of Neo-Gothic architecture. It was built with every dimension (in feet) being evenly divisible by three (reflecting the three degrees in Freemasonry), with many being divisible by 33 (reflecting the degrees a member of the Scottish Rite can achieve). The cathedral was built in 1927 and was finished in 1929 at a cost of $2.5 million. Visit IndyFullscreen Tyson Temple, Versailles (James Tyson\\\\/Odle McGuire Shook): The Tyson Temple United Methodist Church was built in 1937 using concrete, stone, steel, terra cotta and brick but zero nails, just as the building of Israel\\'s Tabernacle. The only wood to be found in the church is in the furnishings. James Tyson built it in honor of his mother, Eliza. The ceiling is the same blue of a cloudless sky and dotted with stars to mimic the constellations seen on the night his mother died. The inverted cone, open-work cast aluminum spire was one of the only two in the country at the same time of its construction. Lee LewellenFullscreen West Baden Springs Hotel, French Lick (Harrison Albright): Called the \\\\\"Eighth Wonder of the World\\\\\" when it opened in 1902, West Baden Springs Hotel had the largest free-spanning dome in the world. It also drew celebrities, dignitaries and even mobsters, who came for the \\\\\"miracle waters\\\\\" thought to be found in the natural sulfur springs. After falling on hard times after the stock market crash, West Baden was saved through a massive preservation effort, reopening in 2007 to its original grandeur. Chris SmithFullscreen Arts United Center, Fort Wayne (Louis Kahn): In the early 1960s, the Fine Arts Foundation expressed a bold vision to provide a permanent home for local member arts organizations. They sought out architect Louis Kahn, known for his monolithic, monumental, mid-century designs. Kahn\\'s arrangement for the venue was to provide a sense of importance of the events which occurred within it. The play of natural light through the interior spaces gives the building a sense of poetry, life and grandeur. Kahn was the distinguished guest and lecturer at the opening week for the theater in 1973. It is his last completed venue prior to his death in 1974; it\\'s also his only project in the Midwest, and his only design of a performing arts theater. Visit Fort WayneFullscreenLike this topic?

Negar TabibianFullscreen Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Baltimore: The first Roman Catholic cathedral constructed in the United States, the Baltimore Basilica was designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe, the architect of the United States Capitol building. Designed in a monumental, Neoclassical style, the basilica features a traditional Latin cross plan and central dome. An extensive renovation in 2006 by John G. Waite Associates restored the interior to Latrobe\\'s design and opened the labyrinthine crypt to the public. After a 2011 earthquake damaged the basilica, architects Cho Benn Holback + Associates oversaw repairs. AIAFullscreen Washington Monument and Mount Vernon Place, Baltimore: Baltimore\\'s magisterial Washington Monument was designed by architect Robert Mills after winning a design competition in 1814. The monument predates Mills\\' better-known Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. He chose to perch a statue of Washington on top of a massive Roman Doric column, tall enough to mark the Baltimore skyline for ships sailing in from the Chesapeake Bay. An elite residential community developed around the monument with park squares laid out from each cardinal point of the monument. Mount Vernon Place today is a treasure of upscale 19th-century townhomes. The park squares remain a destination and visitors can climb to the top of the Washington Monument once again thanks to the renovation work of architect Sandra Vicchio & Assoc. LLC.

Working with the late architect Charles Gwathmey sparked our love for modernist architecture, which we considered to work beautifully in concert with avant-garde art, while a collaboration with landscape architects Peter Walker and Partners allowed us to gently reshape, reconceive, and restore this 200-acre former foxhunting estate into an ideal setting for quiet aesthetic contemplation.\\\\\" Scott FrancesFullscreen Greenbelt Community Center: Greenbelt is one of three greenbelt towns envisioned by Rexford Guy Tugwell, friend and adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was created under the Resettlement Administration in 1935 under authority of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act. The architecture was streamlined in the Art Deco style popular at that time -- with curving lines, glass brick inserts in the facades of apartment buildings, and buttresses along the front wall of the elementary school. These buttresses create vertical lines framing a set of bas reliefs by WPA sculptor Lenore Thomas. The Greenbelt Community Center is considered one of the 10 best structures in Art Deco style within the United States. Beverly Palau, City of GreenbeltFullscreen Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission Headquarters, Riverdale: The building was erected in 1967 and designed by local architect Edwin Ball. In elevation, the pristine parallelepiped features the strong horizontal rhythms and floor divisions, as well as the minimalist structural decor, characteristic of suburban office structures in the late International style. The layout of the upper office floors is dictated by the presence of a striking fully glazed ring corridor. The exterior appears more monumental than its actual dimensions and triggers a powerful, yet subtle, visual impact due to its simplicity, elegance, harmonious proportions and impression of lightness. It was also one of the first public buildings in the area to incorporate accessibility features for the disabled. Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning CommissionFullscreen Music Center at Strathmore, North Bethesda: In April of 2001, a long-time dream was realized when Strathmore broke ground on a new 1,976-seat concert hall and education center -- the Music Center at Strathmore. Architects William Rawn Associates Architects, Inc., in association with Grimm + Parker Architects, along with acousticians Kirkegaard Associates and theater designers Theatre Project Consultants -- the same team that designed Seiji Ozawa Hall at Tanglewood for the Boston Symphony Orchestra -- joined together to create a 1,976-seat concert space that is warm, embracing and acoustically superb. Alan KarchmerFullscreen Point of Rocks Train Station: The Point of Rocks station was completed in 1876 and designed by architect E. Francis Baldwin who would construct a number of stations and depots for the B&O Railroad, particularly along the eastern areas of the railroad. The Point of Rocks station is likely the most well-known B&O station as it is heralded as one of, if not the, most photographed railroad stations in the country. The station\\'s popularity lies as much with its splendor as its location. The station is situated at the point where two railroad lines converge and its steeple faces directly towards where the railroad tracks meet, making it a truly magnificent setting.

The two-story brick Georgian-style structure was designed by Joseph Horatio Anderson. It holds the distinction of being capped by the largest wooden dome in the United States constructed without nails, as well as a lantern capped by a lightning rod built and grounded according to the direct specifications of its inventor, Benjamin Franklin. From Nov. 26, 1783, to Aug. 13, 1784, Annapolis was the capital of the United States, and provided the meeting place for the Congress of the Confederation. It was in the Old Senate Chamber that George Washington famously resigned his commission as commander in chief of the Continental Army on Dec. 23, 1783. The current building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960, and is the third statehouse on its site. Martin FalbisonerFullscreen Queen Anne\\'s County Courthouse, Centreville: The heart of Centreville is defined by the historic public square, which retains a late 18th-century courthouse that still houses county government functions. Construction of the original building was completed in 1796, and it remains the oldest courthouse still in use in the state of Maryland. Reconstructed in 1876, the exterior of the courthouse is virtually the same as it was when it was originally constructed. A gold eagle embedded in the pediment of the main portion of the building reflects the patriotism of the county\\'s early citizens. Leon ReedFullscreen United States Naval Academy, Annapolis: Home to the second-oldest of the nation\\'s five service academies, the United States Naval Academy is a National Historic Landmark and home to many historic buildings and monuments. Notable among them is the Naval Academy Chapel designed by Ernest Flagg and dedicated in 1908. In 1913, the remains of naval commander John Paul Jones were interred in the crypt beneath the chapel inside an elaborate sarcophagus made of 21 short tons of molten steel. visitannapolis.orgFullscreen Also designed by architect Ernest Flagg is Bancroft Hall, the largest building at the academy and the largest college dormitory in the world.

It was the first building in the world to receive the U.S. Green Building Council\\'s Platinum rating for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), and is a model for energy efficiency, high performance and water conservation. Clad in galvanized siding made of recycled metal, the headquarters uses 10% of the potable water and 30% of the energy of a typical office building. It features materials made of recycled products, renewable resources, passive and active solar panels, water conservation of up to 90%, and optimal use of natural ventilation. It serves as an interactive model that educates and inspires businesses, organizations, government agencies and visitors. Flickr\\\\/theregenerationFullscreen Cove Point Lighthouse, Lusby: Situated on a 7-acre point of land in one of the narrowest parts of the Chesapeake Bay, this iconic beacon remains an active aid to navigation, and is the oldest continuously operating lighthouse on the Chesapeake Bay. Prominent lighthouse builder John Donahoo erected a brick conical tower in 1828 following a plan he had used at several other sites in the bay. The property includes a keeper\\'s house which was enlarged in 1881, and again in 1925. A wooden shed was built in 1902 to house a foghorn, and its roof is capped by a fog bell from 1837. The foghorn equipment was moved in 1950 to a separate brick building, but the fog bell remains on the shed. The keepers remained until 1986, when the light was finally automated.

Prior to the first Spanish visitors in 1540, Taos Pueblo was a center of trade between the native populations along the Rio Grande and their Plains Tribes neighbors to the northeast. The pueblo\\'s culture continues to thrive, showing many similarities to the Ancestral Puebloans of pre-Hispanic contact. In 1992, Taos Pueblo was designated a UNESCO\\\\/World Heritage Site. David MuenchFullscreen Spaceport America Terminal Hanger Facility, 2011-2014 (Architect: Foster + Partners, working with URS Corporation and SMPC Architects): The Spaceport America Gateway to Space Terminal Hangar Facility in Truth or Consequences is a combined terminal and hangar facility that serves as the base for Virgin Galactic\\'s spaceflight operations. The round building form and apron reflect their brand, an \\\\\"iris,\\\\\" viewed from space. To preserve the El Camino Real view shed, the undulating roof and berms, which mimic the rolling hills and colors of this high desert plain, reduce its apparent scale and shroud it with a veil of mystery. Organized into a highly efficient and rational plan, the Terminal Hanger Facility is designed to relate to the dimensions of the spacecraft. There\\'s a careful balance between accessibility and privacy. Astronaut areas and visitor spaces are integrated with the rest of the building to convey the thrill of space travel. More sensitive zones - such as the control room - are visible, but have limited access. SMPC ArchitectsFullscreen San Francisco de Asis Mission Church, 1816 (Architect: Spanish Colonial Franciscan Priests): Completed in 1816, the San Francisco de Asis Mission Church in Ranchos de Taos is a large, sculpted Spanish Colonial church with massive adobe buttresses and two front-facing bell towers. The architecture of the church is an impressive blend of native and Spanish styles. Three white crosses adorn the two towers and church entranceway. Four \\\\\"beehive\\\\\"-shaped buttresses support the back of the church structure and two buttresses in front of each bell tower support the front. Inside the church, stairs lead to a choir loft above the entrance. The large sanctuary provides ample space for worshippers and visitors, and the altar is decorated with original Spanish woodworking and religious iconography. A thick adobe wall surrounds the church, cemetery and forecourt. Travis K. WittFullscreen KiMo Theater, 1927 (Architect: Carl Boller): One of Albuquerque\\'s historic landmarks, the KiMo Theater is a Pueblo Deco picture theater that merges the spirit of the Native American cultures of the Southwest with the exuberance of Art Deco. KiMo, in the language of the nearby Isleta Pueblo, means \\\\\"king of its kind,\\\\\" and the name is certainly well-deserved. Its exterior is finished with strongly textured light brown stucco embellished with ornamental details of glazed terra cotta tile and vividly colored reliefs. The interior decorations, symbols and colors were chosen to link the theater to the local Native American Pueblo culture. Seven large oil paint murals by Carl Von Hassler complete the theaters d\\\\u00e9cor, representing the Seven Cities of Cibola. The KiMo is currently celebrating the 90th anniversary of its opening. Mitchell TillisonFullscreen Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi, 1886 (Architect: Archbishop Jean Baptiste Lamy): The church is commonly known as Saint Francis Cathedral, and is a Roman Catholic cathedral in downtown Santa Fe. The cathedral was built by Archbishop Jean Baptiste Lamy between 1869 and 1886 on the site of an older adobe church. Influenced by the French-born Archbishop Lamy and in dramatic contrast to the surrounding adobe structures, Saint Francis Cathedral was designed in the Romanesque Revival style. As such, the cathedral features characteristic round arches separated by Corinthian columns and truncated square towers. The large rose window in front and those in the lateral nave windows were imported from Clermont-Ferrand in France. The towers were originally planned to be topped with dramatic 160-foot steeples, but due to lack of funds, these were never built. The left tower is a single row of bricks taller than the right tower. The cathedral was built from yellow limestone blocks quarried locally. Charles WollertzFullscreen Georgia O\\'Keeffe House and Studio, 1734, 1900ss expansion, 1949 expansion (Architect: Montoya Family; Chavez Family; Maria Chabat and Georgia O\\'Keeffe): The original house of the Montoya family was a single line of rooms that was extended by the Chavez family in the mid-19th century to create an enclosed courtyard. When O\\'Keeffe first visited Abiqui\\\\u00fa in 1934, the adobe walls were in ruins. O\\'Keeffe was enchanted by the south side of the courtyard. In 1945, O\\'Keeffe purchased the house from the Archdiocese of Santa Fe. From 1946 until 1949, O\\'Keeffe and Maria Chabot restored and expanded the ruined house to reflect her interests in nature, Modernism and Japanese aesthetics. Georgia O\\'Keeffe lived in this adobe house overlooking the Chama River valley, a high desert landscape that was featured in some of her most famous paintings. O\\'Keeffe\\'s house and studio both expressed her personal identity and represented her public persona as an artist who embodied the place in which she lived. Georgia O\\'Keeffe MuseumFullscreen Bart Prince Residence and Studio, 1984, 1990 Library Tower addition; 2006 Gallery addition (Architect: Bart Prince): Bart Prince, an Albuquerque architect known for his quirky and eclectic design aesthetic, didn\\'t disappoint when it came to designing his personal residences and studio. Located in Albuquerque\\'s thriving Nob Hill district, the house is located on a modest site. Thoughtful design and strategic placement provides privacy and passive solar benefits. The dwelling is still occupied by the architect himself, and is not open to the public; although the dramatic form can be viewed from the street. Bart PrinceFullscreen Acoma Pueblo, 1100 (Architect: Ancestral Puebloans): Acoma Pueblo is built atop a 365-foot sheer-walled mesa (table top) in a valley surrounded with amazing rock formations. Since 1150 A.D., Acoma Pueblo has earned the reputation as the oldest continuously inhabited community in North America. In 1629, construction began on the San Esteban del Rey Mission, a Spanish Catholic mission church. Both the mission and the pueblo are Registered National Historical Landmarks and are on the National Register of Historic Places. The beautiful Sky City Cultural Center and Haa\\'ku Museum, designed by Barbara Felix Architecture and Design in 2007, highlight Acoma\\'s living history and culture. Kevin FlemmingFullscreen Earthships, 1970s (Architect: Michael Reynolds): The designs for the Earthships in Taos were pioneered by the architect Michael Reynolds in the early 1970s. An Earthship is a type of passive solar house that is made of both natural and upcycled materials such as earth-packed tires. An Earthship addresses six principles or human needs: 1) Thermal\\\\/solar heating and cooling, 2) solar and wind electricity, 3) contained sewage treatment, 4) building with natural and recycled materials, 5) water harvesting, and 6) food production. Earthships are intended to be \\\\\"off-the-grid ready\\\\\" homes, with minimal reliance on public utilities and fossil fuels. They are constructed to use available natural resources, especially energy from the sun and rain water. They are designed with thermal mass construction and natural cross-ventilation to regulate indoor temperature. The design is intentionally simple, so that people with little building knowledge can construct one. Mueller FelixFullscreen BNSF Railyards, 1914-1925 (Architect: E.A. Harrison; C.F.W. Felt; A.F. Robinson; Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad): Once an integral symbol of the industrial age in Albuquerque, the former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Rail Yards complex still stands proudly on the southeastern edge of the city. This historic structure, now almost 100 years old, once employed one-quarter of Albuquerque\\'s work force. It was a hub of industrial activity. The major structures are the Fire Station (1920), the Storehouse (1915), now the Wheels Museum, the Transfer Table (1922), the Boiler Shop (1923) and the Machine Shop (1921). The Railyards are a cluster of industrial architecture designed to meet the needs of railroad operations. The vaulted steel structured ceilings, green and yellow stained windows, and industrial architecture offer an incredible atmosphere. The BNSF rail line to the east continues to carry freight and passenger traffic. Marc Gutierrez PhotographyFullscreen Chaco Canyon Cultural Historic National Park, 860 - 1150 (Architect: Ancestral Puebloans): Chaco Canyon Cultural Historic National Park contains one of the most important, complex and monumental Pre-Columbian landscapes in North America. Chaco Canyon is filled with numerous structures that include houses, kivas, mound, pyramids, ramps and stairs. This network was connected by a system of aligned roadways that extended to outlying settlements. The architecture of Chaco Canyon forms an integrated landscape that was planned and then constructed over several centuries in multiple phases. Some of the most renowned sites include Chetro Ketl (the great house), Casa Rinconada (the great kiva) and Pueblo Bonita (beautiful town). Because of its significance, Chaco Canyon was designated a National Monument in 1907 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. Wikimedia Commons\\\\/John WileyFullscreen El Santuario de Chimayo, 1816 (Architect: Don Bernardo Abeyta): During Holy Week, thousands of pilgrims can be seen walking through Northern New Mexico, making their way to this important Catholic site. Located in a small community nestled in the Sangre de Christo Mountains is a beautiful Spanish Colonial church, known for its long tradition of miraculous healings. People of faith and architectural enthusiasts have been visiting the site for over 200 years. William ArandaFullscreen Plaza Hotel, 1882 (Architect: T.J. Raywood): The Plaza Hotel is a hotel in Las Vegas and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was opened as an upmarket hotel for the booming town in 1882. Land baron Benigno Romero and his friends decided Las Vegas needed a first-class hotel, so in 1881 they rounded up the cash and built the Plaza Hotel. Construction cost $25,000. It was advertised as the finest hotel in the territory and was often called the \\\\\"Belle of the Southwest.\\\\\" The hotel looks just like it did when built - a grand Victorian fa\\\\u00e7ade with three floors of 14-foot ceilings and huge windows overlooking the Plaza, topped like a wedding cake with fanciful scrolls. Originally there were 37 guest rooms, a saloon, dance hall and restaurant. Matching walnut staircases wind elegantly from the lobby to all floors. Then and now everyone stayed here, from Doc Holliday to Tommy Lee Jones. The Plaza Hotel has starred in movies and TV, from Tom Mix silent pictures to \\\\\"Longmire,\\\\\" \\\\\"Easy Rider\\\\\" and \\\\\"No Country for Old Men.\\\\\" The Plaza building had an award winning million-dollar renovation by Wid Slick in 1982. Mitchell TillisonFullscreen George Pearl Hall, 2008 (Architect: Antoine Predock In Association with Executive Architect Jon Anderson): George Pearl Hall houses the UNM School of Architecture and Planning and the Fine Arts Library and was completed in 2008. Named after a local architect and donor to the School of Architecture, George Pearl Hall brings into the 21st century the long-standing debate over how the University of New Mexico should balance the competing interests of antiquity and modernity when representing itself as the state\\'s flagship institution of higher learning. Located on Central Avenue, along the university\\'s southern edge, the building fits tightly into its rectangular site, but unfolds in elevation into interwoven planes, spaces and volumes that demonstrate complex relationships of plan to section, challenge the conventions of functional programming, and expose the building\\'s structure and mechanical systems. Gregory PetersonFullscreen Fuller Lodge, 1928 (Architect: John Gaw Meem): Completed in 1928, Fuller Lodge originally served as a gathering place for the boys attending the Los Alamos Ranch School. It was a grand rustic structure in which massive load-bearing vertical logs supported contrasting horizontal logs comprising the intervening spandrels. Meem personally hand-selected the 771 massive pine trees used to build the structure. With a great portico lining its east fa\\\\u00e7ade and exposed decorative log trusses framing the interior dining room, the building suggests a design versatility, sometimes overlooked, that Meem demonstrated at the start of his career. In late 1942, the building and surrounding area was purchased by the U.S. Army for the Manhattan Project, providing housing for visiting scientists, post and technical personnel, with its large Pajarito Room serving as a cafeteria. The lodge underwent an extensive, multi-million dollar restoration project completed last year to restore this gem in the heart of downtown Los Alamos, including restoration of the east patio to its original form and unearthing the stone steps that had been part of the original structure during the Ranch School. Fuller Lodge is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and registered as a New Mexico Cultural Property. L. BucklinFullscreen Gila Cliff Dwellings, 1200 (Architect: Ancestral Puebloans): The Gila Cliff Dwellings were built by ancestors of Puebloan people who once lived in the Mogollon area. The 533-acre national monument was established by President Theodore Roosevelt through executive proclamation on Nov. 16, 1907, to protect the prehistoric architecture known at the time as the Gila Hot Springs Cliff-Houses. The namesake ruins\\' developers made use of natural caves to build interlinked dwellings within five cliff alcoves above Cliff Dweller Canyon. The TJ Ruins are located on a bluff overlooking the Gila River. The Mogollon Peoples are believed to have inhabited the region from between 1275 and into the early 14th century, during the Pueblo III Era. Archaeologists have identified 46 rooms in the five caves on Cliff Dweller Canyon, and believe they were occupied by 10 to 15 families. The \\\\\"Heart-Bar Site\\\\\" or the TJ Ruins (named for the former ranch which the mesa takes its name from) located on TJ Mesa are largely un-excavated. Chris DodsonFullscreen La Fonda Hotel, 1922, 1929 renovation and addition, 2013 renovation (Architect: Rapp, Rapp and Hendrickson; John Gaw Meem with Mary Colter; Barbara Felix Architecture and Design): The La Fonda Hotel is a Spanish-Pueblo, or Santa Fe-style, hotel that sits diagonally across the Santa Fe Plaza from the New Mexico Museum of Art. La Fonda helped popularize the image of both Santa Fe and New Mexico as a tourist destination by applying this style to the commercial needs of a luxury hotel. The hotel featured stepped and terraced elevations, irregular sculpted parapets, a three-story bell tower, wooden posts topped by corbel capitals and square beams, and projecting vigas. The interior continues the style with an eclectic mix of exposed wood-beam ceilings, colorful tiled floors, tinwork chandeliers, Mission-style wooden furniture, Navajo blankets and Pueblo pottery. In 2012-2013, the La Fonda underwent a major renovation. Elements that had been removed or altered after the hotel was sold in 1968 were restored. The restoration marked the return of cast-iron chandeliers to the hotel lobby. Carpeting was removed to expose colored concrete tile floors installed by Meem and Colter, and original headboards were refurbished and reproduced. Ash CookFullscreen Loretto Chapel, 1878 (Architect: Antoine Mouly): In 1872 Jean-Baptiste Lamy, the Bishop of the Santa Fe Archdiocese, commissioned the building of a convent chapel to be named Our Lady of Light Chapel, which would be in the care of the Sisters of Loretto. The chapel was designed by French architect Antoine Mouly in the Gothic Revival style, complete with spires, buttresses and stained glass windows imported from France. Although it was built on a much smaller scale, the chapel bears an obvious resemblance to Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. The former Roman Catholic church is now used as a museum and wedding chapel. It is known for its unusual wooden helix-shaped spiral staircase that has no nails or hardware in its construction. Theodore BlackburnFullscreen Los Poblanos Historic Inn and Organic Farm, 1932, 2010 addition (Architect: John Gaw Meem; Moule & Polyzoides Architects & Urbanists): The buildings at Los Poblanos in Los Ranchos de Albuquerque were designed by famed architect John Gaw Meem, widely considered New Mexico\\'s greatest 20th-century architect and whose name is synonymous with Santa Fe style. Meem, famous for combining traditional regional architecture and 20th-century sensibilities, inspired New Mexico\\'s classic style, known as Territorial Revival. Set among 25 acres of lavender fields, enormous cottonwood trees and lush formal gardens, Los Poblanos is one of the most magnificent historic properties in the Southwest. In addition to the architecture, Meem and the Simms contracted some of New Mexico\\'s leading artists and craftsmen of the period to create artwork for the building. There is a true fresco by Peter Hurd, carved doors and mantels by Gustave Baumann, tinwork by Robert Woodman, ironwork by Walter Gilbert, photography by Laura Gilpin, and the landscape architecture by the famed Rose Greely. Judson RhodesFullscreen Palace of the Governors, 1610 (Architect: Don Pedro de Peralta): Located on the northern border of the famous Santa Fe Plaza, the Palace of the Governors is the oldest continuously occupied structure in the United States. Originally home to the first Spanish Governor (1610), the building has also been inhabited by Pueblo Indians, the seat of U.S. Territory governors, and currently a museum. The Palace of the Governors is open to the public and features many displays that depict the buildings past. Asaavedra32Fullscreen Bandelier National Monument, 1350-1941 (Architect: Ancestral Puebloans): Bandelier National Monument protects over 33,000 acres of rugged canyon and mesa country as well as evidence of a human presence going back over 11,000 years. Petroglyphs, dwellings carved into the rock cliffs and standing masonry walls pay tribute to a culture that still survives in the surrounding communities. The monument is also home to several buildings and spaces designed by the National Park Service Architects and Landscape Architects. Lillian MakedaFullscreen Rio Grande Nature Center, 1982 (Architect: Antoine Predock): The Rio Grande Nature Center is a 166-acre nature preserve on the Bosque, an ecosystem of river, sand flats, floodplain, wetlands, cottonwoods and wildlife. Established when Albuquerque\\'s open lands were fast disappearing during a time of rapid growth, the center is concealed behind a high earthen berm. Burrowing from the earth, a galvanized steel culvert leads inside to a circular structure of cast-in-place concrete. Seen almost entirely from the inside, the building is a bird blind that hides itself from our view and camouflages the presence of visitors. The expected architectural view of the building\\'s curved concrete facade on the pond is in an area off limits to visitors, only to be seen by the birds. New Mexico State ParksFullscreen Santa Fe Opera House, 1997 (Architect: James Polshek and Partners, with Jack Purcell (acoustics)): The Santa Fe Opera is the only open-air opera house in the United States. The current Crosby Theatre is the third rebuilding of the theater, standing in the retained footprint of the previous buildings. The arch-shaped theater is situated within a basin with natural acoustic properties. The current evolution retains the concepts of the original designs that responded to the contours of the landscape, natural acoustics of the basin, and an open-air theater. Cable-suspended mezzanines and stage-level roofs mark a dramatic exploration of structure. The theater commands a panoramic view of the Jemez Mountains to the west and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the east. The Santa Fe Opera is open for an annual summer season that runs from mid-June until August. Ken HowardFullscreen Spencer Theater for the Performing Arts, 1997 (Architect: Antoine Predock): The Spencer Theater for the Performing Arts in Ruidoso is sited in the middle of the Fort Stanton Mesa, between Sunset peak on the east horizon and the Sierra Blanca peaks to the west, along the axis of the summer sun. Sierra Blanca, meaning \\\\\"white mountain,\\\\\" became the initial conceptual idea for the building\\'s form and cladding. The wedge-like, white limestone form suggests a massive stone that has forced its way up from the earth. Expanding from a crevice on the north side is a faceted glass shell of the entry and theater lobbies. Once on the upper level there is a reorientation to the eastern view from an exterior gathering space. The west end of the structure focuses on a geometric garden from a recessed exterior stage platform. A covered drop-off zone penetrates the wedge north to south, providing an all-weather entry. Mark StambaughFullscreen Zimmerman Library, 1938, 1967 addition, 1976 addition, 1993 renovation (Architect: John Gaw Meem; Ferguson Stevens Mallory & Pearl; Dean, Hunt, Kruger & Associates; Van H. Gilbert Architect, PC): Renowned local architect John Gaw Meem was commissioned to design an iconic architectural focal point for the University of New Mexico campus. Inspired by the local pueblo buildings, Gaw Meem created a Spanish Pueblo-style building which to this day remains the main university library and a historic treasure for UNM staff, students and faculty. The building is open to the public. Steven R. HarrisFullscreenLike this topic?

The roof, the air conditioning, the skyboxes, the electronic signs and the concessions were all conceived to create an experience that would draw people away from their televisions and the comforts of their homes. The building brought professional sports to Houston and was instrumental in putting an end to Jim Crow-era segregation. Flickr\\\\/Ed SchipulFullscreen The San Antonio Missions National Historical Park (architects unknown): Everybody knows the Alamo, but there are four other 18th-century Spanish missions in San Antonio: Mission Concepcion (1731), Mission San Jose (1720), Mission San Juan Capistrano (1716) and Mission Espada (1731). Mark MenjivarFullscreen More than just historical monuments, these missions are still run by the Catholic Archdiocese and continue to provide Mass and other services for the faithful. Mark MenjivarFullscreen Fair Park, Dallas (George Dahl, architect): Built in 1936 for the Texas Centennial Exposition, and now home to the Texas State Fair, this 277-acre recreational and educational park is directly south of downtown Dallas. Carolyn BrownFullscreen Many of the original Art Deco buildings have been restored and are still in use. Carolyn BrownFullscreen The Bishop\\'s Palace, Galveston (Nicholas J. Clayton, architect): Completed in 1893 for prominent Galveston lawyer and politician James Gresham, and later sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese as a residence for Bishop Christopher E. Byrne, the Bishop\\'s Palace is a masterpiece of Gulf Coast Victorian architecture. The heavy, stone structure survived the Great Hurricane of 1900 while sheltering several hundred survivors. Nick SaumFullscreen Little Chapel in the Woods, Denton (O\\'Neal Ford and Arch B. Swank, Jr., architects): This little wedding chapel on the campus of Texas Woman\\'s University is a prime example of Texas regional modernism by the master of the genre. Elizabeth HacklerFullscreen Completed in 1939, the project combines modernism\\'s straightforward geometry with local, natural materials -- brick and fieldstone -- that soften and humanize the overall effect. Alan RobertsFullscreen It was funded by student, faculty and alumnae donations and constructed mostly by unskilled student labor -- some of which was provided by the New Deal\\'s National Youth Administration. Alan G RobertsFullscreen Pennzoil Place, Houston (Johnson\\\\/Burgee Architects): Completed in 1975, developed by legendary Houston developer Gerald D. Hines and designed by Jonson\\\\/Burgee Architects, Pennzoil Place\\'s twinned, trapezoidal towers and sculptural form broke the rigor of the Miesian box and opened the doors for Postmodernism. The building led to Johnson winning the AIA Gold Medal in 1978 and the first-ever Pritzker Prize in Architecture in 1979. Ada Louise Huxtable proclaimed it the \\\\\"building of the decade.\\\\\" Flickr\\\\/urban.houstonianFullscreen NorthPark Center, Dallas (Harrell and Hamilton Architects (now Omniplan)): Dallas is Texas\\' flashiest city, and NorthPark is its swankiest shopping center. Developed by Raymond Nasher and completed in 1965, it was the largest shopping mall in the country when it opened and continues to be one of the most successful, taking in more than $1 billion in sales annually. The mall also is home to major works of art by the likes of James Rosenquist, Anthony Gormley, Mark de Suvero and more. Luke McKenzieFullscreen Suzanne Deal Booth Centennial Pavilion, Houston (Thomas Phifer and Partners, with artist James Turrell): This pavilion, located adjacent to the Shepherd School of Music on the Rice University campus, features James Turrell\\'s \\\\\"Twilight Epiphany\\\\\" sky space. The pyramidal structure is composed of grass, concrete, stone and steel, and continues the artist\\'s exploration of natural and artificial light as played through and across this sculpted lens. Experience this space at sunrise and sunset to enjoy both natural and designed light sequences. Casey DunnFullscreen Marienkirche, Fredericksburg (architects unknown): In the middle of the 19th century, thousands of German immigrants poured into Central Texas, many of them skilled craftsmen, intellectuals and political dissidents. These resourceful pioneers went to work adapting their traditions to the geography and climate of a still-wild land. Marienkirche, completed in 1863 of local materials -- limestone and cypress -- is a Gothic cathedral re-imagined in a frontier condition. AIAFullscreen Dallas City Hall (I.M. Pei & Partners with Harper & Kemp): In a bid to reinvent Dallas\\' image after the events of November 1963, then-mayor Erik Jonsson and a committee of prominent citizens commissioned I.M. Pei to design a new city hall and municipal center. Completed in 1978, the building was envisioned as an expression of civic pride, confidence and ambition; it features a modernist, inverted pyramid design that is as fresh and compelling today as it was when it was first completed. Sloping at a 34-degree angle, Dallas City Hall has seven above-grade floors, each 9.5 feet wider than the one below. David R TribbleFullscreen Fort Worth Water Gardens (Philip Johnson with John Burgee): Despite a number of tragedies that have occurred there since its opening in 1974, the Fort Worth Water Gardens, updated for safety, continues to captivate visitors. The park has been billed as both a serene, refreshing oasis at the southern edge of downtown, and as an architectural space where vertiginous tectonics are infused with the drama of water. The Gardens\\' biggest draw is the Active Pool, which allows people to descend a series of steps as water, cascading 38 meters to the structure\\'s center, rushes around them. The project also features a quiet, blue meditation pool, and an aerating pool with fountains. Flickr\\\\/RodneyFullscreen LBJ Presidential Library, Austin (Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, with Brooks, Barr, Graeber, and White): Designed in 1966 and completed in 1971, the 10-story monumental mass of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum, perched as it is on a generous, elevated plaza, is a modern Parthenon and Austin\\'s most heroic architectural expression. Thomas McConnellFullscreen Gordon Bunshaft said the inspiration for the design came from the strength he perceived in Johnson, the old Master of the Senate, who was then at the height of his presidential power -- hammering his Great Society legislation through Congress while becoming hopelessly mired in the Vietnam War. As a bonus, the museum features an animatronic LBJ! Thomas McConnellFullscreen Tower of the Americas, San Antonio (Ford Powell & Carson): Built as the theme structure for HemisFair \\'68, the Tower of the Americas is one of the few enduring landmarks from the international exposition that helped redefine San Antonio as a welcoming multicultural metropolis. Three exterior elevators stand ready to whisk visitors to the top of the 750-foot-tall tower, where they can enjoy an observation deck, lounge and revolving restaurant offering panoramic views of the city. AIAFullscreen The Menil Collection Houston (Renzo Piano Building Workshop with Richard Fitzgerald & Associates): Texas\\' other greatest museum of the 20th century (next to the Kimbell) opened in 1987. Carefully integrated within a neighborhood of bungalows, many of which are also part of the institution, Piano\\'s building had a profound influence on museum design in the following decades. The Menil campus includes other must-sees: the Rothko Chapel (Howard Barnstone and Eugene Aubrey, architects, 1971), the Cy Twombly Pavilion (Renzo Piano, 1992), the Byzantine Fresco Chapel (Francois de Menil, 1997) and the soon-to-be-completed Menil Drawing Institute (Johnston Marklee). Paul HesterFullscreen Ellis County Courthouse, Waxahachie (J. Riley Gordon, architect): With 254 counties, Texas has more historic county courthouses than any other state in the nation. This fine example in Ellis County, completed in 1896, designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, and constructed of granite and red sandstone, was completely restored by the Texas Historical Commission\\'s Courthouse Preservation Program in 2002. Flickr\\\\/Nicholas HendersonFullscreen Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth (Louis I. Kahn): Completed in 1972, the Kimbell is widely considered to be one of the world\\'s most significant works of modern architecture. Kahn managed to create a building that feels at once ancient and modern, monumental and intimate. The scale, materiality and ethereal quality of light -- a mix of indirect daylight washing the concrete vaults and incandescent down lighting -- are certainly not to be missed. It is located in Fort Worth\\'s cultural district, which is also home to the Philip Johnson-designed Amon Carter Museum of American Art, and the Tadao Ando-designed Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, which are both worth the trip on their own. Flickr\\\\/Kevin MuncieFullscreen World Birding Center, Mission (Lake|Flato Architects): Located in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, near the border with Mexico, the World Birding Center is of special significance today considering it is dedicated to the observation and appreciation of creatures for whom borders mean nothing. Lake|FlatoFullscreen Completed in 2004, the project is also a prime example of sustainable design and contemporary Texas vernacular. Lake|FlatoFullscreen Lake|Flato referenced both the agricultural infrastructure of the valley as well as the modern-primitive forms of Louis Kahn\\'s Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth. Lake|FlatoFullscreen Circuit of the Americas, Austin (Mir\\\\u00f3 Rivera Architects): The first purpose-built Formula 1 Grand Prix facility to ever be built in the United States is in Austin. Opened in 2010, Circuit of the Americas is more than a racetrack. It also includes an outdoor music venue called the Austin360 Amphitheater, a 251-foot-tall observation tower, and a grand landscaped plaza. Dorna SportsFullscreen Designed by local firm Mir\\\\u00f3 Rivera Architects, the public spaces and grandstands forgo old-hat Texana references in favor of an international language of speed based on the tubular construction and aerodynamic profiles of F1 cars. Merrick AlesFullscreen Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas (Renzo Piano Building Workshop with The Beck Group): Opened in 2003 right across the street from the Dallas Museum of Art, the Center began the realization of the city\\'s now thriving Arts District. This museum comprises a 55,000-square-foot building designed by Renzo Piano and a 2-acre garden by Peter Walker of PWP Landscape Architecture. It features rotating exhibitions from Patsy and Raymond Nasher\\'s collection of modern and contemporary masterpieces, and includes works from the likes of Matisse, Picasso, Rodin, Giacometti and Duchamp-Villon. Wikimedia Commons\\\\/Andreas PraefckeFullscreen The Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre, Dallas (Rem Koolhaas and Joshua Prince-Ramus): An integral part of the Dallas Arts District, this iconic theater opened in 2009 and forms part of the AT&T Performing Arts Center. Rather than locating front-of-house and back-of-house functions around the theater, the Wyly features a groundbreaking vertical \\\\\"stacked\\\\\" design that places these areas above and below. The fully flexible and reconfigurable theater chamber can be converted into virtually any type of performance space, giving the directors who work there tremendous amount of freedom to realize their vision. Craig BlackmonFullscreen Fountain Place, Dallas (I.M. Pei and Partners with landscape architect Dan Kiley): Since its completion in 1986, the late-modernist Fountain Place in downtown Dallas has been praised for both the geometry of its 60-story tower, which is clad in green glass, and the extraordinary 6-acre urban space at its base. The building\\'s various slanted sides cause it to have a completely different profile from every direction, and its plaza features 172 dancing fountains -- hence, its name. Craig BlackmonFullscreen Temple Emanu-El, Dallas (Howard Meyer and Max Sandfield): Following its completion in 1957, Temple Emanu-El was widely hailed as a brilliant alliance of architecture and art. Craig BlackmonFullscreen The temple, a cylindrical sanctuary with lofty walls and a shallow-domed ceiling, reflects an exquisite use of indigenous materials and contrasting illumination. It features glittery artwork by artists Gyorgy Kepes and Anni Albers, and courtyards and gardens designed by the acclaimed landscape architects Arthur and Marie Berger. Craig BlackmonFullscreen The Alley Theatre, Houston (Ulrich Franzen & Associates with Mackie & Kamrath): The Ulrich Franzen-designed home of Houston\\'s Alley Theatre has been a love-it-or-hate-it proposition from the start. With its fortress-like concrete exterior, the Brutalist building has been called \\\\\"one of the finest modern buildings in Houston,\\\\\" and one of its \\\\\"least photogenic.\\\\\" What is undeniable is that the architect\\'s flexible design responded brilliantly to the needs of the innovative theater company, providing the setting for almost 50 years of social and cultural interaction for the public. Gary ZvonkovicFullscreen Margarite B. Parker Chapel at Trinity University, San Antonio (Ford Powell & Carson in conjunction with Bartlett Cocke and Associates): Virtually unchanged since its completion in 1966, the Parker Chapel is a pink-brick Romanesque duomo located on the Trinity University campus. Ford Powell & CarsonFullscreen It is considered one of the finest examples of what makes O\\'Neil Ford\\'s work so special. Ford Powell & CarsonFullscreen Its honest expression of materials and the craftsmanship of its details makes the chapel feel like a grand space as it provides a serene place for worship and reflection. Ford Powell & CarsonFullscreen Barton Springs Pool, Austin: Perhaps the best building in Central Texas isn\\'t a building at all: it\\'s a natural, spring-fed swimming pool in the heart of downtown Austin. Barton Springs was considered sacred by the Tonkawas, was the site of Spanish missions in the 17th century, and has been a municipal swimming hole since the 1920s. With crystal-clear water that maintains an average temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit, the pool is a year-round destination for swimmers and is the crown jewel in Austin\\'s impressive system of greenbelts.

In 1945, a 100-acre rural tract was purchased by a cooperative of young couples from New York City, who enlisted Frank Lloyd Wright to build his Broadacre City concept. The layout of the neighborhood was planned by Wright in a circular manner, preserving most of the original trees and \\\\\"encouraging the flow of the land\\\\\". The balance of the homes was decreed to be in the modern \\\\\"organic\\\\\" style ordained by Wright. The community was named \\\\\"Usonia\\\\\" in homage to Wright, whose ideas on the way Americans should live together guided their plan.

AIAFullscreen New York State Capitol, Albany, 1899 (Architect: Thomas Fuller, FAIA, Leopold Eidlitz, FAIA, Henry Hobson Richardson, FAIA, Isaac G. Perry): Started in 1867 and completed in 1899, at a cost of $25 million (equivalent to $720 million in 2016), it was the most expensive government building of its time. The design encompassed various styles because of the replacement of architects during construction. The ground floor of the state capitol was built in the Classical\\\\/Romanesque style, when Lieutenant Governor William Dorsheimer dismissed Fuller in favor of Eidlitz and Richardson, who built the next two floors in a Renaissance Classical style, noticeable on the exterior two floors as light, open columnwork. The increasing construction costs became an ongoing source of conflict in the legislature, and it was difficult to secure the funding necessary. Eidlitz and Richardson were dismissed by Grover Cleveland upon his election to governorship. He then hired Perry to complete the project. The legislative chambers, the fourth floor and roof work were all finished in Victorian-modified Romanesque that was distinctively Richardson\\'s design, the dominate the final outcome of the grand building, which evolved into his distinguished Romanesque style. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, then included as a contributing property when the Lafayette Park Historic District was listed in 1978. The New York State Capitol was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1979.

David BridgesFullscreen Flatiron Building, NYC, 1902 (Architect: Daniel Hudson Burnham, FAIA): The Flatiron Building, originally the Fuller Building, is a triangular 22-story steel-framed landmarked building located at 175 Fifth Avenue. A groundbreaking skyscraper completed in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city at 20 floors high and one of only two skyscrapers north of 14th Street. The building sits on a triangular block formed by Fifth Avenue, Broadway and East 22nd Street, with 23rd Street grazing the triangle\\'s northern (uptown) peak. As with numerous other wedge-shaped buildings, the name \\\\\"Flatiron\\\\\" derives from its resemblance to a cast-iron clothes iron. The neighborhood around it is called the Flatiron District after its signature building. The Flatiron Building was designated a New York City landmark in 1966, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989. AIAFullscreen Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University, Ithaca, 1973 (Architect: I.M. Pei, FAIA): The Johnson Museum of Art was designed by I.M. Pei. It can be characterized by its fifth floor, which cantilevers over the open-air sculpture garden. It was designed so that it would not block the view of Cayuga Lake, and offers a panoramic view of the same from its north and west sides. It also houses a room for meetings on the sixth floor, which was used for many years by Cornell\\'s Board of Trustees. The unique location of the museum presented several architectural challenges: building space was limited, and it could not overwhelm the view of Cayuga Lake or the nearby Arts Quad. The building was awarded the American Institute of Architects Honor Award in 1975 and the building\\'s design also appeared on the cover of \\\\\"Scientific American\\\\\" as an early example of computer graphics. AIAFullscreen Hotel Lafayette, Buffalo, 1902 (Architect: Louise Blanchard Bethune): The Hotel Lafayette is a seven-story steel frame and concrete building designed in the French Renaissance style. It features decorative vitreous red brick and white terracotta trim. The original building was designed by the first female architect, Louise Blanchard Bethune (1856-1913), and built between 1902 and 1911. Additions from 1916-1917 and 1924-1926 were completed by Esenwein and Johnson. In its prime, it was considered one of the 15 finest hotels in the country. Luxuries included elevators and every room featured hot and cold water and a telephone. A $35 million rehabilitation project restored the hotel to its original beauty in 2012, and it now contains 92 one- and two-bedroom apartments, 57 hotel rooms, several bars, restaurants and banquet facilities. It is listed on the National Registry of Historic Places. James Cavanaugh, Copyright 2012 James CavanaughFullscreen Hall of Languages, Syracuse University, Syracuse, 1871 (Architect: Horatio Nelson White): The University building was designed by Horatio Nelson White in the Second Empire architectural style, and built in 1871-73. It is made of Onondaga limestone and features three large towers or cupolas. It was the first building constructed on the Syracuse University campus and the building originally housed the entire university. The iconic building has been prominently displayed as a representation of the university in many forums, most recently in 2010 when the Syracuse Orange men\\'s basketball team started wearing Nike jerseys that feature an aerographic of the Hall of Languages. The Hall of Languages is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. DASonnenfeldFullscreen New York Public Library Main Branch, Manhattan, 1911 (Architect: John Merven Carr\\\\u00e8re, FAIA and Thomas Hastings, FAIA): The flagship building in the New York Public Library system and a prominent historic landmark in Midtown Manhattan, it opened in 1911 and is one of four research libraries in the library system. It currently contains an area of 646,680 square feet and four stories open to public. The main entrance steps are on Fifth Avenue opposite East 41st Street. The Library\\'s famous Rose Main Reading Room is 78 by 297 feet with 52-foot-high ceilings. The room is lined with thousands of reference works on open shelves along the floor level and along the balcony, lit by massive windows and grand chandeliers, and furnished with sturdy wood tables, comfortable chairs, and brass lamps. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, and designated a New York City Landmark in 1967. AIAFullscreen The Mohonk Mountain House, New Paltz, 1869 (Architect: Napoleon Le Brun, FAIA, James Ware, FAIA, originally built by Quakers Albert and Alfred Smiley): The Mohonk Mountain House is a historic American resort hotel located on the Shawangunk Ridge in Ulster County. Its prominent location in the town of New Paltz is just beyond the southern border of the Catskill Mountains, west of the Hudson River. Begun in the 1870s as a small resort for family and friends by the Smiley brothers, it became so popular that it was enlarged many times. Because of the Smileys\\' love of the outdoor life, the area around the hotel was treated as an integral part of the attractions of the resort. Much of this area was planned as an experiment in conservation of the natural environment, and as an educational tool for the study of botany, geology and outdoor living. Mohonk Mountain House is a National Historic Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places and a member of Historic Hotels of America. kotobuki711Fullscreen MoMA (Museum of Modern Art), NYC, 1937 (Architect: Edward Durell Stone, FAIA, & Philip L. Goodwin, FAIA, remodel by Philip Johnson, FAIA, & Yoshio Taniguchi): The Museum of Modern Art, or MoMA, is an art museum located in Midtown Manhattan on 53rd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.

The center houses a collection of exhibits that illustrate and celebrate his lifelong fight for equality and social justice for the common man, and the facility beautifully embodies the energy of his non-wavering belief and faith in the human spirit. The building\\'s lower portion relates to the 19th-century context of the surrounding buildings, and the upper mass reaches skyward. The roof \\\\\"lifts off\\\\\" from a lower center ridge and caps a glass-enclosed sixth floor, recalling Ali\\'s famous quote, \\\\\"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. Your hands can\\'t hit what your eyes can\\'t see.\\\\\" The torch carried by Muhammad Ali at the 1996 Olympics is depicted on the building\\'s south side by a three-story cone made of copper-hued aluminum panels, and an elliptical staircase within provides the connection to exhibition floors. The main feature of the exterior, a \\\\\"wrapper\\\\\" of 1-foot by 2-foot ceramic tiles in nine different colors, covers all four sides of the building. The wrapper appears from the entry plaza as an abstract pattern but resolves itself into images of Ali when viewed from a distance on highway I-64. AIAFullscreen Bernheim Arboretum & Research Forest Visitors Center - Clermont (William McDonough + Partners, with Barnette Bagley Architects): The first Hospitality LEED Platinum Certification in Kentucky, this design award-winning structure is so \\\\\"green\\\\\" that it is almost edible! A simple post-and-beam structure of sustainably harvested and reclaimed woods -- including salvaged pickle barrels and decommissioned bourbon barrels -- echoes the rhythms of the trees and frames views of the surrounding landscape designed by the Olmsted brothers in 1929. Like the forest of which it\\'s a part, the building captures light, water and air to the benefit of the surrounding landscape. Much of the roof is vegetated, producing oxygen and absorbing rainwater. Ponds collect rainwater for reuse and provide visual, acoustic and thermal comfort. Geothermal heating and cooling creates a quiet environment and connects the building to the earth, and photovoltaics produce energy on site. AIAFullscreen Blue Heron Mining Community\\\\/Big South Fork Coal Camp - Stearns (Chrisman, Miller, Woodford, Inc.): Hundreds of people lived in this coal mining community between 1937 and 1962. It was \\\\\"re-created\\\\\" in the 1980s as an outdoor museum with open, metal shells of the original buildings, referred to as \\\\\"ghost structures.\\\\\" Each structure is themed around a different aspect of life in the community such as school, church or woman\\'s life, and each contains an audio program through which the people who actually lived and worked in Blue Heron can share their memories and feelings about their life there. In addition to the audio program, each structure contains an exhibit case housing photographs and common everyday items which are relevant to the building\\'s theme. Recognized with AIA state and national awards for design excellence. AIAFullscreen Conrad Caldwell House Museum - Louisville (Charles Julian Clarke & Arthur Loomis Architects): The Conrad-Caldwell House Museum is one of the finest examples of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture, and arguably the finest of many distinctive Louisville landmarks by famed local architect Arthur Loomis. This impressive facility anchors the picturesque St. James Court - a beautiful courtyard neighborhood at the center of the largest collection of Victorian homes in the U.S. \\\\\"Conrad\\'s Castle\\\\\" featured all the latest innovations of its day, including interior plumbing and electric lighting, and it is well-known for its elaborate stone designs, stunning interior woodwork and magnificent stained glass windows. AIAFullscreen Four Roses Distillery - Lawrenceburg (Joseph & Joseph Architects): Built in 1910 and featuring a unique Spanish Mission-style architecture rarely seen in Kentucky, Four Roses Distillery is one of the most beautiful stops on the Bourbon Trail. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and operates continuously, except for the summer months, typically July through early September. Come and enjoy an experience you won\\'t forget with an overview of their processes, walking exploration of the property and, of course, bourbon tastings. Plus, enjoy a mellow moment during your visit by stopping to smell a few of the many red roses on the distillery grounds. Advance reservations are recommended for parties of 10 or more, particularly for those visiting on weekends. AIAFullscreen Humana Building - Louisville (Michael Graves, FAIA): Humana\\'s 26-story, 525,000-square-foot corporate headquarters is a National AIA Honor Award winner that directly influenced a generation of office buildings through its approach to context. In contrast to other modern structures surrounding the site, this spectacular postmodern high-rise occupies its entire site and re-establishes the street as an essential urban form. The lower outdoor loggia area has a waterfall feature that echoes the nearby Falls of the Ohio and the 25th-floor extended balcony is supported by exposed truss work - a dramatic aesthetic fitting to Graves, who was known for his artistic and sculptural projects. AIAFullscreen Kaden Tower - Louisville (William Wesley Peters and Taliesin Architects): The Kaden Tower is a building to be seen, primarily for its unique structural system, unlike any other commercial structure in Kentucky. The 15-story office building is supported by a unique, column-free system with a steel structure suspended down from its center core and has pre-cast concrete screens that cover the glass exterior walls. The detailing of the building is similar to the organic detailing of many Frank Lloyd Wright buildings, which is not surprising as William Wesley Peters was Mr. Wright\\'s son-in-law and was head of Taliesin Offices. Other notable features are several Wright-inspired stained glass windows and a glass elevator system on the building\\'s exterior, surrounded by a low dome that houses the building\\'s air conditioning systems and accented with a reflecting pool and fountain. AIAFullscreen Kentucky Artisan Center - Berea (Myers Jolly Architects): Highly visible from I-75, the 25,000-square-foot facility is broken up into a series of buildings, creating the appearance of a small campus or village. The use of stone, wood and glass are extremely well articulated and scaled, and the interior detailing and natural daylight beautifully highlight the crafts displayed within. The Kentucky Artisan Center is a great place to experience Kentucky. You can learn about and shop for Kentucky products, experience Kentucky hospitality, explore Kentucky crafts and arts through special exhibits and events, learn about Kentucky artists and artisans, enjoy Kentucky cuisine and learn about other must-see places. Kentucky Artisan CenterFullscreen Kentucky State Capitol - Frankfort (Frank Mills Andrews): Frankfort is located astride a double curve in the Kentucky River in the central portion of the state and is known for having one of the most beautiful capitol buildings in the country. Completed in 1910 in the Beaux Arts design, the building has a beautiful plan with spaces that soar from one to another, celebrating the freedom and strength of Kentucky\\'s Commonwealth. Within the capitol are many points of interest, including the magnificent Supreme Court Chambers, a historical First Lady Doll Collection, and the Lincoln statue in the rotunda, which is one of the stops along Kentucky\\'s Lincoln Heritage Trail. AIAFullscreen Central Kentucky Thoroughbred Horse Farms: Lexington and Central Kentucky are recognized as the Horse Capital of the World, with about 450 horse farms in the region (about 150 in Lexington\\\\/Fayette County alone). Many feature architecture unique to thoroughbred breeding and racing operations, with many private estates and homes (old and new), barns, stallion breeding complexes, and training centers. Calumet Farm (added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991), with its distinctive white fences and red-trimmed farm structures, provides a breathtaking view upon arrival at Lexington\\'s Bluegrass Airport. Others include Gainesway Farm (AIA award-winning design by Ted Ceraldi), Donamire (Thomas Lett, AIA), and Ashford Stud (home of Triple Crown-winner American Pharoah, complete with interactive videos in the visitors center). They\\'re all working farms, so while many can be viewed from afar via drive-by, you should never just \\\\\"drop by.\\\\\" More than a few allow visitors by appointment or through arrangements with professional tour companies.

AIAFullscreen Kentucky Vietnam Veteran\\'s Memorial - Frankfort (Helm Roberts, AIA): Positioned atop a bluff overlooking the state\\'s capital, The Kentucky Vietnam Veteran\\'s memorial is a poetic and one-of-a-kind monument paying tribute to the men and women who gave their life serving our country. The blue-gray granite plaza of the memorial contains the names of Kentucky\\'s 1,105 citizens who died. Each name is precisely located so the shadow of the sundial pointer, or gnomon, touches each veteran\\'s name on the anniversary of their death. Thus, each individual is honored with a personal tribute. Designed by Lexington architect and veteran Helm Roberts, the Memorial received an AIA Kentucky award for design excellence in 1995. It is open to visitors every day of the year. AIAFullscreen Lake Barkley State Park Lodge - Cadiz (Edward Durell Stone): The world-class Lake Barkley Lodge is the largest building in the Kentucky state park system and one of the most visually impressive buildings in the Commonwealth. Designed by famed architect Edward Durrell Stone, it embodies many qualities of modernist architecture with superb siting, careful separation of public and private spaces, efficient use of space and form, and close integration with the natural environment. Situated on a small peninsula, its three levels rise dramatically from the wooded shoreline that surrounds it. Using a post-and-beam wood construction of western cedar, Douglas fir and three-and one-half acres of glass, the recently renovated Barkley Lodge complex provides beautiful lake views and stands with exceptional presence and stylistic power. AIAFullscreen Louisville Palace Theater - Louisville (John Eberson): The Palace was the centerpiece of Louisville\\'s cinematic and dramatic history for much of the 20th century, and remains a popular cultural venue today. Designed by the famed movie house architect John Eberson, the Palace\\'s unique atmosphere stems from its Spanish Baroque motif. Elegant and ornate, the architecture features arcades, balconies and turrets. Cobalt blue and bursts of red and gold indirectly light all of the niches, coves and entrances. Above is a curved, vaulted ceiling with 139 sculptured faces of historical figures and the interior auditorium is heavily ornamented, displaying an imitation nighttime sky on the ceiling. AIAFullscreen Louisville Free Public Library, Southwest Regional Branch - Louisville (JRA Architects \\\\/ Meyer, Scherer & Rockcastle, Ltd.): Winner of a 2015 AIA Kentucky Honor Award for Excellence in Architectural Design, this ambitious project established a memorable identity for a community library. As a civic building, the west fa\\\\u00e7ade presents a strong statement that speaks of its importance to the community. The glazing of the ground-floor fa\\\\u00e7ade and the overhanging volumes signal welcome. The solids and voids in massing and the overlapping skins provide visual interest for both the exterior and the interior and creates extensions from the inside to the outside. The interior experience is generous and light-filled, with great views of the landscape and sky and a sense of place is created for reading, sitting and simply being in the connective moment between architecture and landscape. Lara Swimmer PhotographyFullscreen Louisville Water Works and Pump Station No. 1 - Louisville (Theodore Scowden and assistant Charles Hermany (original) and K. Norman Berry Associates Architects): Although numerous waterworks were built in the United States during the first half of the 19th century, this unique group of buildings is a remarkable survivor - particularly the 1st Pump Station and original priming tower. Designed in 1856, the Classical Revival-style structure includes a slate roof and terracotta and cast iron decorative elements and resembles a two-story temple. In 1971, the Pumping Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and it has since been restored and turned into a water museum. The museum showcases the history of the Louisville water company and the water purification processes, including some little-known facts and photos of the original pumps and pipes that ran under the city. AIAFullscreen National Corvette Museum - Bowling Green (Kenneth Neumann\\\\/Joel Smith & Associates): The National Corvette Museum is noted for its award-winning architectural design, with sweeping lines inspired by the car it honors. In contrast to the traditional museum, the interior of this building uses curved walls, geometric design and full-scale diorama displays to tell the story of the Corvette\\'s past, present and future. The most prominent exterior feature is a large circular car salon encased by a striking yellow conical roof with a 12-story red spire. Known as the \\\\\"Skydome,\\\\\" this section of the museum has become a landmark for the Bowling Green area, made even more famous by the sinkhole that opened beneath it in 2014, swallowing numerous cars. The space has since reopened with a viewing window offering a glimpse at the cave below and an interactive \\\\\"Corvette Cave-In\\\\\" exhibit where visitors can watch the last of the salvageable cars come back to life in the museum\\'s Restoration Area. AIAFullscreen Northern Kentucky University Student Union - Highland Heights (Omni Architects): NKU envisioned their award-winning Student Union as a \\\\\"hub\\\\\" for the entire campus, creating a crossroads for student, faculty and staff activities. As a result, circulation is a major programmatic element in this facility. A tiered three-story atrium ties each floor together, giving occupants an opportunity to engage the building\\'s many activities in a variety of ways. The glazed fa\\\\u00e7ade of the atrium runs along the entire north face of the building, parallel to the main pedestrian path, thus providing natural daylight and connecting passersby to the activity inside. In addition, a butt-glazed and zinc tower with an LED lighting system can be programmed to feature various colors associated with holidays and academic events, serving as a beacon for the life on campus. AIAFullscreen Shaker Village at Pleasant Hill - Harrodsburg (Shaker Community): Nestled in the rolling hills of central Kentucky, this picturesque collection of buildings that formerly housed the religious Shaker Community displays architectural marvels, skilled craftsmanship and a sense of profound spirituality. The finely crafted interior and exterior details of these iconic structures have been meticulously restored and the unique character of each building displays the simple principles and practices of the Shakers. For example, creative wood-framed construction techniques were used to allow clear structural spans for the unique \\\\\"Shaker\\\\\" dances and dual staircases in the buildings separated men from women. Their quest for simplicity and perfection is reflected in their fine designs and craftsmanship, and today the term Shaker-made is synonymous with excellence around the world, making the historic Shaker Village at Pleasant Hill a must see. AIAFullscreen Speed Art Museum Expansion - Louisville (Arthur Loomis (original 1927); wHY Architecture \\\\/ K. Norman Berry Associates Architects (2015 addition)): The historic, Beaux Arts building by Arthur Loomis was respectfully restored and updated with its award-winning 2015 addition, providing an excellent example of contemporary architecture and how it relates to the more traditional texture and context of the existing building and surroundings. Its simple volume is clad in a custom folded panel that gives it a softness and animating texture. The material palette and siting work well with the existing museum and the smart siting allows beautiful views from the lobby to the historic building. Rafael GamoFullscreen 21c Museum Hotels - Louisville and Lexington (Deborah Berke Partners with K. Norman Berry Associates Architects (Louisville) and with Perfido Weiskopf Wagstaff + Goettel, LLC (Lexington)): Founders Steve Wilson and Laura Lee Brown envisioned the original 21c Museum Hotel and four subsequent 21c projects to create both an economic driver for the community and an oasis where art challenges, amuses, stimulates conversation and provokes new ideas. The first of the award-winning 21c hotels, 21c Louisville is a radical re-envisioning of five contiguous 19th-century warehouse buildings in Louisville\\'s downtown historic district. The architect\\'s straightforward, modern insertions weave the original buildings together, highlighting elements of the original fabric and providing opportunities to display dramatic, large-scale contemporary art. 21c Lexington transforms the historic Fayette National Bank Building, a Beaux Arts 15-story tower designed in 1914 by renowned New York architects McKim, Mead & White and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The design references the sophistication of old clubhouses and the saturated colors of the bluegrass landscape, while continuing the 21c emphasis on showcasing contemporary art. The former banking hall has been restored as the hub of activity by revealing its original grand proportions and repurposing the space as the vibrant Lockbox restaurant, bar and lounge. AIAFullscreen Spindletop Hall - Lexington (E.T. Hutchings): Spindletop Hall has been a Kentucky showplace since its completion in 1935, at a cost of $1 million. A Georgian Revival-style mansion, originally built with oil money from the famous Texas Spindletop Oilfield, the extraordinary residence was a very modern mansion in the era it was built. It featured materials and furnishings imported from Europe and Asia and its circular staircase and 30-foot by 60-foot living room were the largest in the state at the time. In addition, the mansion housed 40 rooms - each with its own thermostat -14 bathrooms, 133 full-size exterior and interior doors, 102 windows with screens of copper, and 11 fireplaces, encompassing over 45,000 square feet of floor space. The property was sold in 1959 to the University of Kentucky, which utilizes the home and acreage as a faculty club, for research and as a teaching farm. AIAFullscreen St. Mary\\'s Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption - Covington (Leon Coquard; David Davis): A replica of the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, this example of Gothic architecture is one of the few examples left in North America. Constructed of Bedford stone, the exterior features some of the best cut stone in the country in addition to red Ludovici tile roofs, flying buttresses and huge stained glass stories of the Bible. Interior features include the high altar carved from Carrara marble with floors of Rosata and Breche marble, tile mosaic stations of the cross, plus beautiful organs and woodwork that will take your breath away. AIAFullscreen Thoroughbred Racetracks - Louisville and Lexington: Kentucky is known around the world for thoroughbred horse racing, showcased at two world-class racecourses, both of which were designated National Historic Landmarks in 1986. Churchill Downs\\' iconic Twin Spires atop the grandstands remain its most recognizable architectural feature and serve as a symbol of the racetrack. Designed by architect Joseph Dominic Baldez and built in 1895, the Spires have been preserved through several massive renovation projects that have modernized the venerable grandstand, clubhouse and grounds to accommodate more than 165,000 guests on Kentucky Derby Day. Eighty miles east of Louisville is Lexington\\'s Keeneland Racecourse. Lexington architect Robert McMeekin won a 1935 design competition to transform Jack Keene\\'s training center\\\\/country estate, giving the existing stone barn new life as a clubhouse. The track\\'s growth has largely remained seamless through several phases of expansion, with each drawing heavily on Keene and McMeekin\\'s repertoire of limestone, stout round arches and meticulous attention to detail. By 1976, the original timber grandstand was succeeded by a concrete and steel replacement designed by the leading racecourse architects of the day, Arthur Froehlich and Associates. In 1984, another addition to the rear was built, featuring balconies giving elevated views across the paddock. The exterior of the extension was clad in limestone, with round arches on its ground floor in homage to Keeneland\\'s architectural heritage. AIAFullscreen Wild Turkey Bourbon Visitor Center - Lawrenceburg (De Leon & Primmer Architecture Workshop): Located on a bluff overlooking the Kentucky River, the Visitor Center is the newest component of recent additions and expansions to the Wild Turkey Bourbon Distillery Complex, one of seven original member distilleries of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. The 9,140-square-foot facility houses interactive exhibits, a gift shop, event venues, a tasting room and administrative offices. In concert with a major re-branding program that caters to both longtime devoted fans and a growing legion of new bourbon enthusiasts, the project employs a design direction that is both familiar and new - bridging tradition and innovation through an immersive environment of contrasts and dualities. The Visitors Center has been recognized by AIA with both state and national awards for excellence in architectural design. De Leon & Primmer Architecture WorkshopFullscreen Yew Dell Botanical Gardens - Crestwood (De Leon & Primmer Architecture Workshop): Yew Dell is an internationally recognized center of gardening, plants and education, all offered in a stunning site of significant historical importance. Originally the home, gardens and commercial nursery of the late Theodore Klein and his family, Yew Dell now offers the public exceptional display gardens, an ambitious slate of education programs and community events, ongoing garden plant research and hiking trails.

Designed by Eero Saarinen and completed in 1962, the terminal is both compact in size and spacious in feel. Today the building serves approximately 22 million travelers a year. AIAFullscreen Monticello, Charlottesville (Architect: Thomas Jefferson): Monticello was designed and built by founding father Thomas Jefferson from 1770-1784, and then remodeled and enlarged from 1796-1809. The pinnacle of Jefferson\\'s Classical Revival style, the home is constructed of red brick with white accents, much like the Academical Village at UVA. There are many uniquely Jeffersonian touches throughout, such as disappearing beds, dumbwaiters, and a clock run by weights and pulleys. Jack LooneyFullscreen Maymont, Richmond (Architect: Edgerton S. Rogers): A fine Romanesque home overlooking the James River, Maymont is a symbol of the overflowing luxury of America\\'s Gilded Age. Designed by Edgerton S. Rodgers for the prominent Dooley family of Richmond, the house features multiple corner towers and delicate stained-glass windows. Surrounded by gardens of every variety, Maymont is a favorite Richmond destination. Maymont FoundationFullscreen Jamestown Fort, Jamestown (Architect: Virginia Company): Hastily built almost immediately after the first settlers arrived, the Jamestown Fort was the first permanent structure Virginia. The fort was most likely constructed of wood from the trees of the surrounding land. Triangular in shape with rounded watchtowers at each corner, the fort would be rebuilt twice to provide more adequate protection for the settlement. AIAFullscreen Mount Vernon, Alexandria (Architect: Augustine Washington): Originally a one-and-a-half-story farmhouse built by his father in 1735, George Washington\\'s Mount Vernon was enlarged from 1754-1799, with Washington personally overseeing plans and construction, even while at war. The mansion\\'s most iconic exterior feature, the two-story piazza, was designed by Washington and became a popular feature on many colonial homes. Lincoln BluesFullscreen Pope-Leighey House, Alexandria (Architect: Frank Lloyd Wright): Designed by the famed Frank Lloyd Wright for journalist Loren Pope, the Pope-Leighey House is an example of the architect\\'s commitment to innovative, modestly sized and affordable homes during the 1930s and 40s. Once in the path of Highway 66 construction, the house was moved to Woodlawn in Alexandria after being given to the National Trust by Mrs. Leighey. HABSFullscreen Christ Church, Alexandria (Architect: Col. James Wren): Designed by James Wren and built from 1767-1773, Christ Church is a humble structure with immense history. George Washington attended service here, and many presidents have visited throughout the years. Originally a simple two-story rectangular building, the tower was added in 1818. The Church is one of the least-altered examples of this type of small colonial church still surviving today. AIAFullscreen Main Street Station, Richmond (Architect: Wilson, Harris and Richards Architects): Built by the Wilson, Harris, and Richards firm in 1901, Main Street Station opened at the peak of rail travel. The French Renaissance-style building was considered a jewel of the city with its signature clock tower at the time of its completion, and is still one of the Richmond\\'s most recognizable landmarks. Reopened in 2003, the station now serves train and automobile passengers alike. AIAFullscreen Taubman Museum of Art, Roanoke (Architect: Randall Stout Architects): A striking addition to Roanoke\\'s downtown district, the Randall Stout-designed Taubman Museum of Art is unlike any structure in the city. Inspired by the mountain ridges, gorges and clear streams of the Blue Ridge, the building\\'s silhouette rises and falls in ridges of glass, steel and zinc. This new addition to the museum offers 81,000 square feet of gallery, education and public space. AIAFullscreen Governor\\'s Palace, Williamsburg (Architect: Henry Cary): A faithful reproduction of the original building completed in 1722, the Governor\\'s Palace stands today as a connection to Virginia\\'s British past. Seven royal governors lived in the Georgian home, as well as the first two elected governors of Virginia. Designed to convey power and authority, the elegant home soon became the model to which wealthy landowners aspired. AIAFullscreen Lynchburg Courthouse and Monument Terrace, Lynchburg (Architect: Andrew Ellison, Jr. (Courthouse) and Hurd and Chesterman (Staircase)): Home to the Lynchburg Museum, Lynchburg Courthouse was designed by William Ellison and completed in 1855. The courthouse was constructed in the popular Greek Revival style, complete with Doric columns and a portico topped with a pediment. Leading up to the entrance of the courthouse is Monument Terrace, a stair erected as a monument to fallen soldiers from WWI to Vietnam. AIAFullscreen Shirley Plantation, Charles City (Architect: John Carter): Virginia\\'s oldest plantation, Shirley Plantation was founded in 1613. The present \\\\\"great house\\\\\" was completed in 1738 in an Anglo-Dutch style, featuring a stout cube layout, dormer windows and two-story pedimented porticoes. The plantation is still run by direct descends of the founding farmer Edward Hill. AIAFullscreen Dovetail Construction Company, Inc., Richmond (Architect: Walter Parks Architect): This 2010 office building was originally an electric railway car barn constructed in 1907. Walter Parks Architects\\' striking design relies on new construction, adaptive reuse and historical preservation. The building is the first in the U.S. to be LEED Platinum Certified, on the National Register of Historic Places, and Net Zero Energy. AIAFullscreen Capitol of Williamsburg (Architect: Henry Cary): Rebuilt after Henry Cary\\'s original capitol building burned, the H-shaped structure that stands in Williamsburg today is actually the third building to stand on the site. With its six-sided cupola and arched windows, the present building is \\\\\"substantially similar\\\\\" to Cary\\'s original design. It was here that men argued for independence in 1776, making Virginia one of the first states to do so. HABSFullscreen Fort Monroe National Monument, Hampton (Architect: Brigadier General Simon Bernard): Built between 1836 and 1840, Fort Monroe was designed by Brigadier General Simon Bernard as a component of the Third System of coastal defense. Sitting on Old Pointe Comfort in the Chesapeake Bay, the irregular work fortification is characterized by its immense size, stone construction and surrounding moat. A Union stronghold during the Civil War, the fort was a refuge for freedom-seeking slaves. HABSFullscreen Gunston Hall, Lorton (Architect: William Buckland and William Bernard Sears): The home of Virginia Declaration of Rights author George Mason, Gunston Hall sits on the banks of the Potomac River south of Alexandria. Built between 1755 and 1758, the house is relatively small and modest, but boasts an impressively ornate interior including a Palladian drawing room and Chinese Chippendale room. AIAFullscreen The Jefferson Hotel, Richmond (Architect: Carrere and Hastings): A symbol of luxury and style, Richmond\\'s Jefferson Hotel was built in 1895. Financed by Lewis Ginter, the hotel was designed by Carrere and Hastings, incorporating multiple architectural styles into one magnificent building. The exterior relies mostly on Italian and Spanish Renaissance elements, while much of the interior was destroyed by fire in 1902. Peebles is responsible for the famed Grand Staircase in the east addition, built after the fire. AIAFullscreen The Academical Village and The Rotunda at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville (Architect: Thomas Jefferson): Designed by Thomas Jefferson and completed in 1825, the Academical Village serves as the heart of the University of Virginia. The terraced lawn is surrounded by academic and residential buildings, including the University\\'s most recognizable building, the Rotunda. The Village also houses the preserved dorm room of Edgar Allen Poe, one of the University\\'s most infamous students. Jefferson\\'s design has been used as an inspiration for many other green spaces on campuses across the country. The heart of the Academical Village and the University of Virginia\\'s campus, the Rotunda stands as one of Thomas Jefferson\\'s most recognizable architectural accomplishments. Modeled after the Pantheon in Rome, the Rotunda was constructed from 1822-1826. Ravaged by fire in 1895 and rebuilt with alterations, the Rotunda now stands as Jefferson designed it after being restored from 1973-1976. AIAFullscreen Poplar Forest, Forest (Architect: Thomas Jefferson): Relatively unknown until recently, Poplar Forest was Thomas Jefferson\\'s personal retreat in Forest, Va. Distinctly Jeffersonian, with an octagonal design, skylight and classical Palladian elements, the home is thought to be his most mature and personal project. Altered throughout its varied ownership after Jefferson, the home is currently being restored. John HenleyFullscreen Smithfield Plantation, Blacksburg (Architect: Col. William Preston): Built in 1773 on what was then the edge of Virginia\\'s frontier, Smithfield Plantation is located in the present town of Blacksburg. Although built in the westernmost region, the home\\'s architectural style is much like that of many plantations in Tidewater. The simple two-story L-shaped house covered in clapboard siding is now open as a museum. AIAFullscreen Virginia State Capitol (Architect: Thomas Jefferson): The first public building in America to be constructed in the Monumental Classical style, the Virginia State Capitol was designed by Thomas Jefferson and completed in 1792. The temple-esque building has served as the seat of both the state government of Virginia and the larger government of the Confederacy. Two classical wings now flank the original central building. HABSFullscreen Stratford Hall, Stratford (Architect: Col. Thomas Lee): Birthplace of Robert E. Lee, this H-shaped early Georgian house was home to many notable historical figures, including two signers of the Declaration of Independence and several Virginia governors. Stratford Hall\\'s most unique features are the twin sets of four chimneys, connected by arches, which form semi-enclosed deck space on the roof. AIAFullscreen Sweet Briar House, Sweet Briar (Architect: Joseph Crews): Originally a two-story Federal-style house known as Locust Ridge, the villa that serves as the home to Sweet Briar College presidents today came to be after additions were added to the original home from 1851-1852. The Fletcher family was inspired by the Italianate architecture they had seen on a Grand Tour of Europe and added two towers on either side of the structure. AIAFullscreen War Memorial Chapel and Pylons, Burruss Hall, and Moss Center for the Arts at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg (Architects: Roy F. Larson, FAIA, of Harbeson, Hough, Livingston & Larson and William Carneal, J. Ambler Johnston, AIA, of Carneal, Johnston & Wright, Architects and Engineers, and Sn\\\\u00f8hetta): Standing above the War Memorial, the Pylons at Virginia Tech memorialize every student and alumni who died in service from WWI to the present. Each pylon symbolizes one of Virginia Tech\\'s core values. They stand for Brotherhood, Honor, Leadership, Sacrifice, Service, Loyalty, Duty and Ut Prosim. Virginia Tech\\'s most recognizable building, the original confines of Burruss Hall were completed in 1936. Overlooking the university\\'s drill field, the building houses the College of Architecture and Urban Studies. Burruss Hall is constructed of Hokie Stone, a limestone native to the Blacksburg area named after the school\\'s mascot. Named for Virginia artist P. Buckley Moss, The Moss Center for the Arts is a structure where technology and art exist in harmony. Designed by Norwegian firm Sn\\\\u00f8hetta, the center houses classrooms, gallery space, a beautiful 1,280-seat theater and a \\\\\"performance laboratory\\\\\" named the Cube. Opened in 2013, the Moss Center for the Arts is a visually stunning addition to the Virginia Tech campus. AIAFullscreen The Sir Christopher Wren Building, Williamsburg (Architect: Sir Christopher Wren): William and Mary University\\'s most recognizable structure, the Wren Building is the oldest academic building still in use in the United States. Although it has been suffered major damage three times by fire, today\\'s dormered brick building was restored to its 1732 condition by John D. Rockefeller. HABSFullscreenLike this topic?

The 630-foot-tall stainless steel, inverted, flattened catenary arch is as modern today as when it was conceived 68 years ago - \\\\\"a landmark of lasting significance.\\\\\" Construction is nearly complete to expand the Museum of Westward Expansion toward the Old Courthouse with a new west entrance and a park over the highway to unite the Arch grounds with downtown St. Louis. John C. Guenther, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen Kansas City Union Station (Architect: Jarvis Hunt, Architect, Chicago, Illinois; Renovation\\\\/Science City\\\\/Skywalk to Crown Center architects: HNTB, Production Architect and Architect of Record; Union Station Architects (USA) - a team of prominent architects including HNTB; BNIM; CDFM2; Rafael Architects; Mackey Mitchell Architects and Zahner; Todd Bolender Center for Dance and Creativity: BNIM Architects): Once the third largest train station in the country, the monumentally proportioned, Beaux-Arts Classic style train station, with its T-shaped plan extending over the train tracks, opened in 1914 with 850,000 square feet, 900 rooms and monumental interior volumes. While hundreds of thousands of passengers passed through the station each year in its prime, its use began to decline after World War II and was closed in the 1980s, narrowly escaping demolition until a sales tax initiative was passed to save it. Today it houses Science City, the Arvin Gottlieb Planetarium, the Regnier Extreme Screen Theatre (3-D movie screen), the H&R Bloch City Stage Theater, temporary museum exhibits, restaurants, shops and an Amtrak Station and the Todd Bolender Center for Dance and Creativity. Getty Images\\\\/iStockphotoFullscreen The Bloch Building\\\\/The Nelson-Atkins Art Museum of Art (Design Architect: Steven Holl, FAIA, of Steven Holl Architect; Architect of Record: BNIM): The Steven Holl, FAIA design strikes a delicate and respectful balance between old and new when Holl describes his concept as \\\\\"the stone and the feather,\\\\\" in which the 1933 Nelson Atkins Art Museum (designed by Wight & Wight), with its original, formal, classical Beaux-Arts stone museum is complemented by the new 2007 Bloch Building addition (the feather) with ample natural light through channel glass walls, free circulation, and flowing space -- all set to the east of the original. The Bloch Building, an 870-foot-long extension, integrates architecture and landscape, featuring sculptural glass \\\\\"lenses\\\\\" that project through grass-covered roofs and a dramatic lobby and galleries with curved walls of natural light during the day that glow at night. The new addition joins the original at the east base of the Nelson-Atkins Museum, integrating with and improving the original museum\\'s circulation patterns. Timothy HursleyFullscreen The Abbey of Saint Mary and Saint Louis -- Priory Chapel, Church for the parish of Saint Anselm at the St. Louis Abbey (Architect: Gyo Obata, FAIA of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum (HOK)): Originally designed for a community of Benedictine monks, this remarkable 1962 monastic church transcends time, is transformational, and achieves a balance and synergy between monasticism and modernity. Architect Gyo Obata, FAIA conceived the building before Vatican II, and the plan and structure have a clarity and simplicity that impart a unified, uncluttered, and serene place for worship which has remained mostly unchanged for its fifty-four years of service. The elegance of structure, simplicity of materials, soft quality of natural light, acoustics for singing and chanting, and central focus on the altar all contribute to the theological heart of worship, whether in community or in quiet contemplation. John C. Guenther, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen Bolduc House: The Louis Bolduc House is an important French Colonial building and a prime example of poteaux sur solle (posts-on-sill) construction that uses vertical oak timbers set about six inches apart and infilled with bousillage (a mixture of mud, straw, and horsehair) that hardened to a cement-like texture. A porch wraps around the house and provides shade and protection to the living quarters, with windows allow for cooling cross ventilation. This meticulously restored home is now a museum and a National Historic Landmark that is now owned by the National Society of Colonial Dames of America in the State of Missouri. Susan HurtFullscreen Daniel Boone Regional Library (Architect: Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, New York and Los Angeles): Built in 2002, the 102,000-square-foot Columbia Public Library is a noteworthy design by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates. Its dynamic, dramatic cylindrical form is a prime example of the architecture firm\\'s approach: collages of styles, colliding forms, and superimposing one plan idea onto another to yield geometric and dramatic interior spaces. Large skylights are \\\\\"carved\\\\\" from the curved, masonry cylinder to introduce abundant natural light while shifted grids, diagonals, and a range of materials, colors, and textures result in a more informal and humanistic architecture. Tom Kessler, Daniel Boone Regional LibraryFullscreen The Boley Building (Architect: Louis Curtiss; Renovation and restoration architect: Helix Architecture + Design): The first glass and metal curtain wall building in the United States, the six-story Boley Building was designed by Canadian-born architect Louis Curtiss as a clothing store for Charles N. Boley, offering abundant glass for the display of merchandise. The Boley Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. After an extensive, multi-phase renovation and restoration project designed by Helix Architecture + Design was completed in 2009, the Boley Building is now the corporate headquarters of Andrews McMeel Universal, an international media and entertainment company. Michael Robinson PhotographyFullscreen Firestone Baars Chapel at Stephens College (Architect: Eero Saarinen, FAIA, Eero Saarinen & Associates): In 1939, the students and faculty at Stephens College selected Eliel Saarinen in 1939 to create a chapel to represent many faiths and their commonality. With the passing of Eliel Saarinen in 1950, his son, Eero Saarinen, FAIA, then designed the 300-seat, elegant chapel within a simple, geometric cube topped by a pyramidal roof and spire, a redesign and reinterpretation of the earlier concept for a round building with a dome (metaphor for eternity) with a surrounding reflecting pool (place of solitude and spirituality) as proposed by his father. Its four vestibule entries reach out in all directions; the sanctuary is separated from the exterior by a perforated brick screen wall, and terraced seats surround the altar under a central skylight and corner skylights with an elegant structural wood frame roof. John C. Guenther, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen St. Mary Aldermanbury: The St. Mary Aldermanbury is a reconstructed building designed by one of the greatest Baroque architects, Sir Christopher Wren, after the Great Fire of London in 1666 destroyed the original church. Today\\'s structure is made up of three elements: the reconstructed Church of St. Mary Aldermanbury, the museum located below the Church, and the \\\\\"Breakthrough\\\\\" sculpture with eight sections of the Berlin Wall to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall and the \\\\\"Sinews of Peace\\\\\" speech that Churchill gave in Fulton in 1946. With only a blackened shell and tower remaining after World War II bombings, it was slated for demolition twenty years later, at which time, Westminster College stepped in to offer to save and reconstruct the church in honor of Churchill. After four years of planning and raising financial support, the stone blocks were labeled and shipped to Fulton, followed by a reconstruction groundbreaking ceremony (April, 1964) with President Harry Truman in attendance, the rebuilding of church and a May 1969 dedication, more than three hundred years after the Great Fire of London destroyed it. John C. Guenther, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen National World War I Museum at Liberty Memorial (Architect: Harold Van Buren Magonigle, New York; Architect: Wight and Wight; Restoration and expansion architect: ASAI Architecture): Liberty Memorial is a monumentally-scaled Beaux Arts Classical design composed of a pair of limestone buildings, Memory Hall and Exhibition Hall; a 217-foot-tall towering shaft, Liberty Memorial Tower; sculptures of four Guardian Spirits, two Assyrian Sphinxes, two Cinerary urns; the Great Frieze bas-relief; decorative bronze art; and dramatic open vistas. An impressive team of architects led by Harold Van Buren Magonigle, landscape architects, artists, and civic leaders created this compelling monument to those who sacrificed their lives during World War I and those who survived, with the orientation of the architecture and the site rotated eleven degrees off of true north in reference to the signing of the World War I Armistice at 11 AM on November 11, 1918. The restoration and expansion of the Liberty Memorial into a state-of-the art underground museum and research center presents a comprehensive interpretation of World War was designed by ASAI Architecture, with its competition-winning design to reconstruct the memorial and its deteriorated concrete frame and build the new National World War I Museum beneath. John C. Guenther, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen The Frank Lloyd Wright House in Ebsworth Park, Kraus House (Architect: Frank Lloyd Wright): Frank Lloyd Wright designed this 1,900-square-foot Usonian house of brick, cypress wood, and glass for artist Russell Kraus and his wife, Ruth Goetz Kraus. It is the first in St. Louis and one of only five buildings in the state designed by Wright. Beautifully situated on ten-and-a-half acres of wooded hillside, this home\\'s interior spaces retain all of the original Wright-designed furnishings and fabrics and extend outward under protective overhangs and elevated terraces.

Guenther, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen New York Life Building (Architect: McKim, Mead, & White; Renovation and restoration architect: Gastinger, Walker & Harden): Standing 180 feet tall and featuring the city\\'s first elevators, the New York Life Building was built in 1890 and is considered the first skyscraper in Kansas City. Architecture firm McKim, Mead, & White\\'s design for the New York Life Building employs the Italianate Renaissance Revival style and has beautiful, soaring proportions resulting from its H-shaped footprint that also frames a monumental, two-ton, cast bronze bald eagle sculpted by Louis St. Gaudens and perched above the main entry. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and abandoned by 1988, it underwent a $35-million restoration that updated energy, communications, and environmental systems and included a ten-story, north in-fill addition to improve circulation, functionality, and safety. Mike Sinclair PhotographyFullscreen The Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts (Architect: Moshe Safdie, FAIA, Safdie Architects; Associate Architect: BNIM): The Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts sits on a dramatic, 18.5-acre downtown hilltop site and is composed of the 1,600-seat Helzberg Hall and the 1,800-seat Muriel Kauffman Theatre that provide dedicated halls for symphony, ballet, opera and theater. Each hall is housed within dramatic, distinctive half-shell, stone and metal-clad forms that evoke a musical instrument and are shaped by acoustic, sight line and performance requirements. Both halls share backstage spaces and a single, dramatic, multi-story lobby with glass roof and sloping glass walls which offer expansive views of the historic warehouse district and entertainment district to the south. Timothy HursleyFullscreen Power & Light Apartments (Architect: Hoit, Price & Barnes; Renovation architect: NSPJ Architects): At 30 stories and 479 feet in height, this prominent limestone-clad Art Deco high-rise, distinctive step-back, telescoping profile contributes to the Kansas City skyline, crowned with a dramatic six story illuminated lantern and multi-sided glass cupola. It remained Missouri\\'s tallest habitable structure for over 40 years and is one of the finest examples of American Art Deco architecture.

After losing its major tenants, it has recently undergone an impressive renovation and conversion to a residential tower with 210 luxury apartments - the Power & Light Apartments. Jacia Phillips PhotographyFullscreen St. Louis Union Station (Architect: Theodore Link, original building; Engineer: George H. Pegram, train shed; Renovation, hotel, shopping mall, restaurants, and food court: Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum (HOK) Architects; Renovation architect: The Lawrence Group): When completed in 1894, Theodore Link\\'s design for St. Louis Union Station was one of the largest and greatest train stations of its time and considered an architectural jewel, serving more than 100,000 passengers a day in its peak usage through its 32 boarding gates. The Richardsonian Romanesque Headhouse features the Grand Hall, with its sixty-five-foot high barrel vault with sweeping arches, gold leaf, frescoes, and stained glass, while the Train Shed, designed by George H. Pegram, was the largest train shed ever built, covering thirty-two tracks and over twelve acres with his patented truss structure. The Train Shed and Headhouse received National Historic Landmark designation in 1970, and after a long period of vacancy, it was reopened in 1985 with a $150-million renovation designed by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum Architects which included a 539-room hotel, shopping mall, restaurants, and food court. Recently, ownership has changed and further modifications have been made to the property. John C. Guenther, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen The Pulitzer Arts Foundation (Designer: Tadao Ando; Architect of Record: Christner Inc.): The Pulitzer Arts Foundation opened in 2001 after being founded by curator and philanthropist Emily Rauh Pulitzer, who commissioned this masterwork by the Pritzker Prize-winning designer Tadao Ando of Osaka, Japan - his first freestanding public work in the United States. Tadao\\'s design approach favors simplicity, circuitous circulation routes, and controlled views. The Pulitzer Arts Foundation features pristine geometric forms and uncompromising boxes of beautifully finished poured-in-place concrete, a central court and reflecting pool - all infused with ritual and a sense of mystery, enhanced expectations, order, and serenity that result in a sanctuary for experiencing art, changing exhibitions, artistic collaborations, and innovative programs. John C. Guenther, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen Central Bank, formerly Empire Bank (Architect: Bruce J. Graham, FAIA, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill LLP, Architects): The Empire Bank is a classic modern design by Bruce J. Graham, FAIA of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill LLP, who also led the design of Chicago\\'s first two hundred-story towers: the John Hancock Center in 1970 and the Sears Tower (now the Willis Tower) in 1974. Built in 1964, the structural frame of exposed steel surrounds large expanses of glass -- a very simple, elegant design -- and pays homage to the design influence of Mies van der Rohe. This strong organizing idea makes efficient use of the available site, tucking the drive-through bank functions neatly under the upper level office functions, all within a dignified, beautifully proportioned building. Gretchen Miekley, Central BankFullscreen Compton Hill Water Tower (Architect: Harvey Ellis, Designer for George R. Mann, Architect): Built as a stand pipe to absorb surges from reciprocating water pumps and ensure consistent water pressure, the 179-foot-tall Compton Hill Water Tower was designed in 1893 by Harvey Ellis for George R. Mann and completed by 1898. The Compton Water Tower illustrates Ellis\\' design philosophy - \\\\\"not symmetry but balance\\\\\" - and is the last Midwestern design by Harvey Ellis, considered to be the link between H. H. Richardson and the masters of the Prairie School, before he returned home to Rochester, New York, in 1893. This beautiful tower, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, serves as a focal point for the Shaw and Compton Heights neighborhoods and is one of three remaining water towers in St. Louis and is often open to the public. John C. Guenther, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen First Community Church (Architect: R.L. Fischer & Associates, St. Louis): R.L. Fischer & Associates designed this modern church in 1960 with a plan which grows out of the building site and budget, resulting in a simple, direct, and elegant design. The architects wrote that the combination of a narrow triangular site, surrounded entirely by streets, yielded a large forecourt entry to the sanctuary and a dignified approach for the worshipper, while the budget limitations led to construction of a simple and straightforward design for the building which excludes distractions from the outside, making the entire building a quiet sanctuary. The First Community Church was severely damaged by the Joplin EF-5 tornado of 2011 and was renovated with some changes in 2012. Andrew Wells, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen Basilica of St. Louis, King of France - Old Cathedral (Architect: Morton & Laveille; 1961 restoration architect: Murphy & Mackey; 2011-2014 restoration architect: Mackey Mitchell Architects): The first building of national significance built in the state, the Old Cathedral was completed in 1834; following a one-room log church built in 1764, a second larger log church built in 1776, and a third brick church designed by Gabriel Paul at the request of Reverend Bishop DuBourg. Situated on Cathedral Block, designated in 1764 by Auguste Chouteau, co-founder of St. Louis, the Old Cathedral on the riverfront was a focal point of the City of St. Louis for religion, civic activity, and education. The Old Cathedral is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is an excellent example of Greek Revival architecture with its stone fa\\\\u00e7ade composed of four Doric style columns of Joliet stone from Joliet, IL, with a twenty-foot square tower above the pediment which rises forty feet high with an octagonal steeple rising another forty-five feet high. John C. Guenther, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen St. Francis Xavier Church (Architects: Francis Barry Byrne and Joseph Shaughnessy; Artist & Sculpture: Alfonso Iannelli; Artist: Annette Cremin Byrne): Francis Barry Byrne and Joseph Shaughnessy were chosen to create the new church building in 1947, while artist and sculptor, Alfonso Iannelli was given free reign over the interiors and created the monumental sculpture of St. Francis Xavier at the front of the church, hewn from large blocks of stone, carved and textured to form the features of the saint, his robe and his attributes. The design of the church is unusual: the plan is shaped like a fish - a liturgical symbol of Christ - with the interior resulting in an elliptical form, 190-feet wide, with a central linear cove light in the ceiling; blue stained glass windows by Emil Frei Studio; statuary and the Stations of the Cross by Alfonso Iannelli and the primary color scheme by Annette Cremin Byrne. John C. Guenther, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen St. Louis Public Library - Central Branch (Architect: Cass Gilbert; Renovation architect: CannonDesign St. Louis, Architects): The Central Branch of the St. Louis Public Library is the crown jewel of the St. Louis Public Library system and it was made possible through a donation from Andrew Carnegie. The library was designed by Architect Cass Gilbert (designer of the Minnesota State Capitol, the Woolworth Building in New York City, and the United States Supreme Court Building) and completed in 1907. The original three-story building was designed in a Beaux-Arts style, referencing the Italian Renaissance palazzo and featured a ceremonial granite stair, a vaulted reception foyer, and a centrally located Great Hall, all surrounded by five wings -- four dedicated to public reading rooms and the fifth, the north wing, to a multistory depository of books closed to the public. In 2012, a $70-million restoration designed by CannonDesign St. Louis increased public space, modernized the library, restored the interiors and created a dramatic new north entry atrium lobby in the former book stack area. Timothy HursleyFullscreen Temple Hall at Missouri State University (Architect: Kivett & Myers, Kansas City): Named in honor of longtime science department head Allen Temple, the hall was built in 1971 and accommodates classrooms, laboratories, and undergraduate and graduate research. This cast-in-place concrete science building on the Missouri State campus is a great example of and reference to the architecture of Louis Kahn. The architecture firm, Kivett & Myers, also designed Kauffman Stadium, Arrowhead Stadium, and the Kansas City International Airport, among other projects. John C. Guenther, FAIA, LEED APFullscreen Thespian Hall (Architect: J. L. Howard): Thespian Hall is an unusual surviving Greek Revival theater, a notable mid-nineteenth century civic, theatrical, and cultural center that opened on July 4, 1857. Functions over the years have included a basement reading room, a main level theater, an upper level city hall, a barracks for troops, a hospital, and horse stable during the Civil War, theatrical plays, and a movie theater in 1912. Over the years, it has been home to everything from political events to a German singing society, and is now the home of the annual Missouri River Festival of the Arts. Martin SchwartzFullscreen Wainwright Building, also known as the Wainwright State Office Building (Architect: Louis Sullivan of Adler & Sullivan Architects, Chicago & Charles K. Ramsey, Architect, St. Louis; Renovation: Mitchell Giurgola, Architects LLP, Philadelphia and Hastings & Chivetta, St. Louis): Louis Sullivan\\'s design for the 1891 Wainwright Building, as headquarters of the St. Louis Brewing Association, and commissioned by St. Louis brewer Ellis Wainwright is considered to be the first expression of the new high-rise building type, influencing the visual compositions of future generations of tall buildings. The ten-story building gained new life in 1981 when then Missouri Gov. Kit Bond called for its renovation and expansion into a new state office complex with an addition that respects and sets off the Wainwright Building. The Wainwright Building was featured in the PBS documentary Ten Buildings that Changed America, which presented ten trend-setting works of architecture that have shaped and inspired the American landscape, and which Frank Lloyd Wright described as \\\\\"the very first human expression of a tall, steel office building as architecture.\\\\\" dFullscreenLike this topic?

Ingalls, Yale class of 1920, and David S. Ingalls, Jr., Yale class of 1956, both of whom were hockey captains. The building has since been renovated by Roche-Dinkeloo Architects. AIAFullscreen Old State House (Charles Bulfinch, Architect (attribution)): Built over three years beginning in 1793, the Connecticut Old State House in Hartford reflects the state\\'s prosperous turn in the closing decades of the 18th century. The design is attributed to Boston architect Charles Bulfinch, although this is based on interpretation of a few historical documents, not specific drawings. Notably, all of the materials used for the construction of the Old State House are from the United States, including the brownstone base which was quarried in Portland, Conn., just miles from Old State House. The building was listed as a national historic landmark in 1961. AIAFullscreen Glass House (Philip Johnson, Architect): The Glass House, with its innovative use of materials and seamless integration into the landscape, is best understood as a pavilion for viewing the surrounding landscape. Invisible from the road, the house sits on a promontory overlooking a pond and woods beyond in a 50-acre landscaped site in New Canaan. The house, designed by Philip Johnson as his own personal weekend retreat, ushered the International Style into residential American architecture. Johnson lived in the Glass House, now a historic museum, from 1949 until his death in 2005. AIAFullscreen Covered Bridge at West Cornwall (Ithiel Town, Architect): This wooden one-lane lattice truss bridge crosses the Housatonic River as a link in the Sharon-Goshen Turnpike. At least two previous bridges in the same location were destroyed by floods. The current two-span structure dates from 1864 and uses a pier from an 1841 iteration. The latticed Town Truss of closely spaced red spruce members is named for its inventor, architect Ithiel Town, a proteg\\\\u00e9 of Asher Benjamin, designer of Hartford\\'s Wadsworth Atheneum. A later queen-post truss and concealed steel deck were added for stiffening. The peaked gable roof and red paint on the siding were added in the mid-20th century. The unusual geometry of the trusses is experienced at close quarters when the bridge is crossed. AIAFullscreen Grace Farms (Sanaa Architects, Tokyo, and Handel Architects, New York): An 80-acre preserve on the grounds of a former equestrian center in New Canaan, Grace Farms is dedicated to the principles of faith, nature, art, community and justice. The 2015 River Building, situated in a landscape of fields, woods, ponds and wetlands connected by trails, contains a 700-seat amphitheater, library, cafe and a sunken basketball court. The design for the winding structure features a wafer-thin roof supported on slender columns and refers to an earlier work by the firm, the temporary Serpentine Gallery series at London\\'s Kensington Garden. Two other buildings from the former farm house a visitor\\'s center and offices. AIAFullscreen Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch (George Keller, Architect): The Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch, a Gothic monument made of brownstone from Portland, Conn., was designed by Hartford architect George Keller. The arch was dedicated on Sept. 17, 1886, the anniversary of the Battle of Antietam, to honor the 4,000 Hartford citizens who served in the Civil War and the 400 who died for the Union. The terra cotta frieze depicts scenes from the Civil War, and the tall statues represent the various kinds of residents who fought in the War. The original terra cotta angels crowning each tower were replicated in bronze and replaced in 1987. A bronze plaque honors the 128 African American Hartford residents who fought for the Union. AIAFullscreen Sturges Cottage (Joseph C. Wells, Architect): The first known American commission of the British-born Joseph C. Wells, Sturges Cottage is one of the oldest-known and best-documented examples of architect-designed Gothic Revival architecture in the United States. A rambling wood-frame structure with board and batten siding and steeply pitched gables, Sturges House was built in four stages between 1840 and 1895. AIAFullscreen Unitarian Church (Victor Lundy, Architect): The stunning shape of the Unitarian Church of Westport represents praying hands. Its parabolic curves sweep up to a skylight that runs the entire length of the ridgeline. The church was designed by Modernist architect Victor Lundy and completed in 1965. The church\\'s nickname, New Ship Church, refers to the 1681 Old Ship Church in Hingham, Mass. AIAFullscreen Avon Old Farms School (Theodate Pope Riddle, Architect): Avon Old Farms School was founded by Theodate Pope Riddle, Connecticut\\'s first licensed female architect. Influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and the ideals of the old New England farm, Riddle designed and supervised the building of the school between 1918 and 1927. The original stone and oak architecture is modeled after English Cotswold and Tudor styles using traditional English methods with many of the materials hewn from the school\\'s property. AIAFullscreen Connecticut State Capitol (Richard M. Upjohn, Architect): Designed by cathedral architect Richard M. Upjohn, this High Victorian Gothic-style statehouse was opened in 1878 and designated a Registered National Historic Landmark in 1971. The beautiful and unique building is set in picturesque Bushnell Park and houses the executive offices and legislative chambers of the state, as well as historical memorabilia including statues of Nathan Hale and Governor William Buckingham. Its exterior marble and granite are accented by the gold leaf dome. The stenciling, stained-glass windows and light fixtures were designed by Boston interior decorator William James McPherson. AIAFullscreen The First Church of Christ, Simsbury (Isaac Damon, Master Builder): Founded in 1697, the Simsbury Congregational Church has more than a 300-year history. The first meeting house in Simsbury was built in 1683. After occupying several sites, the current church was erected in 1830 in the Federal style, with influences from Christopher Wren\\'s design for St. Paul\\'s Cathedral in London. The original interior rear wall stands to either side of the present chancel. The church has undergone various restorations and several additions over the years. AIAFullscreen Mark Twain House (Edward Tuckerman Potter, Architect): Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens) and his wife Olivia \\\\\"Livy\\\\\" Clemens, were married in 1870 and moved to Hartford in 1871, purchasing land on Farmington Avenue and engaging Edward Tuckerman Potter to design a new house. Livy assumed the lead role in design decisions. Mark Twain described the house: \\\\\"To us, our house has a heart, and a soul, and eyes to see us with; and approvals and solicitudes and deep sympathies; it was of us, and we were in its confidence and lived in its grace and the peace of its benediction.\\\\\" In September 1874, the family moved in, but money problems forced the Clemenses to move to Europe in 1891, and the property was sold in 1903. AIAFullscreen Yale Art Gallery (Egerton Swartwout, Architect; Louis I. Kahn, Architect): This is the oldest art gallery in the Western Hemisphere, founded by artist John Trumbull with his donation of 100 depictions of the American Revolution. An original \\\\\"Picture Gallery\\\\\" designed by Trumbull was demolished in 1901. The museum now has two parts: the 1928 Tuscan Romanesque building by Swartwout and the newer, mostly glass gallery designed by Kahn in 1953 and renovated in 2006 by The Polshek Partnership Architects. The gallery is known for its encyclopedic collection, especially Early Italian Painting, African Sculpture, and Modern Art. It is free and open to the public. AIAFullscreen Connecticut barns: The Connecticut structures used for curing tobacco are often called barns, although properly these are sheds, as in New England the term \\\\\"barn\\\\\" references the housing of livestock. While curing sheds are found up and down the Connecticut River Valley, Connecticut\\'s sheds cured shade-grown broad leaf tobacco as a wrapping for cigars. Design elements common to tobacco shed design are gabled roofs, frame construction, and some system of ventilation. Commonly, venting relies on attaching hinges to some of the cladding boards so that they can be opened. AIAFullscreen Hotchkiss Memorial Library (Sharon Bruce Price, Architect): Endowed by Maria Bissell Hotchkiss and designed by prominent New York architect Bruce Price in the Romanesque Revival style, the Hotchkiss Memorial Library is located on and complements Sharon\\'s Historic Town Green. The library opened in 1893. Price is known for his construction of the first 13 houses at the exclusive Tuxedo Park, N.Y., enclave, one of the first gated communities in the United States. He also designed the Chateau Frontenac in Quebec and several of the Canadian Pacific hotels. AIAFullscreen Norfolk Library (George Keller, Architect): Established in 1889 by Miss Isabella Eldridge as a memorial to her parents, the Norfolk Library has maintained the character its donor envisioned both as a public library and meeting place for the community. Designed by the Hartford architect George Keller in 1888, the library is an outstanding example of Shingle Style architecture. At the time it was built, the structure went no farther than the north-south corridor of alcoves. The Great Hall, additional stacks and the back alcove, also designed by Keller, were added in 1911, also the gift of Isabella Eldridge. Architectural highlights include the stone exterior, the fish scale tile shingles on the second floor, and the owl-shaped gargoyle adorning the front porch. AIAFullscreen Gillette Castle (William Gillette): Gillette Castle sits on a promontory with commanding views up and down the Connecticut River. Built in 1919, the castle was originally the private residence of William Gillette, a well-known actor of his day, most famous for his portrayals of Sherlock Holmes. Without any formal training in architecture, Gillette was responsible for the castle design; the result is charmingly quirky and full of the very personal touches of a dramatic and creative mind. Gillette tried his hand at the design of everything in the castle down to the door knobs and a system of hidden mirrors for surveillance of the public rooms from the master bedroom. The castle is now a state park and is open to the public. AIAFullscreen Goodspeed Opera House (Jabez Comstock, Architect): Merchant and banker William Goodspeed built the opera house from a design by Jabez Comstock between 1876 and 1877. This landmark was born as a distinctive Second Empire Style building along the Connecticut River and is actually a theater, not an opera house. Along with its upper-level theater, it has had many lives: general store, office, steamship docking point, militia base and storage facility for the State Highway Department until restored in 1959 by Goodspeed Musicals. AIAFullscreen Yale Center for British Art (Louis I. Kahn, Architect): Designed by Louis I. Kahn and completed after Kahn\\'s death in 1974, the Yale Center for British Art was the first museum in the United States to incorporate retail shops in its design. It is designed to allow as much natural light as possible with an exterior of matte steel and reflective glass and interior of travertine marble, white oak and Belgian linen. As part of an educational institution, it includes exhibition and storage space for paintings, sculpture, drawings and prints; a rare book collection; a research library; a photograph archive; an auditorium; classrooms; workshops and offices; and conservation facilities. Its recent renovation is by George Knight Architects. AIAFullscreen The Ellie Mitchell Pavilion of Rocky Neck State Park (Russell F. Baker, Architect, and others): Completed in 1936 as part of the Depression-era Works Progress Administration (WPA), the curved rustic structure stands 350 feet long by 80 feet wide and is fashioned from stone and timber collected from local quarries and the site. The impressive cobblestone structure with stone fireplaces and native wood pillars sits atop a rocky bluff with views to Long Island Sound. AIAFullscreen New London Public Library (Henry Hobson Richardson, Architect): The library was designed by Henry Hobson Richardson in 1889 and opened in 1891 thanks to a $65,000 gift from Henry P. Haven, a successful local whaling and shipping merchant. Work on the library was overseen by the Boston architectural firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge. Its cladding is pink granite from Worcester, Mass., with Kibbe sandstone appointments and trim. The original reading room is paneled in oak up to the height of 13 feet and has heavy oak beams. The structure is full of Richardson\\'s grand and delightful Romanesque features: arches, groin vaults, and even a tympanum of carved stone with the New London Seal, a ship under full sail. AIAFullscreen Nathan Hale Homestead (Deacon Richard Hale): The Nathan Hale Homestead was built in 1777 by Deacon Richard Hale for his son, Nathan Hale, the American Revolution hero who was hanged as a spy by the British in 1776. The Georgian-style home was first occupied by Hale\\'s widow and family before being saved from destruction and restored by George Dudley Seymour in the early 20th century. Today the site is part of the Nathan Hale State Forest and is the site of civil war reenactments, a farmer\\'s market, and other activities. AIAFullscreen Roseland Cottage (Joseph C. Wells, Architect): Roseland Cottage, the summer home of the Henry C. Bowen family, was built in 1846 in the Gothic Revival style, with steep gables and ornamented chimney pots. Designed by English-born Joseph C. Wells, the entire complex features a picturesque landscape that includes original boxwood-edged parterre gardens planted in the 1850s and reflects some of the principles of Andrew Jackson Downing, sometimes called the \\\\\"father \\\\\"of American landscape architecture. AIAFullscreen Windham Bridge (William Grover, FAIA, Architect): On a hot, dry summer\\'s night in 1754, a thunderous uproar from the darkness surrounding the town sent the Willimantic locals into a general panic. It turned out to be bullfrogs in search of water who were driven to this spot on the Willimantic River by a long-standing drought. The 500-foot Windham Bridge, adorned with tall bullfrogs atop thread spools, and also known as the Thread City Crossing, commemorates the event and celebrates the town\\'s textile history. Designed by William Grover, FAIA and opened in 2000, its bronze sculptures are by Leo Jenson. AIAFullscreen Hill-Stead Museum (Theodate Pope Riddle, Architect): The Hill-Stead Museum, a National Historic Landmark, is a Colonial Revival house and art museum set in a 250-acre estate. Built in 1901, it was designed by Theodate Pope Riddle, one of the United States\\' first female architects, with Egerton Swartwout of McKim, Mead & White. Hill-Stead was created as a country estate for Riddle\\'s father, wealthy industrialist Alfred Atmore Pope, and contains the French Impressionist masterpieces collected by Pope and Riddle. Riddle inherited Hill-Stead after the death of her parents and designated it as a museum \\\\\"for the benefit and enjoyment of the public.\\\\\" AIAFullscreenLike this topic?

It is the only state capitol building with five domes. The building houses the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Governor and other elected officials. It has been undergoing a series of phased restoration projects since 1983. Mark MickunasFullscreen Eagle Point Park Shelters (Alfred Caldwell): A remarkable example of Prairie School landscape architecture, the designer referred to the plan as \\\\\"The City in a Garden.\\\\\" The park pavilions are constructed of a horizontal limestone similar to Frank Lloyd Wright\\'s Taliesin buildings, appearing to grow from the ground. Cameron CampbellFullscreen Council Bluffs Free Public Library\\\\/Union Pacific Railroad Museum (Patton & Miller): The Council Bluffs Free Public Library is a two-story Beaux Arts Classical, Carnegie Foundation-funded public library. Built in 1904-05, the library is located on the fringe of Council Bluffs\\' Downtown Business District. The structure has been well maintained and in continuous use as a library since it was built. In 1953, the side entrance on the north was closed and the stoop was removed. In conjunction with closing the north entrance, the interior was remodeled with new flooring and doors. In 1984, the windows were weatherized and stained glass panes were removed and placed in storage. SmallbonesFullscreen High Trestle Trail Bridge (RDG Planning and Design): The public art integration for a bridge that crosses the Des Moines River represents a tour de force in the combination and coordination of art, architecture and engineering. The installation is the centerpiece that connects over 600 miles of trail. It has become a destination icon and new cultural landmark. Kun ZhangFullscreen Chicago Burlington Quincy Station (Holabird & Root): This railroad station is one of the first Iowa buildings done in International-style modernism. It is completely stripped of ornament and relies on its form and material to provide design interest. Its construction during World War II may have created the opportunity to eliminate decorative features. Cameron CampbellFullscreen Lowell Walter House (Frank Lloyd Wright): The Cedar Rock House, also known as the Lowell Walter House, was completed in 1945 in Quasqueton, Iowa. Nearly everything at Cedar Rock bears the architect\\'s imprint. Wright designed the furniture, selected the carpets, chose the draperies and even picked out the accessories. Cedar Rock was begun in 1948 and completed in 1950. Its roof and floors are concrete; the walls are brick, glass and walnut. Of all the Wright designs in Iowa, Cedar Rock is the only home chosen by Wright to bear his coveted signature tile. When Walter died in August of 1981, he and his wife, Agnes, left their home to the Iowa Conservation Commission and the people of Iowa. Wikipedia\\\\/Orange Suede SofaFullscreen American Enterprise Group Corporate Headquarters (SOM\\'s Gordon Bunshaft, BNIM Architects):The American Enterprise Group (AEG) corporate headquarters is an eight-story office building in downtown Des Moines. The venerable building, designed by SOM\\'s Gordon Bunshaft, was completed in 1965 and received an AIA Honor Award for Architecture in 1967. In 1966, it was featured in LIFE magazine and deemed \\\\\"the talk of the Midwest.\\\\\" The project is being considered for the National Register of Historic Places; improvements were made utilizing historic documents and the Secretary of the Interior\\'s Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings. Nick Merrick Hedrich BlessingFullscreen Des Moines Art Center (Saarinen Swanson & Saarinen Architects and Brooks Borg, Architects-Engineers, I. M. Pei & Partners, Richard Meier, Knowles Blunck Architecture): The Des Moines Art Center is a nationally renowned museum complex. It is a sublimely beautiful project that defers to the landscape of the park, nestling into the hill, creating a front parking court and rear sculpture court. Cameron CampbellFullscreen Reiman Gardens (Coe Lee Robinson Roesch, Inc., Rodney Robinson Landscape Architects, Architects Smith Metzger): Situated on a 17-acre site in Ames, Reiman Gardens offers a year-round destination featuring distinct gardens, always changing, adapting and evolving with the seasons. In addition to yearly themes, special events, and an ever-changing display of natural beauty, the Gardens also offers a tropical indoor conservatory with seasonal displays, a 2,500-square-foot Butterfly Wing with 800 exotic butterflies in flight, and a gift shop. Coe Lee Robinson Roesch, Inc., Rodney Robinson Landscape Architects, Architects Smith MetzgerFullscreen C. Y. Stephens Auditorium, Iowa State University (Crites & McConnell and Brooks Borg & Skiles): This is both an impressive example of sculptural high modernism and a strong commitment to the cultural life of Iowa. The auditorium is an icon on the Iowa State University campus and is skillfully designed for viewing a broad range of performances. Cameron CampbellFullscreen Principal Riverwalk Hub Spot (Substance Architecture): This 2,200-square-foot pavilion and plaza occupy a prominent site along the Des Moines River in downtown Des Moines. The building is a key part of the new Principal Riverwalk - a public\\\\/private partnership which revitalized the riverfront and draws Des Moines\\' residents back to the river. The building sits adjacent to a new recreational trail, street-level promenade and riverfront promenade anchoring the west end of the historic Court Avenue Bridge. Paul CrosbyFullscreen Merchants National Bank Building (Louis H. Sullivan): One of Sullivan\\'s most important bank buildings, virtually every architecture student in the country has studied it for over 70 years. The simple exterior box has a stunning terra-cotta entry and the interior is lit with a large stained glass side window and skylight. Cameron CampbellFullscreen Salisbury House (Boyd & Moore and Rasmussen & Wayland): This historic house museum, built in the 1920s for a wealthy Midwestern businessman and his family, is modeled after the 16th-century King\\'s House in Salisbury, England. Parts of the home are historic artifacts from England, enhancing the period effect. The interior public rooms are exquisite and the surrounding landscape augments the feel of the manor home. Cameron CampbellFullscreen Hancher Auditorium, University of Iowa (OPN Architects, Inc. and Pelli Clarke Pelli): In June 2008, the University of Iowa incurred significant damage to campus buildings due to the flooding of the Iowa River. Of those buildings flooded, the Voxman Music Building, Hancher and Clapp Recital Hall were all damaged and determined by FEMA eligible for replacement. In February 2010, OPN Architects was selected as the Architect-of-Record for the design of a new Hancher replacement building. Shortly thereafter, the University of Iowa and OPN selected internationally acclaimed Pelli Clarke Pelli as the design architect. The original building was designed by Max Abramovitz (1972), and stood as an icon, symbolizing the arts for the University, the community and the State of Iowa. It is the desire of the University for the replacement facility to carry that same distinction. The replacement of the existing Hancher facility will have a large multi-purpose proscenium theater, as well as a smaller performance space for rehearsals, performance and teaching. The building program requires front-of-house and back-of-house support spaces and administrative offices. The larger theater space will accommodate commercial productions including music, dance, opera and theatrical works. OPN Architects, Inc. and Pelli Clarke PelliFullscreen Cedar Rapids Public Library (OPN Architects, Inc.): In June 2008 a destructive flood swept through Cedar Rapids. Hundreds of homes and businesses were lost, including some of the city\\'s most prominent public structures such as the Courthouse, the City Hall and the 25-year old Public Library. The loss of the library was particularly devastating. Everything on the first floor of the 85,000 square foot facility - which occupied a city block - was lost to the flood, including the entire adult and youth collections, public-access computers, computer labs, and a state-of-the-art check-out system. The new 95,000-square-foot library is designed to be a vibrant, multipurpose destination and a space for the community to mix and collaborate. The design of the new library was driven by the desire to embrace openness, transparency and foster public engagement with and within the space. OPN Architects, Inc.Fullscreen University of Iowa Old State Capitol (OPN Architects, Inc. and Einhorn Yaffee Prescott): Construction of the Old Capitol began in 1839. The Greek revival building served as the first capitol of the Iowa Territory and the State of Iowa. In the 1840s the State\\'s capital was moved to Des Moines, and it became the first structure of the University of Iowa. In November 2001 a fire destroyed the dome, cupola and bell tower, and caused extensive damage to the interior. The restoration work included reconstructing and repairing the fire-damaged items. OPN Architects, Inc. and Einhorn Yaffee PrescottFullscreen Carver-Hawkeye Arena, University of Iowa (Caudill Rowlett Scott Architects): The primary concern of the building is the long span roof, so here it becomes the most expressive part of the design. The suspended-roof plane appears to float as you enter the impressive interior arena carved into the ground plane. Cameron CampbellFullscreen Visual Arts Building, University of Iowa (Steven Holl Architects and BNIM Architects): The new Visual Arts Building for the University of Iowa\\'s School of Art and Art History provides 126,000 square feet of loft-like space for all visual arts media, from ancient metalsmithing techniques to the most advanced virtual reality technologies. The building replaces an original arts building from 1936, which was heavily damaged during the 2008 flood of the University of Iowa campus. The new building forms an Arts Quad with Art Building West, which was also designed by Steven Holl Architects, and has drawn students from all over campus to its social spaces and library since opening in 2006. Iwan BaanFullscreen Des Moines Central Public Library (David Chipperfield Architects, Herbert Lewis Kruse Blunck Architecture): The Des Moines Public Library\\'s Central Library, completed in 2006, serves as the anchor for the quickly developing Western Gateway Park area in Des Moines. Architect David Chipperfield envisioned the building as \\\\\"a library in a park; a park in a library.\\\\\" As part of that design, the library features a sedum roof and copper windows that allow for daylight to come through 95% of its interior spaces. The windows are made of three layers - two glass layers with Okalux copper mesh in between. It was the first building in the world to use copper mesh glazed panel windows. Christian RichtersFullscreen Joshua Melson House (Walter Burley Griffin): The Melson House, constructed from 1912-1914, was the first house in the Rock Crest Rock Glen neighborhood to be built on the south side of the development. It was dubbed \\\\\"the castle\\\\\" because of the textured stone fa\\\\u00e7ade, quarried from the site. The Melson House is a two-story ashlar structure set on a limestone cliff, overlooking the creek. The home is conceptually meant to appear as if it is literally growing out of its natural surroundings. The four corner piers and the poured concrete window mullions help to emphasize the vertical movement on the facade, straying from typical horizontal emphasis of the prairie style. Like many homes in the neighborhood, the Melson House is square in plan, with the exception of a protruding two-car garage on the south side. The interior layout is open, with little addition of walls except to delineate service space. National Park ServiceFullscreen Charles Medbury Hall and Oreon E. Scott Chapel, Drake University (Eero Saarinen & Associates): A modestly scaled pair of buildings, the brick chapel is designed to sit in a courtyard similar to Renaissance church examples in Italy. The chapel interior is one of the most astounding modern spaces in the state, leading the visitor to a meditative experience. Cameron CampbellFullscreen Park Inn Hotel and City National Bank Building (Frank Lloyd Wright, Bergland + Cram): The Park Inn Hotel and City National Bank Building is Wright\\'s only non-residential design in Iowa. The building was occupied and remodeled by dozens of commercial and residential entities and eventually deteriorated over time due to lack of maintenance. Fast-forward to the 21st century, after a restoration effort spanning 12 years and costing $18 million dollars, the hotel was rehabilitated to include 27 historically inspired guest rooms, 8,000 square feet of conference space, various lounge areas, and a restaurant. Cameron CampbellFullscreen Art Building West. University of Iowa (Steven Knoll Architects): The building combines two academic disciplines -- studio arts and art history -- under one roof. The interiors flow into one another and overlap in public areas that act as \\\\\"social condensers\\\\\" for people and activities. The various activities are informally distributed around a central atrium and the dramatic suspended stair of folded steel plates. Andy RyanFullscreen Woodbury County Courthouse (William Steele and Purcell & Elmslie): The largest Prairie Style public building in Iowa, it is distinguished by a horizontal base with the tower above. The detailing is both intimate and meticulous. It is an example of an enlightened community creating modern public image. Cameron CampbellFullscreen The World Food Prize - Hall of Laureates (RDG Planning and Design, Gensler Architecture, Hoerr Schaudt Landscape Architecture): This magnificently restored Beaux Arts space celebrates the spirit of giving, emphasizing the importance of global food security. The building also pays tribute to the World Food Prize Laureates and Iowa\\'s agricultural and humanitarian pioneers for their significant contributions to the global fight against hunger and helping to feed the world and improve the lives of others.

100 meters, while altitudes between 100 and 200 meters will be reserved for non-accommodation-based tourism projects.\\\\n\\\\nThe eastern and northeastern parts of the peninsula, home to a dense

where law enforcement, pharmaceutical companies and industry experts join together to tackle the severe problem of illegal drug manufacturing began in Hanoi today.\\\\n\\\\nThe two day conference will focus on law enforcement strategies to stop the manufacture of deadly amphetamines such as methylamphetamine and MDMA, commonly referred to as ice and ecstasy, respectively.\\\\n\\\\nIn recent years in Vietnam there has been a substantial increase in the use of synthetic drugs such as MDMA. Methylamphetamine continues to be a problem, Colonel Hoang Anh Tuyen from the Ministry of Public Security said.\\\\n\\\\nThe hope is that this summit will enhance our offensive on the drug trade both here in Vietnam and throughout Asia. With industry and law enforcement working with each other, we can tighten controls on precursor chemicals which makes it harder for criminals to trade in these illicit substances.\\\\n\\\\nThe conference brings together agencies committed to preventing the diversion of precursor chemicals into the illegal manufacture of amphetamines.\\\\n\\\\nThis involves a range of groups from law enforcement agencies who investigate and prosecute those who produce and sell the drugs, to the laboratories who make the drugs, the companies who make the glassware necessary in the illegal \\'cooking\\' process, to the pharmacists who sell over-the-counter pseudoephedrine products.\\\\n\\\\nAll these groups throughout Vietnam and Asia need to work together in order to be one step ahead of the criminal networks that manufacture and sell these deadly drugs, noted Colonel Tuyen.\\\\n\\\\nJeremy Douglas, regional representative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for Southeast Asia and Pacific, introduced some proposed legislation to prevent pseudoephedrine products being accessible to the public other than by prescription.\\\\n\\\\nIt included a centralized pharmacy database system that would provide pharmacists with an enhanced ability to identify suspicious requests for pseudoephedrine-containing medications.\\\\n\\\\nThe legislation aims to put an end to the criminal practice of \\'pseudo running\\'.\\\\n\\\\nPseudo running involves criminals obtaining the pseudoephedrine products from pharmacies using fake identities, usually along planned routes throughout the entire Asian region.\\\\n\\\\nIdeally, if all pharmacies could be registered and a collective database properly implemented and utilized, that would help we in law enforcement prevent diversion of products for illicit purposes.\\\\n\\\\nBetter legislation is also needed to address the increasing patterns of freight theft of precursor chemicals around the globe, Mr Douglas added.\\\\n\\\\nThe drug policies currently in place in Vietnam and Asian aren\\'t working, so we need a fresh look by delegates at this summit to look at best alternative strategies to minimize the harm that the illegal drugs such as ice and ecstasy cause to society.\\\\n\\\\nArt performance exchange tightens Vietnam, Malaysia relations\\\\n\\\\nAn art performance exchange between Vietnam and Malaysia was held on August 29 in Hanoi to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Malaysia\\'s National Day (August 31) and the 72nd anniversary of Vietnam\\'s National Day (September 2).\\\\n\\\\nThe event, organised by the Vietnam Union of Friendship Organisations (VUFO) and the Malaysian Embassy in Vietnam, consisted of 13 traditional singing and dancing performances of Vietnam and Malaysia\\'s Pahang state.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking at the event, VUFO Secretary General and Vice President Don Tuan Phong said the Malaysian art troupe\\'s visit will help strengthen friendship between Vietnam and Malaysia\\'s people, thus contributing to relations between the two countries.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam-Malaysia ties have developed tremendously, said Phong, adding that Malaysia is Vietnam\\'s seventh biggest trading partner and investor with two-way trade of 8.4 billion USD in 2016 and total investment of 12 billion USD in the first five months of 2017.\\\\n\\\\nThe two countries have also boosted relations in culture, sports and tourism, labour cooperation and high-level delegation exchanges, Phong noted.\\\\n\\\\nHe expressed his belief that cooperation between the two countries will further develop for peace, stability and development in Southeast Asia and the world.\\\\n\\\\nFor his part, Malaysian Ambassador to Vietnam Mohd Zamruni Bin Khalid emphasised the friendship of Vietnam and Malaysia, saying that the establishment of their strategic partnership in 2015 was a success in bilateral cooperation enhancement.\\\\n\\\\nHe noted that the art performance of the Malaysian art troupe is an activity to realise the two side\\'s strategic cooperation plan, contributing to the development of a harmonious ASEAN.\\\\n\\\\nTraining workshop for teachers in science GLOBE programme\\\\n\\\\nA training workshop for teachers of the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) 2017 programme was held on August 29 in Hanoi to help launch the programme in Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\nThe event was organised by the Vietnam Space Centre of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, the Asia-Pacific GLOBE office and the Centre for Education and Development (CED).\\\\n\\\\nIt provided secondary and high school teachers in Hanoi with knowledge about environmental topics such as atmosphere, soil and hydrosphere, said Vu Anh Tuan, National Coordinator of GLOBE programme in Vietnam.\\\\n\\\\nGLOBE, sponsored by the US\\'s NASA, is an international science and education programme.

He heard mortar shells and helicopters where there were none. He couldn\\'t sleep and drank until he passed out. He got every treatment offered by Veterans Affairs for post-traumatic stress disorder. But they didn\\'t stop him from trying to kill himself - five times.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, he signed up for an experimental therapy and was given a little green capsule. The anguish stopped.\\\\n\\\\nInside that pill was a compound named MDMA, better known by dealers and rave party-goers as ecstasy. That street drug is emerging as the most promising tool to come along in years for the military\\'s escalating PTSD epidemic.\\\\n\\\\nThe MDMA programme was created by a small group of psychedelic researchers who had toiled for years in the face of ridicule, funding shortages and scepticism. But the results have been so positive that this month the Food and Drug Administration deemed it a \\\\\"breakthrough therapy\\\\\" - setting it on a fast track for review and potential approval.\\\\n\\\\nThe prospect of a government-sanctioned psychedelic drug has generated both excitement and concern. And it has opened the door to scientists studying new uses for other illegal psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin (commonly known as magic mushrooms).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We\\'re in this odd situation where one of the most promising therapies also happens to be a Schedule 1 substance banned by the [Drug Enforcement Administration],\\\\\" said retired Brigadier General Loree Sutton, who until 2010 was the highest-ranking psychiatrist in the US Army.\\\\n\\\\nBecause of the stigma attached to psychedelics since the trippy 1960s, many military and government leaders still hesitate to embrace them. Some scientists are also wary of the nonprofit spearheading ecstasy therapy, a group with the stated goal of making the banned drugs part of mainstream culture.\\\\n\\\\nBut the scope and severity of PTSD makes it all irrelevant, said Sutton, who now works as New York City\\'s commissioner of veteran services. \\\\\"If this is something that could really save lives, we need to run and not walk toward it. We need to follow the data.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nPTSD has been a problem for the military for decades, but America\\'s recent wars have pushed it to epidemic-level heights. Experts estimate between 11 and 20 percent of soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.\\\\n\\\\nThe affliction is typically triggered after experiencing or witnessing violence, including assault and abuse. It has ravaged lives and broken up marriages. It often leaves its victims in sudden panic and prevents them from dealing with the original trauma.\\\\n\\\\nRead more Fear erased from mice brains in step towards new PTSD treatment\\\\n\\\\nAnd that last symptom is what makes PTSD particularly hard to overcome with traditional talk therapy. Because patients can\\'t talk about and process the trauma, experts say, it lingers like a poison in their mind.\\\\n\\\\nOnly two drugs are approved for treating PTSD: Zoloft and Paxil. Both have proved largely ineffective when it comes to veterans, whose cases are especially difficult to resolve because of their prolonged or repeated exposure to combat.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"If you\\'re a combat veteran with multiple tours of duty, the chance of a good response to these drugs is one in three, maybe lower,\\\\\" said John Krystal, chairman of psychiatry at Yale University and a director at the VA\\'s National Center for PTSD. \\\\\"That\\'s why there\\'s so much frustration and interest in finding something that works better.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nEcstasy has long been a favourite at trance parties and raves because of its unique ability to flood users with intense feelings of euphoria. But as a byproduct, it also reduces fear and imbues users with a deep sense of love and acceptance of themselves and others - the perfect conditions for trauma therapy.\\\\n\\\\nBy giving doses of MDMA at the beginning of three, eight-hour therapy sessions, researchers say they have helped chronic PTSD patients process and move past their traumas.\\\\n\\\\nIn clinical trials with 107 patients closely monitored by the FDA, 61 percent reported major reductions in symptoms - to the point where they no longer fit the criteria for PTSD. Follow-up studies a year later found 67 percent no longer had PTSD.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"If you were to design the perfect drug to treat PTSD, MDMA would be it,\\\\\" said Rick Doblin, who three decades ago founded the California nonprofit behind the clinical trials.\\\\n\\\\nIt is no accident that the group - the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) - chose PTSD as its argument for ending the government\\'s ban on psychedelics.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We wanted to help a population that would automatically win public sympathy,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"No one\\'s going to argue against the need to help them.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nDoblin, now 63, talks openly about his own history with drugs. He began tripping on LSD as a rebellious, long-haired college freshman in the 1970s. He says it helped him see the world and himself in new ways. He wanted to become a therapist and use psychedelics to help others achieve similar insights, but he couldn\\'t because LSD was already banned.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The flaw of the early psychedelic movement was that they made it counter-cultural, a revolution,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"Culture is dominant. Culture is always going to win.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFor a decade, he worked in construction until he came across MDMA for the first time. When the DEA moved to criminalise it in 1984, Doblin created MAPS and sued the agency. The lawsuit failed, and Doblin realised that psychedelics were perceived as too fringe to win public support.\\\\n\\\\nTo succeed, he decided, both he and the issue had to go mainstream.\\\\n\\\\nDoblin talked his way into the public policy PhD programme at Harvard University and learned to navigate the federal bureaucracy. He shaved off his moustache, cut his shaggy hair and learned to dress up.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I used to laugh about how simple it was,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"You put on a suit, and suddenly everyone thinks you\\'re fine.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe external switch reflected an internal one as well. Instead of fighting government officials, he began plotting to win them over, especially those at the FDA.\\\\n\\\\nAnd the key, he realised, was science.\\\\n\\\\nBefore the FDA would even talk about clinical trials for MDMA, the agency needed proof it wasn\\'t dangerous. Previous studies suggesting its neurotoxicity had been limited to rats. So in 1986, Doblin scraped together money to buy monkeys for those same researchers, who found the risks to be much less at human-equivalent doses than previously thought.\\\\n\\\\nThe next step was investigating MDMA\\'s effects on people. Doblin again raised money to fly psychedelic users he had befriended to Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University for spinal taps. The studies were approved by review boards at both institutions. Doblin also participated, undergoing two spinal taps.\\\\n\\\\nIn the two decades that followed, Doblin and MAPS inched toward progress.\\\\n\\\\nThe nonprofit grew from a one-man band to a staff of 25 with headquarters in Santa Cruz. It tapped into the scene in Silicon Valley - where many tech entrepreneurs have used psychedelics to spark creativity. (Steve Jobs famously praised LSD as \\\\\"one of the two or three most important things I have done in my life.\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nMAPS received a $5.5 million bequest from the founder of a software company. The hipster soap company Dr Bronner\\'s pledged $5 million. A professional poker player who attributed his wins to microdosing on LSD gave $25,000. Recently, an anonymous $21,000 bitcoin donation came in.\\\\n\\\\nMuch of that money funded small-scale clinical trials, which laid the groundwork for the last remaining hurdle: Large-scale \\\\\"phase 3\\\\\" trials that will begin next year, involving 200 to 300 patients in 14 locations.\\\\n\\\\nIf those future trials yield similar results, the FDA could approve the MDMA treatment for PTSD as soon as 2021, according to Doblin.\\\\n\\\\nYet his dream extends beyond that. He envisions a future where psychedelic treatment centres are in every city - places people can visit for enhanced couples therapy, spiritual experiences and personal growth. He believes psychedelics can help address the country\\'s biggest problems, from homelessness and war to global warming.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"These drugs are a tool that can make people more compassionate, tolerant, more connected with other humans and the planet itself,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nThat kind of talk makes many in the medical community nervous.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s hard to measure the exact dangers of ecstasy. Because it is not used as widely as marijuana or cocaine, for example, fewer statistics are available on overdoses or injuries. In 2011, a public health monitoring system identified 22,498 emergency department visits nationwide related to ecstasy.\\\\n\\\\nMDMA researchers point out that one key difference between MDMA and street ecstasy (along with another variant called \\\\\"molly\\\\\") is the street versions often contain other harmful drugs, experts say. Sometimes the pills don\\'t even contain MDMA.\\\\n\\\\nBut even in its purest clinical form, MDMA can pose risks. At high doses, it can cause the body to overheat. It can cause anxiety and increase the stress hormone cortisol. Chronic use can also cause memory impairment.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I think it\\'s a dangerous substance,\\\\\" said Andrew Parrott, a psychology professor at Swansea University in Wales who spent years researching the drug\\'s harmful effects. He worries FDA approval for the treatment of PTSD could lead many in the public to believe ecstasy is safe for recreational use.\\\\n\\\\nOther experts, however, have become increasingly intrigued by its promising results.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Anytime you have an organisation that is advocating for drugs that are illegal, it marginalises them in the research field. MAPS still isn\\'t seen as mainstream. But it\\'s possible they have a point here,\\\\\" said Krystal, the Yale psychiatrist, who has not been involved with the group\\'s research. \\\\\"I can\\'t think of a single medication that doesn\\'t carry some side effect. The question here is whether the benefits outweigh the risk.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFor Lubecky, the drug can\\'t be approved fast enough.\\\\n\\\\nThe Marine Corps and Army veteran recalls coming home from Iraq in 2006 to discover his wife had left him, sold his motorcycle and taken his dog. That, coupled with the trauma of what he had saw at war, sent him over the edge.\\\\n\\\\nOn Christmas Eve, he put the muzzle of his Beretta to his temple and pulled the trigger. The gun malfunctioned, he said, \\\\\"but that microsecond after the hammer fell is when I finally felt at peace because I knew the pain would finally be over.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOne incident in Iraq in particular tormented him - a shot he took while protecting his unit. \\\\\"It was a situation where the right thing to do was the immoral thing,\\\\\" he said, declining to describe it in detail. \\\\\"You\\'re looking through a scope at another human being and you do one thing and suddenly they don\\'t exist anymore.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFor years he told no one about it. He would panic even thinking about it.\\\\n\\\\nAfter he was accepted into the MDMA clinical trial in South Carolina, he found himself on a futon with two counselors on either side as the effects of the drug sank in.\\\\n\\\\nWorld news in pictures 117 show all World news in pictures 1\\\\/117 29 August 2017\\\\n\\\\nRetiring paramilitary policemen prepare for a group photo before retirement in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, China\\\\n\\\\nReuters\\\\/Stringer\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\/117 28 August 2017\\\\n\\\\nThe sun sets on the playa as approximately 70,000 people from all over the world gathered for the annual Burning Man arts and music festival in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada\\\\n\\\\nReuters\\\\/Jim Urquhart\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\/117 27 August 2017\\\\n\\\\nA member of Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) tells a Rohingya girl not to come on Bangladesh side.

I do not think that it will be difficult to implement. The difficulty lies in making a decision.

Volker stressed that ending the war in the Donbas is a key requirement for improving US-Russian relations. \\\\\"In Hamburg, President Trump told President Putin that we will not be able to strengthen or improve US-Russian relations until the conflict in Ukraine is resolved, which hinders the establishment of bilateral relations ... For Trump, the conflict in Ukraine is one of the main obstacles to the improvement of relations between the US and Russia. Of course, this is not the only problem,\\\\\" the US ambassador said. In his opinion, only political will is needed to end the war. \\\\\"Are going to solve this problem or not? If we are going to, then we can use the Minsk process for it. But first we need to develop a decision-making system. We do not currently have one; therefore, the Normandy format has not given the expected result,\\\\\" said Volker. On July 7, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appointed Volker, the former US ambassador to NATO, as Special Representative for Ukraine. He will coordinate the efforts of the State Department to resolve the conflict in Ukraine.

All that is happening illustrates the already overcrowded chronicle of Ukraine\\'s loss of sovereignty and transformation into an externally governed territory,\\\\\" Yarovaya said, as cited by her press service. The deputy said that the invasion of \\\\\"NATO and company\\\\\" began much earlier, and that \\\\\"the seeds of Russophobia, ignorance and disrespect for the common ancestor history, ignorance and nationalism\\\\\" had already been artificially sown and cultivated in Ukraine. \\\\\"The Donbas did not succumb to such a policy of self-destruction. The question of whether parade processions will be converted into aggressive everyday life is, unfortunately, rhetorical,\\\\\" Yarovaya concluded. In Kyiv on August 24 there was a military parade for the Day of Independence. Military personnel of all kinds from the Armed Forces of Ukraine and ally states took part in the parade. Notably, the parade involved soldiers from Great Britain, the USA, Canada, Georgia, Romania, Moldova, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, a total of 231 soldiers. Defense Ministers from nine countries and one deputy minister of defense also came to the parade.

This week, the prominent Russian sociologist and dissident Igor Eidman, who resides in Germany, started a Facebook group aimed at countering Kremlin propaganda in that country. \\\\\"We are the Russian speakers of Germany,\\\\\" he wrote in the post announcing the group. \\\\\"And we are outraged that the Putin regime is attempting to speak in our name.\\\\\" And Eidman isn\\'t the only Russian living abroad who is representative of the Other Russian World. WATCH: Today\\'s Daily Vertical In Riga, Anton Lysenkov, a former journalist for Lenta.ru, has started a smart online magazine called Spektr that is dedicated to countering the narratives on Russian state television and providing Russian speakers in the Baltics with honest and high-quality reporting, analysis, and commentary in their native language. Galina Timchenko and her team at the Riga-based Meduza news site are likewise performing a similar service. And then there is State Duma Deputy Ilya Ponomaryov, the only Russian lawmaker to vote against the annexation of Crimea. He now resides in Kyiv, where he not only pushes back against Russian propaganda but has also become a constructive voice on Ukrainian politics as well. The list can go on. As Russia\\'s best and brightest minds emigrate in increasing numbers, they are often making their new homes in places like the Baltics and Ukraine. They\\'re speaking out against Vladimir Putin\\'s regime, making constructive contributions to their new homes, and demonstrating that Russians abroad are not a monolithic pro-Kremlin bloc. And as this trend continues, the term \\\\\"Russky mir\\\\\" is taking on a whole new -- and much less menacing -- meaning.\\\\n\\\\nAlexander Golts | War in Ukraine Ruined Russian Military Reform (Op-Ed)\\\\n\\\\nI have stated several times before in this column that Moscow\\'s secret war in eastern and southern Ukraine is having a devastating impact on Russia\\'s armed forces. It not only throws into question the results of the successful military reforms that former Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov carried out in 2008-2011, but it is doing so much more quickly than I would have imagined possible. The site Gazeta.ru published a sensational investigation reporting that dozens of soldiers from the 33rd Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade stationed in Maikop left their military unit last fall and now stand accused of desertion. The contract soldiers claim they had to leave the Kadamovsky training area due to inhuman living conditions and pressure from superiors to go serve as volunteers in the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk people\\'s republics in Ukraine.As expected, the Russian military command vehemently denied everything. However, even official data indicates that the Maikop Garrison Court convicted 62 soldiers in the first half of 2015 on charges of \\\\\"leaving their units without permission,\\\\\" but convicted only about half that number, 35, on the same charges in the four years between 2010 to 2014. What could have caused such a surge in desertions? It is also worth noting that the 33rd Brigade was formed in 2005 by presidential decree and was intended to become an elite mountain unit. All of the soldiers under investigation were contract personnel, not conscripts. They had made a conscious decision to pursue that line of work. One of those named in the Gazeta.ru report had fairly recently completed his mandatory term of service as a conscript before signing his contract, while another had served as a seaman for seven years aboard the nuclear-powered cruiser \\\\\"Peter the Great.\\\\\" In other words, they had a good idea of what to expect from the Russian army. And then suddenly, they were faced with something quite unexpected. The soldiers of the 33rd Brigade were sent to the training area in fall of last year, at the time when leaders signed the first Minsk agreement. Meanwhile, troops that had taken part in summer battles near Ilovaisk and Mariupol in Ukraine were given time to recover from their tour of duty and it became apparent that there was nobody to replace them. Serdyukov\\'s military reforms created only a limited number of elite units. They were trained to achieve rapid victory on the battlefield, but were never intended to stand for an entire year at the Russian-Ukrainian border. At that time, Russian commanders faced a critical shortage of fresh troops to continue the hybrid war in the Donbass. (Later, in the winter, they brought in a tank battalion stationed in Buryatia to achieve victory near Debaltseve.) However, the soldiers of the 33rd Brigade were clearly not eager to fight in Ukraine. At that point, commanders reverted to the tactics they had used a decade earlier when they received orders to persuade conscripts to sign up as professional contract soldiers, whether by hook or by crook. They achieved that by creating unbearable conditions for the men and presenting contract service as a means of deliverance. In the same way, according to the soldiers of the 33rd Brigade, commanders made life difficult for the soldiers at the Kadamovsky training area by forcing them to sleep on boards and depriving them of adequate food and water, with the result that they suffered from frequent colds. At the same time, various officers showed up offering them the moon in the Donbass: the impossible sum of 8,000 rubles ($142) per day in pay and the status of war veterans upon their return to Russia. However, other men already serving as contract soldiers dissuaded them, explaining that if anything were to happen to them while fighting in Ukraine, army brass would write them off retroactively or declare them deserters who had been killed by land mines while running away, according to Gazeta.ru. If this story is true, it spells the end of Russia\\'s progressive military reforms. The problem is not just that after leaders promised to make military service more humane they once again relegated soldiers to the status of slaves, but that they are now denigrating adult military professionals in addition to 18-year-old conscripts -- that is, the very people who represent the only hope of modernizing and improving this country\\'s armed forces. And those men found no other way to address their concerns than to flee because they did not believe they could achieve justice in Russia. After such an experience, is it realistic to expect them to give their lives for a country that has treated them so shamelessly? The strength of any army lies in the faith the men have in their commander. But in this case, the soldiers firmly believed that their commanders were lying to them about unheard-of salaries in the Donbass and treating them as cannon fodder. These lies started one year ago when leaders began almost officially alleging that Russian soldiers would first request a formal leave of absence before going to fight in Ukraine. That blatant lie was designed to relieve commanders of all responsibility for the lives of their subordinates. However, only the willingness to assume such responsibility forms the basis of military discipline and soldiers\\' readiness to carry out orders. The worst part is that similar outrages probably plague all of Russia\\'s armed forces. That will only reduce the number of people wanting to sign on as professional soldiers. And that means the president will eventually decide to go back to the concept of a mass mobilization army. In the end, what difference would that make, if professional soldiers and conscripts alike are treated as little more than slaves?

Today in the life of Russia is something that we have warned about for a long time. The sectoral and individual sanctions introduced by the US are beginning to have a radical impact on the Russian economy as a whole and on the personal position of the Kremlin\\'s power-lovers. A consequence of this is the increased competition between Kremlin groups and associations. The Kremlin crap begins to devour itself, starting with the tail. Criminal prosecutions and arrests of relatively and absolutely loyal supporters of the Kremlin is a manifestation of the fierce competition of power elites for the disappearing resources. The consequence of this repressive policy will be an even greater concentration of power and the suppression of civil society institutions and democratic mechanisms. The Kremlin is entering the final stage of the development of aggressive imperialism - self-destruction.

The real reason for closing LifeNews is of course an approaching international tribunal regarding the downed Boeing in the Donbass.

By and large this is a clear, conscious destruction of evidence, and all the staff of the Life channel, who prepared and covered the events of July 18, 2015, need to seriously take care of their security.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Modifying 1939 Cartoon of Hitler and Stalin, Moscow Moves \\'from Ideology to Idiocy,\\' Historian Says\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 24 - Yesterday, on the anniversary of the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Lenta.ru news agency published a commentary by Aleksey Isayev who repeated the now-standard line that Stalin had done nothing more than what Western leaders had tried to do in Munich (enta.ru\\\\/articles\\\\/2017\\\\/08\\\\/23\\\\/packt\\\\/). As such, Moscow historian Mark Solonin says, it was totally without interest except for one small detail, the cartoon that Lenta.ru selected to illustrate Isayev\\'s words and the way in which it modified that cartoon to conform to current Russian legislation (solonin.org\\\\/article_ot-ideologii-k-idiotizmu). The British cartoon from 1939 showed Hitler in the form of a bridegroom and Stalin as his bride, with the legend \\\\\"Is It Love or Just Calculation?\\\\\" \\\\\"For half a century,\\\\\" Solonin notes, this cartoon while well-known to specialists could not be published in Soviet newspapers and magazines. But now times have changed: the constitution bans the state from having an ideology, \\\\\"Orthodox chekists stand in church with candles, communists defend the holy image of the little father tsar from the Jewish-Masonic conspiracy,\\\\\" and memorials to Marshal Mannerheim go up and then are pulled down in St. Petersburg, the historian continues. Consequently, there would seem to be no reason for Lenta to refrain from publishing this cartoon, and so it did, \\\\\"but with one important modification.\\\\\" In the original, there are two swastikas on Hitler\\'s outfit. Lenta removed them, noting that it had done so \\\\\"so as not to violate the law of the Russian Federation.\\\\\" It had its reasons. In November 2014, the Duma amended the Administrative Code to ban \\\\\"propaganda and public display of Nazi attributes or symbols.\\\\\" Thus, it subjected to fines not only the propaganda of Nazism but the display of Nazi symbols for whatever other purpose someone might have. Then in April 2015, the Russian government agency Roskomnadzor which supervises the media announced that after a study by experts it had concluded that \\\\\"the public demonstration of the attributes and symbols\\\\\" was not by itself equivalent to propaganda and therefore wasn\\'t subject to sanctions. Then the Duma got involved in all this and replaced the word \\\\\"and\\\\\" with the word \\\\\"either\\\\\" thereby confusing the situation further and meaning, Solonin says, that like those who enter Dante\\'s anyone in Russia involved with such things must \\\\\"leave all hope behind\\\\\" because one can never know how anyone will interpret this legal confusion. As for himself, Solonin concludes, the introduction of the word \\\\\"either\\\\\" is \\\\\"a manifestation of pure uncompromised idiotism.\\\\\" But he says that one \\\\\"can\\'t exclude\\\\\" that some \\\\\"evil people\\\\\" will suggest that this is all part of a general plan to take away the rights of Russians rather than protect the rights the constitution says they have.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Kremlin Contributing to Russia\\'s Demographic Crisis in Three Ways\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 24 - Most analysts in Russia and the West argue that changes in the size of the prime child-bearing cohort of Russian women, long-standing secular trends to smaller family size in Russia as in other countries, and the impact of the economic crisis on family choices and mortality rates as the most important explanations for Russia\\'s demographic crisis. Those three factors are undoubtedly the most important, and they are vectors that the Russian government can do little about at least in the short run. But this week brings news reports that spotlight three other factors, often ignored, where the Kremlin bears direct responsibility and that are making Russia\\'s demographic problems even worse. First, Russia is in the midst of a dramatic increase in HIV inflections and AIDS-related deaths, the result of ever earlier and most often unprotected sexual contacts and drug use and of the government\\'s failure to ensure that there are sufficient supplies of anti-retroviral drugs to ensure that those infected do not die of the disease. Russian medical experts say that HIV infections are up three to four percent in the last year alone, with some locations reporting even higher figures. And they are beginning to speak about HIV as \\\\\"an epidemic\\\\\" in Russia because the share of adults infected in many places is nearly two percent (versia.ru\\\\/yeksperty-yepidemiya-vich-v-rossii-prodolzhaet-rasprostranyatsya and iz.ru\\\\/635451\\\\/elina-khetagurova\\\\/infitcirovannykh-vich-stalo-bolshe-na-103). What makes this contributing factor to Russia\\'s demographic decline so appalling is that Western countries have shown that HIV\\\\/AIDS can be brought under control with consistent albeit expensive government programs of education and treatment. Moscow, however, under Vladimir Putin has cut back medical programs under the euphemistic name \\\\\"optimization.\\\\\" It may be optimization for the state budget, but it is not optimization for the Russian people and especially those suffering from this disease. Second, largely because of the Kremlin\\'s counter-sanctions program, there is a serious shortage of medications more generally. Moscow has blocked both the medicines themselves and the components out of which it has manufactured needed drugs and people are suffering. Russian diabetics, for example, often are not getting insulin. Without that drug, many will die. If the Kremlin was concerned about the health of its people rather than its geopolitical goals, it could import the needed drugs, many more people would survive, Russia\\'s third world-level adult male mortality rates would decline, and the country\\'s overall demographic numbers would improve. And third, Putin\\'s promotion of urbanization and his neglect of rural areas is having a demographic effect few have commented upon until this week. Given the increasing impoverishment of rural areas, young men are fleeing the villages to the cities and thus not becoming the fathers they otherwise might have been (vz.ru\\\\/society\\\\/2017\\\\/8\\\\/23\\\\/883902.html). In Russia as in other countries, birthrates in rural areas tend to be higher than in cities; but thanks to Putin\\'s megalopolis-focused policies, the young men who could make that possible are elsewhere. As a result, rural birthrates in Russia are lower than they would otherwise be; and consequently, Russia\\'s population is declining by more than it would if policies were otherwise.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Despite Levada Findings, Russians May be No Less Intolerant than They Were, Experts Say\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 25 - Many Moscow outlets are celebrating a Levada Center poll showing that Russians have become more tolerant to representatives of other nationalities, but Aleksandr Verkhhovsky of the SOVA Center suggests that this reflects less a real change of heart than the result of the impact of television messages. He points out that the government has directed its powerful television outlets send a clear message that xenophobic attitudes are wrong because \\\\\"they are destructive and give rise to conflicts,\\\\\" something the Kremlin wants to avoid. People have learned that expressing such attitudes is now unacceptable (kommersant.ru\\\\/doc\\\\/3391603). But Aleksandr Brod, head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights, is less upbeat. He says that everyday xenophobia continues but that \\\\\"aggressive anti-Western propaganda forms a feeling of antipathy to the West up to the sense that we are living in a besieged fortress. That intolerance spreads to others,\\\\\" including sexual minorities.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Plan to Delay Opening of Moscow Schools Near Major Mosque Outrages Some Residents\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 25 - This year, the Muslim holiday of Kurban Bayram occurs on September 1, the same day Russian schools are scheduled to open. Officials in the Russian capital have decided to postpone the opening of three schools near a mosque in the capital, a move that has outraged some Russians and prompted Muslim leaders to call for a compromise.a Moscow media are reporting that the city\\'s educational authorities have postponed the opening of three Russian schools near a mosque where thousands of Muslims will assemble for Kurban Bayram which this year occurs on September 1 for three days (znak.com\\\\/2017-08-24\\\\/v_neskolkih_shkolah_moskvy_lineyki_dnya_znaniy_perenesut_iz_za_kurban_bayrama). Although they have not said why, the authorities apparently have done so to avoid problems for parents and children who would have to navigate through the enormous crowds. But some parents are outraged because they object to the idea that the children in these schools won\\'t attend opening ceremonies until September 4 because of the Muslims. (The three-day delay reflects the fact that September 1 this year falls on a Friday, and because that is the normal day for Muslims to come to the mosque, officials have good reason to expect that Kurban Bayram celebrations at the six Moscow mosques will be even larger than is usually the case.) Fearful that this action will spark a backlash, Muslim leaders have proposed a compromise. Damir Gizatullin, first deputy head of the Muslim Spiritual Directorate (MSD) of Russia, has suggested that the school openings not be postponed for three days but perhaps for two to three hours (lenta.ru\\\\/news\\\\/2017\\\\/08\\\\/24\\\\/kurban\\\\/). He says that Muslims will be at the mosque only for about an hour beginning at seven in the morning and then will travel to the outskirts of the city because the animal sacrifices required for the holiday are not allowed within the city limits. (There are 16 sites in Moscow oblast where such ceremonies are permitted.) Consequently, Gizatullin says, the Muslims will have moved from the mosque by 8:30 at the latest and the schools could open. That is unlikely to satisfy some other Muscovites who view any such adjustment of all-Russian schedules to the Islamic community as unwarranted and wrong. This controversy is likely to intensify in the next few days; but however it ends, the fact that it is taking place at all highlights the growing size of the Muslim community in the Russian capital and the fact that the authorities have not allowed the construction of new mosques there has created conflicts by forcing Muslims to meet in only a few places.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Russians Don\\'t Understand Government Bans Don\\'t Make Them More Secure, Afanasyev Says\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 24 - Russians \\\\\"aren\\'t used to freedom; they are used to prohibitions,\\\\\" Sergey Afanasyev says; and they assume not only that there is little difference between more prohibitions and fewer but also that more prohibitions will make the state stronger and tthemselves more secure. That explains, the Moscow commentator says, why \\\\\"no one reacted to the prohibition of the Bible in the translation of the Jehovah\\'s Witnesses. Russians hate those who are able to use their freedom and realize their rights.\\\\\" And \\\\\"this is one of the reasons for their hatred of the Jehovah\\'s Witnesses\\\\\" (kasparov.ru\\\\/material.php?id=599D286072F5C). According to Afanasyev, \\\\\"the logic of an uncivilized country, the society of a society stuck in Asiatic medievalism is that the more prohibitions, the stronger the state.\\\\\" There is no recognition that such prohibitions leave society weaker and less secure and that they do nothing to stop the real threats to Russians like the Surgut terrorist presented. But as horrific as the popular acquiescence in the banning of the Bible in the Jehovah\\'s Witness translation, he continues, there is something even worse at work. The government media constantly talks about bringing to responsibility believers of this or that denomination, and the average Russia is so \\\\\"legally illiterate\\\\\" he doesn\\'t understand the differences between criminal and administrative rules. If someone violates administrative rules, he is assumed to be a criminal. As a result, Afanasyev says, a view of believers \\\\\"as criminals and violators of the law\\\\\" is being formed in Russian society; and that in turn is creating the grounds for making criminal what are now only administrative violations. Few Russians will notice the difference. And they will fail to see, he concludes, that their state with all its bans on religious activity is doing little or nothing to make them more secure in the face of terrorists or criminals.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: \\'What\\'s Happening with the Jewish Community in the North Caucasus?\\'\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 24 - Whenever something happens about which individuals and organizations that should know about it don\\'t for one reason or another, speculation often runs rampant. Such is the cased with the First Congress of the Jews of the North Caucasus that just completed its work in Grozny. Indeed, one commentator pointed to that reality by entitling his report about this meeting \\\\\"What is going on with the Jewish Community in the North Caucasus?\\\\\" because it is far from clear what this meeting really was about and what its consequences will be (kavkazr.com\\\\/a\\\\/chto-proizoshlo-s-evreyami-na-kavkazskoy-zemle\\\\/28692782.html). There are only a little more than 100 Jews now living in Chechnya, most of whom are Ashkenazim who returned to that republic after the wars. (The Mountain Jews who were more numerous there and elsewhere in the North Caucasus mostly emigrated to Israel in the last decades of Soviet times.) But neither of the two umbrella Jewish organizations, the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia (FEOR) or the Congress of Jewish Religious Organizations and Groups in Russia (KEROOP), had any knowledge about the meeting which was either organized by that community or by Ramzan Kadyrov ostensibly to unite all Jews in the North Caucasus. The meeting appears to have involved the Federation of Sephardic Jewish Communities of Russia, but the exact meaning of that is unclear because many in Russia routinely refer to all the Jews of the North Caucasus as Sephardim although it fact many or perhaps even most of the community there are not. If the congress leads to an effective umbrella organization for Jews in the North Caucasus, that would multiply the number of such groups in Russia and leave the Jews in a situation much like that of Russia\\'s Muslims who now have more than 80 Muslim Spiritual Directorates (MSDs) headed by independent muftis. Or alternatively, such a body cold give Chechnya\\'s Kadyrov yet another lever of power over the region and be used by him to project his influence beyond the borders of Chechnya. Indeed, it could give him yet another lever in Moscow as well. But perhaps the most interesting possibility was suggested by one of the organizers: Moysey Yunayev, a leader of the Jewish community in Chechnya, said that the congress was intended to unify not the Jews as a religious group but the Jewish \\\\\"ethnos,\\\\\" a Russian term for a large ethnic community. He said that the meeting was the first step toward \\\\\"the final consolidation of the Jewish ethnos on the territory of the North Caucasus\\\\\" by developing \\\\\"a common strategy to unify and improve the life of our people\\\\\" (nazaccent.ru\\\\/content\\\\/25127-v-chechne-namereny-obedinit-vse-evrejskie.html). The Moscow Jewish organizations have promoted the idea that the Jews are a religious group rather than \\\\\"an ethnos.\\\\\" For the Chechen Jews to push for an alternative view thus has the potential to spark controversy among the Jews of Russia as well as creating a new player in the complex ethnic chessboard that is the North Caucasus.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: A Real Fifth Column? Russians Who\\'ve Lived in China Prefer to Work for Chinese Firms on Returning Home\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 25 - Russians who\\'ve moved to China to live and work for extended periods say that should they return to Russia, they would prefer to work for Chinese firms rather than Russian ones or to teach Chinese language courses to other Russians, according to Beijing\\'s People\\'s Daily newspaper. A major reason, the paper continues, is that pay in Chinese firms is higher than in Russian ones, especially in Siberia and the Russian Far East from which many Russian expats in China come; and thus they give a Russian face to what are Chinese firms (russian.people.com.cn\\\\/n3\\\\/2017\\\\/0821\\\\/c31516-9258125.html). There are an estimated 40,000 Russian citizens now working in China; and many of those are ethnic Russian women who have married Chinese men. Among them, few are said to want to return to Russia even though visa and other conditions have become more difficult in recent years (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com\\\\/2016\\\\/08\\\\/despite-problems-most-russians-now.html).\\\\n\\\\nReport: Russian Offshore Wealth Likely Equal To Country\\'s Entire Household Wealth\\\\n\\\\nWASHINGTON -&nbsp;Capital flight from Russia is now likely equal to the collective wealth of all Russian households, according to a new report by a respected U.S. research firm, a trend that ha...\\\\n\\\\nThe Morning Vertical, August 25, 2017\\\\n\\\\nON MY MIND It has sent a chill through Russia\\'s artistic community.

The Moldovan leadership has proposed that the UN General Assembly discuss the withdrawal of Russia\\'s task force from the Moldovan territory, and the proposal does not apply to peacekeepers, the Moldovan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration said in a statement. \\\\\"Moldova\\'s initiative of adding an item of the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Moldovan territory to the agenda of the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly does not relate to Russian servicemen participating in the trilateral peacekeeping force stationed in the security zone of the Transdniestrian region,\\\\\" the ministry said. Media reports claiming that Chisinau has demanded Russian peacekeepers be withdrawn \\\\\"distort the essence of the Moldovan initiative and texts of the documents submitted to the UN secretary-general,\\\\\" it said. The Moldovan parliament adopted a declaration on the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Moldovan territory on July 21, 2017, and demanded that the government and the president promote the adoption of a relevant resolution of the UN General Assembly, which is why the appeal to the UN secretary-general had been made, the ministry said. \\\\\"The possible addition of the item proposed by Moldova to the agenda of the 72nd session will make possible a constructive discussion by the UN General Assembly of the unlawful deployment of the Russian task force in the country\\'s territory for the past 25 years in violation of the constitution, the permanent neutrality, sovereignty, and eternal principles of the international law,\\\\\" the ministry said.

The correspondent was especially offended that \\\\\"it is necessary to fill in the Ukrainian mov\\\\\", although Russians do not have the layout of the Ukrainian keyboard. The tasks of propagandists, as before, cause a negative attitude towards Ukraine, create a picture of pessimistic sentiments within Ukraine, convey gloom and doom on the background of the imaginary well-being of Russia.

Ukrainian audience knows him for his roles in TV series Stolen Happiness and Thunderstorm Gates. After the occupation of the Crimea, Pashinin in March 2014, recorded a video message to the Russians, in which he tried to explain what happened in Kyiv and convince them of the need to fight for their own freedom. For the last three years, the actor lived with his parents in Zaporizhia, Ukraine. As it was reported earlier another Russian actor Safonov was banned entry to Ukraine.

And it can be tempting -- or terrifying -- to think that such territorial questions could indeed be resolved by a deal, be it a cynical quid pro quo or a prudent compromise. Kadri Liik Kadri Liik is a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. However, viewing countries in the Eastern neighborhood -- namely, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine -- first and foremost as a geopolitical battleground obscures important layers of a more complex reality. The internal tensions in most of these Eastern European countries are not underpinned by geopolitical choices. This is not a struggle between the Eastern and Western worlds, even if some local politicians portray it as such. Rather, the tension is between self-interested elites and societies that are maturing and increasingly demanding accountability. But these ordinary internal tensions have become intertwined with geopolitics in ways that are unique to Europe and potentially very dangerous. This combination of factors presents Europe with policy dilemmas that cannot be resolved quickly -- either by reaching a deal or other means. But these challenges need to be diligently managed, so as to avoid dangerous escalations and to keep the door open for positive developments in the future. And while Europe does indeed need a new policy for the region, it cannot consist of easy fixes.\\\\n\\\\nThe roots of France\\'s problem with terrorism lie in a complex mixture of religion, social pressures, and alienation.

The American embassy suspended the issuance of visas to Russians until September 1. Now it will take place only in Moscow. This was the American response to the Russian demand for a half reduction in the staff of the US Embassy. A representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, remembered with relish discussing how many scouts are among American diplomats and that it would be nice to cut that number. I suspect that even after the Russian sanctions, their number will not decrease. But now the visa will be issued for three months. Although Sergey Lavrov said that the insidious Washington is trying in such a way to wake up the \\\\\"color revolution\\\\\", the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry knows very well that this is not so. Those who apply for American visas do not make revolutions. Rather, there will be a reduction in the number of those who will have the opportunity to see America with their own eyes, even in the interests of the Kremlin. From the subordinate population there will be enough descriptions of TV propagandists who, as a reward for their efforts, are allowed to own property in the territory of a potential adversary, and even enemy citizenship. Meanwhile, isolation from the outside world is a necessary prerequisite for a \\\\\"cold war\\\\\". Not only the population is doomed to receive dosed and prepared information. By entrusting the receipt of data on its main geopolitical rival to the so-called \\\\\"professionals\\\\\", the Russian leadership condemns itself to colossal failures. Such as the interference in the US presidential election turned out to be. The remarkable success of intelligence resulted in a colossal diplomatic catastrophe. Warnings about it could not knights raincoats and daggers, completely immersed in their operational activities. This should have been done by political scientists, historians who are constantly in the US and in contact with their American counterparts. Well, if they were asked for advice. And as a result of a series of sanctions and counter-sanctions, there will soon be no one to turn to. However, in the conditions of the new \\\\\"cold war\\\\\" the Kremlin does not feel the need to obtain information that does not coincide with its ideas. It is very revealing that Anatoly Antonov was appointed to the most important diplomatic post, Ambassador to the United States. Most observers refer him to supporters of the \\\\\"hard line\\\\\". Antonov five years was deputy defense minister. In this position, he briskly explained why foreign observers can not attend the maneuvers that covered the deployment of Russian troops to the Ukrainian border in February 2014. He brazenly asked rhetorical \\\\\"questions\\\\\" to Ukraine, trying to blame her for the death of the Malaysian \\\\\"Boeing\\\\\". For which he was included in the EU sanctions lists (apparently, this will create additional difficulties in the contacts of the ambassadors of European countries with the Russian representation in Washington). However, those who insist on Antonov\\'s \\\\\"hawkishness\\\\\" forget that it is Russia that owes him the greatest positive achievement of US-Russian relations of recent times - the conclusion of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). After receiving the command from Moscow, Antonov made unprecedented concessions to the Americans, agreeing to count the strategic bomber (which the Americans have much more than ours) as one warhead, while on each such aircraft a good dozen cruise missiles are deployed. And, accordingly, the warheads. That is, at a critical moment of Russian-American relations, a person sent to Washington who does not have his own opinion, a person who will only report what the boss wants. The Kremlin has deprived itself of the opportunity to receive unpleasant information.

He remembers instead a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy, who suffered from spastic quadriplegia that made her unable to stand or sit. Five years ago, she went to Yoon\\'s developmental-disability program at Pyongyang Medical University Hospital, where she received treatments from Yoon and his team of local doctors. After almost a year of exercise therapy and some surgeries, she walked out of the hospital on her own.\\\\n\\\\nThe event was heralded in North Korean state media as a national victory, but it received no notice in the U.S., where few people even know about the roughly 200 Americans like Yoon who work and live under the rule of Kim Jong Un. Carefully monitored by the regime, they have come and gone for years, doing educational, medical or infrastructural work, and sometimes raising families in a nation that has been officially at war with the U.S. since 1950. Yoon, 45, moved to North Korea 10 years ago. \\\\\"We were able to convince and convey to the North Korean government that the kids with disabilities have value and they can be part of society,\\\\\" says Yoon. \\\\\"I really believe in our presence.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHeidi Linton, a mother of three from Asheville, N.C., who leads the organization Christian Friends of Korea, has helped to deliver millions in aid to North Korea since 1995 and spends as much as three months a year in the country to support hepatitis and tuberculosis care centers. About 50 other Americans work in North Korea\\'s Rason Special Economic Zone, near the Russian border, on social entrepreneurship and humanitarian projects. There\\'s also a predominately American-run school, the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, that has brought nearly 70 American professors and staff members each semester.\\\\n\\\\nThe Americans in North Korea are controversial because they provide services that indirectly help the North Korean regime. But career diplomats say they create a thin but important connection to the Hermit Kingdom. \\\\\"They are very dedicated aid workers, they care deeply about the North Korean people,\\\\\" former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson says of the expatriate community. \\\\\"We have no diplomatic contact, we have no commercial contact, so some kind of humanitarian contact as a potential bridge to improve the relationship would be helpful.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBut that is set to change. Amid escalating military tensions and after the recent death of Otto Warmbier-the U.S. student who died after he was detained in North Korea-the Trump Administration announced in July that U.S. passports will become invalid for travel in, to or through the country starting on Sept. 1. The official reason for the travel ban is the \\\\\"mounting risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. citizens\\\\\" by the Kim regime, but the move could signal that Washington is preparing for relations to further deteriorate. North Korea continues to hold three U.S. citizens, including two former staff members of the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, in its political-detention system.\\\\n\\\\nThe news has prompted concern from the small community of Americans who have been working in the country, many of whom are evangelical Christians, a key part of Trump\\'s base. The very nature of their work is so sensitive and carefully negotiated that they are often reluctant to draw attention to their projects, though the new travel ban has prompted many to break that rule. They say they respect the State Department\\'s national-security concerns but that the cost of withdrawing aid is severe. \\\\\"The President has to make a strong stand,\\\\\" says Franklin Graham, whose global aid organization has done work in North Korea for 20 years. But, he adds, \\\\\"we\\'ve got to continue to try to work.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMany of the Americans who call North Korea home are pushing the Trump Administration for new permission to return. The State Department may allow limited exceptions, but the scope is not yet clear. \\\\\"It\\'s an abhorrent moral algebra that has overtaken us, that if moral evil is visited on great numbers, then the plight of individuals-and thus [the] work to relieve the suffering of individuals-somehow doesn\\'t matter,\\\\\" says Robert Carlin, a former U.S. official and behind-the-scenes diplomat during the Clinton, Bush and Obama years. \\\\\"Have we lost our moral compass?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe U.S.-North Korea relationship has long wavered between delicate and dangerous. Although the Korean War ended in 1953, leaving more than 1 million North Koreans and 36,000 Americans dead, a peace treaty was never signed, and enmity remains. Attempts to restart relations in the decades since have been short-lived, poisoned by distrust. Time and again, nuclear-nonproliferation negotiations have fallen apart or deals have been broken, with tensions spiking, though they have recently receded since North Korea stopped testing missiles in mid-August. As recently as early August, North Korean state media threatened torching the mainland U.S. with \\\\\"an unimaginable sea of fire.\\\\\" President Trump, meanwhile, counterthreatened with \\\\\"fire and fury like the world has never seen.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe quiet U.S. humanitarian effort in North Korea began as a response to a famine there in the mid-1990s, which killed hundreds of thousands of people. Groups like UNICEF, Mercy Corps and World Vision delivered food aid. When the world\\'s focus shifted away, Christian charities stuck around and deepened their ties. The Eugene Bell Foundation, which was founded by a Southern Presbyterian minister, began supporting tuberculosis treatment efforts in North Korea around that time, starting the first program for multidrug-resistant TB. \\\\\"These efforts are really outliers, in part because they are completely going against the grain of the body language that both governments are sending to their people,\\\\\" says Scott Snyder, a senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\\\\n\\\\nThe new relationships were fragile at the start. A century ago, Christianity thrived in the region, and American evangelist Billy Graham\\'s late wife Ruth even attended school in Pyongyang. Today North Korea\\'s constitution allows for freedom of religion, but the country forbids proselytizing. Such subtle distinctions may be lost on an outside world preoccupied with North Korea\\'s outlaw status: in 2014, the U.N. condemned its leaders for alleged crimes against humanity, including persecution for political crimes with torture, starvation and forced labor. But the U.S. groups are careful to respect the rules, and their focus is service projects.\\\\n\\\\nChristian Friends of Korea grew out of Graham\\'s visit to North Korea in the early 1990s. Linton, the group\\'s executive director, traveled to North Korea in August for a routine visit with a team of eight other Americans, three Norwegians and an Australian, all volunteers, to install clean-water systems and continue their hepatitis B treatment program. Linton often visits the two Protestant churches and the one Catholic-heritage church in Pyongyang, but she does not proselytize or preach. Her team of volunteers works alongside Korean officials during every trip. Medical treatment decisions are jointly made, and Americans and Koreans install water-distribution lines together.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, Franklin Graham-Billy and Ruth\\'s eldest son and the president of the aid organization Samaritan\\'s Purse-has sent 30 teams to North Korea over the past 20 years. One team was there in July at the request of the Korea-America Private Exchange Society, an official North Korean organization. It delivered five ambulances, purchased by Samaritan\\'s Purse, to pediatric hospitals. Both governments allow the presence of humanitarian workers \\\\\"to the extent that it serves their own purposes,\\\\\" says ambassador Robert King, the special envoy for North Korean human-rights issues during both of President Obama\\'s terms. \\\\\"For the United States, there is a benefit politically. It sort of softens the image of the United States, it provides information about the outside world to North Korea, which is an extremely isolated place.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps the most prominent operation in North Korea run by Americans is a university for 600 students started by evangelical Christians. James Kim, an American who immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea, had been involved in food-aid efforts to the country, which briefly got him arrested by authorities in 1998 on spying charges. He dreamed of starting a university that would teach free-market economy and entrepreneurship classes, expose students to Western thought and generate a peace-building movement.\\\\n\\\\nAfter building a similar school in Yanji, China, in the early 1990s, he worked with North Korean authorities to start a sister school in Pyongyang. It opened in 2010 and was largely funded by evangelicals in the U.S. and South Korea. The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology attracts staff members from the U.S., Europe and other parts of the world, and teaches all classes, including soccer, in English. Graduate students can study abroad in Europe. Many students come from North Korea\\'s elite families or are chosen by the North Korean Education Ministry. All students live on a closed compound outside the city. The curriculum, says the school\\'s U.S. director, Norma Nichols, \\\\\"is designed to open their eyes to other thoughts and to the world.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFaculty members know their limits. They follow strict rules prohibiting the discussion of politics or religion, and their courses, like international finance management, avoid topics like sociology or culture. The same day the travel ban was posted, on Aug. 2, the school\\'s North Korean co-president wrote a letter welcoming all foreign professors, their families and administration staffers, and assured the safety of their stay. \\\\\"We follow the rules,\\\\\" Nichols says. \\\\\"We are not going to be detained.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBut recent history suggests the work has risks. North Korea has detained at least 17 Americans in the past decade, and two staffers from the school are among the three U.S. citizens reportedly still held by the North Korean government. Authorities charged each with \\\\\"hostile acts,\\\\\" but the reason for their detention remains a mystery-one taught a monthlong accounting course, the other did agricultural development. Neither was a regular employee, school officials say, and they were not arrested on campus but when they were leaving the country.\\\\n\\\\nIn other areas, the ruling regime has used detention as a point of international leverage. In March, North Korea blocked Malaysian citizens, including diplomats and their families, from exiting the country after Kim Jong Nam, Kim Jong Un\\'s half brother, was allegedly assassinated in Kuala Lumpur\\'s airport. They were released when Malaysian officials eventually agreed to return his body and allow several North Koreans, including suspects in the assassination, to leave Malaysia.\\\\n\\\\nSuch behavior has led some in Congress to urge a much more aggressive posture against North Korea. \\\\\"Tragically, after the horrific treatment of Otto Warmbier and the regime\\'s demonstrated willingness to use American citizens as negotiating chips, limiting U.S. citizen travel, and ensuring that such travel is reviewed and approved ahead of time, is both sensible and necessary,\\\\\" Democratic Representative Adam Schiff of California says. Along with Republican Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina, Schiff introduced legislation in May to stop Americans from traveling to North Korea for five years. Like the State Department ban, which currently runs only one year, there is a narrow carve-out for humanitarian work. A floor vote is expected this year. \\\\\"It\\'s a great example of Congress and the White House working in tandem, backing each other up,\\\\\" Wilson says.\\\\n\\\\nDetention can cost the U.S. government millions of dollars in terms of high-profile diplomatic negotiations and consular efforts, says Snyder of the Council on Foreign Relations, and can prevent progress on critical negotiations. Tourists and religious advocates have generally posed a greater problem than humanitarian workers, who by and large understand the terms of engagement and follow the rules. \\\\\"I suspect the Trump Administration will tighten those humanitarian contacts, and I don\\'t think it is very wise,\\\\\" former ambassador Richardson says.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the Sept. 1 ban was announced, a representative from the U.S. consulate in Shenyang, China, held a town hall in Yanji, China, near the North Korean border, for U.S. citizens who live in that region. But the meeting provided few details of next steps, which have still not been announced by the Trump Administration. \\\\\"The safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas is one of our highest priorities,\\\\\" says Ashley Garrigus, a spokeswoman for the State Department\\'s Bureau of Consular Affairs. \\\\\"The travel warning for North Korea is for all U.S. national travelers, regardless of their reason for travel.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe consequences of violating the ban also remain unclear. The State Department could revoke a violator\\'s passport, or seek to prosecute those who violate the ban-misuse of a passport is a felony that could result in a long prison sentence. (A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on the potential consequences.) It is also unclear if dual citizens will face repercussions for traveling to North Korea on a non-U.S. passport.\\\\n\\\\nEven if some Americans get exceptions to travel, increased sanctions on North Korea have complicated their work. Yoon says he has been waiting eight months for a license from the U.S. Treasury so he can continue plans for a five-story, $3 million pediatric rehabilitation department at Pyongyang Medical University. It would be the first for the campus, capable of treating up to 200 outpatients and 40 inpatients every day, and funded largely by U.S. and South Korean donations. Christian Friends of Korea has struggled to get the right supplies it needs to make medical cultures and test drug sensitivity. When Linton recently wired money to purchase bicycles for rural medical personnel, the bank froze the funds, and she has spent weeks trying to get them back. \\\\\"Banks are so afraid of being brought up on violations that they are so inside of the legal red line,\\\\\" she says. \\\\\"They don\\'t want their legal department to be tied up dealing with a small humanitarian organization.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAt the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, classes are set to begin on Sept. 4 with the remaining non-American faculty. American school administrators plan to leave the compound in late August, after making sure that textbooks, finances and food supplies are in place for the coming semester. But if the Americans are not allowed back in, Nichols fears the school could become a North Korean project. \\\\\"The chain for all Western influence would be broken at that point,\\\\\" she says.\\\\n\\\\nYoon, meanwhile, has been taking his case to Foggy Bottom. \\\\\"We do not want to see one tragedy turn into a multitude of tragedies,\\\\\" he wrote in letter to the State Department, using the acronym for the Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea. \\\\\"Humanitarian work in the DPRK requires substantial time and effort in building relationships, negotiating work terms and monitoring the implementation of projects. This requires frequent, if not constant, presence in the DPRK.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAfter both growing up in South Korea, Yoon and his American wife Joy met when each moved to Illinois to study biology at Olivet Nazarene University. Yoon became a naturalized U.S. citizen, and when they learned that Christian organizations did work in North Korea, they decided to move there in 2007. He co-founded Ignis Community to support families in North Korea, and his team on the ground now includes 20 Americans, both staff and families. Yoon received special permission from the country\\'s then leader Kim Jong Il to earn an M.D. and Ph.D. from Pyongyang Medical University, and then permission from Kim Jong Un to develop a spine-rehabilitation program with the Ministry of Public Health. \\\\\"It took long-term engagement to get permission from DPRK to start our medical programs,\\\\\" Yoon says. \\\\\"We have that support, but now our U.S. policy is making us not able to continue to bring life and hope to these children.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFor now, Yoon and his family have decided to keep their apartment at the Polish embassy in North Korea at a reduced rent, but they will wait in their home in China. Even if Yoon gets special permission to return to North Korea to train 28 doctors this fall, he has heard that his family may not be able to join him. \\\\\"Our cerebral palsy and autism children become a second victim of the political tension,\\\\\" Yoon says. \\\\\"I\\'m hopeful and praying it will happen, but I am not sure with this great tension that the U.S. and DPRK has. They are talking about war.\\\\\"\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.yahoo.com\\\\/news\\\\/200-americans-living-north-korea-104110913.html\"},\"37\":{\"source\":\"Sputnik\",\"text\":\"The weeks of tension that followed Botswana\\'s approval of a visit from the Dalai Lama, despite Chinese objections, came to an unexpected end last Friday.\\\\n\\\\nOn August 11, four days before the trip was scheduled to begin, the Dalai Lama\\'s official website said the Tibetan political exile had to cancel his trip due to health reasons.\\\\n\\\\nThe sudden cancellation sparked an avalanche of speculation, with some guessing that Chinese government pressure had been the actual cause of the cancellation.\\\\n\\\\nBelieving that Tibetan issues are a matter of internal Chinese affairs, China has long taken a tough stance toward countries that invite the Dalai Lama or approve his visits.\\\\n\\\\nExperts say no matter what the real reason for the sudden change of plans, as time goes on it will be increasingly difficult for the Dalai Lama to travel internationally as his political influence is on the wane.\\\\n\\\\nThe Dalai Lama had been expected to visit Botswana\\'s capital Gaborone from August 15 to 20 to address a human rights conference and meet the country\\'s president despite China\\'s objections, Reuters reported.\\\\n\\\\nThe trip would have been his first visit to Africa, after he was repeatedly denied a visa to South Africa in the past.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, on August 11, the Dalai Lama\\'s official website posted a notice, saying he had cancelled his trip due to health reasons. \\\\\"[H]is 82-year-old body was telling him to rest,\\\\\" the notice read.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a9 Sputnik\\\\/ Ilya PitalevRussia\\'s Nornickel Sues Botswana\\'s BCL Group Over Nkomati Joint Venture Deal\\\\n\\\\nThe notice also said that the Dalai Lama found that carrying out his activities has left him unusually tired, and his physicians have \\\\\"also advised him to avoid undertaking long journeys for the next few weeks.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHowever, he is still scheduled to visit Europe from September 10 to 25 to attend a series of events including public talks and conferences, according to the website, and there has been no indication that these events will be cancelled or postponed due to his \\\\\"exhaustion.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMany have speculated that China\\'s objections and warnings toward Botswana were the deciding factor.

In 2008, after then French President Nicholas Sarkozy met the Dalai Lama in Poland, China cancelled the 11th annual China-EU summit, resulting in losses to EU trade. In 2011, South Africa refused to give the Dalai Lama a visa, likely due to the fact that China is Africa\\'s biggest trading partner. Countries including Germany and Norway have all shunned the Dalai Lama in recent years.\\\\n\\\\nA 2013 research paper by Andreas Fuchs of Heidelberg University\\'s Alfred-Weber-Institute for Economics which looked at global trade statistics from 2002 to 2008, found that a meeting between a head of state and the Dalai Lama lead to a reduction of exports to China by 16.9 percent on average; the Dalai Lama meeting with a government member decreased exports to China by 12.5 percent on average.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The more powerful China is, the smaller the space for the Dalai Lama is in the international community.

All photos courtesy of the author\\\\n\\\\nThe tour bus had far more passengers than seats, but no one around me seemed to mind. Most of the pilgrims were dancing anyway. A boy played drums; a middle-aged woman shook a yellow tambourine. In a joyous frenzy, children, teenagers and adults danced tirelessly in the aisle as the vehicle bounced along one of the few roads of the northeastern tourist trail that has not been reconstructed. Only the eldest were seated, infants in their laps, clapping to the calypso music blasting from the speakers, and passing around a flask of Ceylon tea. Everyone sang along.\\\\n\\\\nAll dressed in white, the Sinhalese tour group I was hitching a ride with had just finished sightseeing for the day at an ancient Buddhist temple on an island just off Sri Lanka\\'s northern tip that the Tamil separatist insurgency had previously made inaccessible. Earlier in the trip, they had visited Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) landmarks to learn more about the enemy that was defeated only four and a half years ago: a \\\\\"terrorist swimming pool,\\\\\" a Sea Tiger submarine construction yard, an LTTE military prison, and numerous monuments hailing the government army \\\\\"heroes\\\\\" who had \\\\\"liberated Sri Lanka from terrorism.\\\\\" Now, the pilgrims had reason to be festive; the 26-year long civil war was over and they could explore their country freely.\\\\n\\\\nWhile palm-fringed beaches, exotic wildlife, and historical Buddhist sites have made Sri Lanka into one of the world\\'s top tourist destinations - indeed, it was Lonely Planet\\'s top choice in 2013 - foreign visitors see little of the country\\'s troubled past. It is a war that the island\\'s holiday industry wants to remember and forget simultaneously. Since the conflict ended, Sri Lankans themselves have established a macabre domestic tourist trail in silence.\\\\n\\\\nDriven by a morbid curiosity, the island\\'s majority population - the Sinhalese - is returning to the northeastern battlefields by the busload. Many remnants of the Tamil Tiger rebels have been deleted from history, but the abandoned bunker home of their reclusive leader Velupillai Prabhakaran had been transformed into one of the key destinations, complete with a shooting range, an underground garage, and empty cages of guard dogs. By its entrance, families posed for portraits under a large \\\\\"Welcome\\\\\" sign. Inside, it was a damp, pitch-black maze.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I can\\'t see a thing!\\\\\" an old lady yelled, gripping her nephew\\'s arm tightly as she came to a panicked standstill on the crowded staircase, three floors below ground. \\\\\"Take me out of here! Now.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHer middle-aged nephew had patiently guided her through the foul darkness using his phone as a torch but now he couldn\\'t find the way out. A native of Colombo, the frail 75-year-old had not visited the northeast of her country since 1974, and now - armed with a small Japanese car and a meticulous itinerary of must-see \\\\\"terrorist\\\\\" landmarks, museums and Buddhist monuments - she was fiercely determined to catch up. Eventually, a smiling young soldier-tour guide came to their rescue and showed them to the sunny, although not fully clear of landmines, jungle outside. For days, she marveled at how the Tiger leader could live like that; it seemed so far from the luxury she had imagined.\\\\n\\\\nThe old lady didn\\'t understand the hype.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Why are we coming to see this?\\\\\" she complained. \\\\\"This is a man who destroyed so many lives. Why should we go see a bunker of a man who has done so much evil?\\\\\" The 30-year long civil war was still clear in her memories. The lingering fear of suicide bombers, even in the capital where she lived. The bombs would go off at random, and you never knew when leaving house in the morning if you would get home safe in the night.\\\\n\\\\nShe was largely alone in her skepticism. With a constant flow of tour buses, there seemed little doubt this was one of the most popular sights for Sinhalese tourists.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The fascination with Prabakharan started on the Tamil side with the cult of personality he created, and then it transferred over,\\\\\" explains Fred Carver, director of Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice, who thinks the fascination with the long-term adversary is understandable, and comparable to that of the Israelis in the Palestinians.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"What we need to understand is how very, very \\'other\\' the north seemed to Sinhalese people who were totally cut off from it for 30 years. So I think there was a desire to see what it was they had been missing all this time.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNow that the roadblocks are gone, an eclectic and often bizarre collection of memorials has mushroomed up across the previous war zone. Many are inside army camps - some recycled from the LTTE themselves, others built from scratch. Rather than demilitarising after the war, government troops were given an active role in the new holiday industry. Aside from monuments and innumerable \\\\\"army welfare\\\\\" shops, the military organises safaris and whale-watching tours, and for those who can afford it, it offers luxury hotels and private beaches.\\\\n\\\\nIn the process, critics say, the military regime has not only effectively colonialised the land, but monopolised the war narrative as well.\\\\n\\\\nEven before the war ended, the authoritarian Rajapaksa leadership zealously insisted on writing their version of history. In advance of the final surge against the Tigers, international monitors and press were evacuated from the war zone. Even today, the regime, with one of the world\\'s lowest press freedom ratings, controls the media aggressively, with journalists routinely intimidated, some even made to disappear. The government has also steadfastly resisted international calls for an independent investigation into war crimes allegedly committed by both sides during the war, but was rebuked when the United Nations Human Rights Council voted in March (shortly after a scathing report - the first definitive documentation of the various violations - was issued by watchdogs) to conduct one anyway. Perhaps anticipating the added scrutiny, the regime announced last fall it would conduct another census of dead and injured, but so far its own estimates of \\\\\"collateral damage\\\\\" don\\'t come near the UN figure of 40,000 civilians killed in shelling during the war\\'s final months.\\\\n\\\\nMost of them died just off the flourishing northern tourist trail. At the Vadduvakkalu causeway that connected the \\\\\"No Fire Zone\\\\\" with the rest of the Vanni, a small viewpoint pagoda overlooked the lagoon. Four years ago the water was red, witnesses said, from the blood of fleeing civilians caught in the cross fire between the LTTE and the government. Now, white pelicans and egrets waded in the shallow water beyond a large sign praising \\\\\"the brave soldiers of the great army\\\\\" for \\\\\"dislodging the terrorists from the shoulders of this lagoon bank without harming the innocent civilians.\\\\\" Nearby, perhaps the most triumphalist monument of all was erected: a lavish all-teak guest lodge - Lagoon\\'s Edge - on the site that the Tiger leader eventually died in May 2009. Inside its lobby, there was a framed portrait of the army division that allegedly executed him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"If the effort is to create a memorial to those that suffered, with a promise never again to allow such suffering, it might serve as a healing,\\\\\" says Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director of Human Rights Watch. \\\\\"But if the effort is at triumphalism, to celebrate the defeat of the LTTE without even an acknowledgement of the historical wrongs by all parties and ethnic groups, then it will be an exercise in humiliating the country\\'s ethnic minority and cannot serve as a step towards reconciliation.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIn Kilinochchi, the de facto Tiger capital, a water tower has been left where it fell when the rebels allegedly blew it up as they fled, marked by a sign, \\\\\"Never Again - Say No to Destruction,\\\\\" and a military-staffed shop named Souvenir Galore selling T-shirts, sweets, and colorful wigs. At the former Tiger stronghold of Thoppigala, where one of the final battles was fought, stood a military conservation project featuring an obstacle course and a stone monument that \\\\\"beacons the power, strength and warmth of [Sri Lanka\\'s] message of peace to the nations across the world and beyond,\\\\\" while \\\\\"resonating the joy of establishing order out of chaos.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nCapitalising on fascination for a country\\'s war-ridden past is nothing unique. Cambodia\\'s \\\\\"killing fields,\\\\\" America\\'s civil rights landmarks, and Europe\\'s many Holocaust memorials are all major tourist attractions. A possible distinction might be that these sights allow survivors to tell their stories, and often benefit them or their families financially. But the Sri Lankan commemoration is different: It centres on the military and does not even engage with the civilian losses suffered by Sinhalese, let alone by Tamils.\\\\n\\\\nHere, history lessons don\\'t seem to serve the purpose of reconciliation, nor ethnic integration. Rather than \\\\\"dark tourism,\\\\\" it appears more like a propaganda tour and victor\\'s justice at its most bizarre.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"They come here and spend an hour but they don\\'t see much,\\\\\" said one female resident, whose home is just off the path, about the Sinhalese tours. \\\\\"None of them actually stay.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFew, if any, Tamil locals have been employed in this flourishing tourism sector. It is a Tamil-majority area, yet virtually all signs are in Sinhalese, or occasionally English. For decades, Sri Lanka\\'s northeast had in effect been run as a separate state by the LTTE, with hospitals, schools, television channels, banks, and humanitarian aid administration. Into the vacuum, Sinhalese business and security forces have seeped in, in what some observers have labelled state-sanctioned colonialisation.\\\\n\\\\nBehind a gate shaped like battlements, another busload of Sinhalese tourists were given a tour of the LTTE museum\\'s loose collection of rusty weapons (homemade and imported), cannons, and one-person \\\\\"suicide boats.\\\\\" \\\\\"Grenade laugher\\\\\" stated one hand painted sign; \\\\\"LTTE motar weapon,\\\\\" another. Only a corrugated iron fence separated the museum from a fully functional military base. In a swamp next to the museum, a gigantic golden statue of a screaming soldier, with an AK-47 in one hand and the Sri Lankan flag in the other while looking to the site where Prabhakaran\\'s body was found, stood on a platform surrounded by white marble lions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"So, this is what the Tigers used to kill the Sinhalese people,\\\\\" an older man said sternly, pointing at a characteristically striped Sea Tiger ship. As one bus left, another group, from Jaffna University, arrived. Outside, next to an army stand selling pineapple cordial, a double amputee sold grapes from a UNHCR tarp covered shack.\\\\n\\\\nFurther along the trail, visitors gathered around the abyss that is the \\\\\"terrorist swimming pool,\\\\\" which the LTTE kept hidden from air inspections with an enormous camouflage net. The pool was empty now, except for some dirty water and leaves, and the diving boards were closed off with barbed wire.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"While the nation was swarming with pools of blood with the spate of LTTE\\'s heinous crimes elsewhere, the terrorist had constructed this huge swimming pool in 2001 for exclusive use of the cream of terrorists,\\\\\" reads a sign, adding that it measured 83 feet in length and 22 feet in depth, and had been used to train the Sea Tigers\\' professional divers for deployment in deep sea operations and suicide attacks.\\\\n\\\\nUnder military oversight, children played on two colourful playgrounds. By the entrance, at Caf\\\\u00e9 Sixty-Eight, decorated with a man-sized plastic pink ice cream cone, uniformed soldiers served soft drinks to the accompaniment of cheery calypso tunes. Red warning signs for land mines surrounded the parking lot.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I think the government is keen to show off the war trophies, the LTTE equipment, and infrastructure to Sinhalese tourists going north to show off what a great and heroic job they did, and what a terrible and brutal, and even strong group LTTE was,\\\\\" Ruki Fernando, a local human rights activist with Rights Now Collective for Democracy, told me in an interview before he was detained on terrorism charges. He has subsequently been released but is banned from speaking to the media.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The stronger and more brutal they make the LTTE appear, the greater the government will appear,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nThe legitimacy of the nepotistic Rajapaksa regime may hinge on the Tigers\\' defeat. Initially saluted as an extraordinary counterterrorism act, with the army offering its expertise to American and Chinese forces, gradually the \\\\\"humanitarian operation\\\\\" metamorphosed into an indiscriminate massacre. If that victory is diluted, for instance by the criticism of the regime\\'s alleged human rights abuses, the authoritarian family cabinet may not be guaranteed lasting power.\\\\n\\\\nEven so, Fernando believes the vast majority is not questioning the government propaganda. And while exact statistics on visitors are not available, the eerie sites never seem empty thanks to a steady flow of tour buses, mainly from rural areas in the island\\'s southwest. Tamils visit the sites too, although in far lesser numbers, with tour groups including schoolchildren as well as members of the diaspora.\\\\n\\\\nThe northeast also showcases the regime\\'s generous development efforts. Along the newly refurbished six-lane A9 highway - once known as the \\\\\"highway of death\\\\\" - new Buddhist shrines have proliferated in what critics call a gradual \\\\\"Sinhalisation\\\\\" of the northeast. But while tourists marvel over the region\\'s rapid development, they don\\'t see the refugee camps and bombed out ruins just off the road. An estimated 80,216 iternally displaced persons (IDPs) have yet to be resettled according to UNHRC\\'s records, and on a recent fact-finding mission to the country, UN Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay remarked that \\\\\"physical reconstruction alone will not bring reconciliation, dignity, or lasting peace.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"This type of tourism aims to hide from rural Sinhalese the sufferings of Tamils in the North during the war and even now, it totally obstructs ethnic harmony and prospects for reconciliation,\\\\\" Fernando told me. \\\\\"It\\'s very hurting and insulting when Sinhalese have a good time, appreciating the very forces that have caused so much suffering and ignore and don\\'t bother to find out their [the Tamils\\'] side of the story.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nYet some fear that the victory that the regime is basking in may just be a temporary cessation of hostilities. In November, a report from the International Crisis Group warned that the north remained under de facto military occupation and that if the regime \\\\\"continues to close avenues of peaceful change, the risks of violent reaction will grow.\\\\\" Many Tamils in the Vanni expressed uncertainty that the peace would last.\\\\n\\\\nFor survivors, the propaganda tourism seems just another reminder that reconciliation remains a distant promise. Mere miles away, and excluded from the tourist trail, the white sand of yet another paradise beach was strewn with possessions from tens of thousands of civilian victims killed in the so called \\\\\"safe zone,\\\\\" where non-combatants and Tamil Tigers alike were allegedly shelled with little or no discrimination. School backpacks, children\\'s sandals, VHS tapes, frying pans, and torn saris were everywhere. According to local survivors, people still come to reclaim the cooking utensils they left behind; others come to search for loved ones they had buried in shallow pits in the sand. There were no monuments there, the only signs of life a politely suspicious plain-clothes intelligence officer. And a stray dog.\\\\n\\\\nFrom here, another popular attraction could be spotted further down the beach; the skeleton of a stranded Iranian ship - Farrah III - which had supposedly been used by the Sea Tigers.\\\\n\\\\nUntil the day before Navi Pillay\\'s visit, one of the fields was covered with hundreds of rusty war vehicles. Then, local residents say, the army removed them all overnight.\\\\n\\\\nRemembering the war seems reserved for those who won. In the Vanni, there are no memorials for civilian victims. On the contrary, a priest attempting to place crosses in his garden commemorating 25 victims and colleagues was allegedly \\\\\"taken away.\\\\\" According to local watchdogs, the families of fallen LTTE cadres (many of whom were forcefully conscripted, and some of whom were children) are not allowed to keep their photos. On Martyr\\'s Day on November 26, a traditional LTTE holiday to commemorate victims, the military reportedly (according to the same watchdogs) visited Tamil homes to warn of \\\\\"serious consequences\\\\\" if they lit lamps for their dead. In at least two churches, army members cut the bell ropes. Throughout the former war zone, counseling of survivors remains banned even as it is desperately needed; a man who offers therapy in secret described how parents faint at the mere mention of their dead children.\\\\n\\\\nSoon after the war, the LTTE\\'s own monuments were torn down and even its own cemetery was bulldozed beyond recognition. On the scorched earth there are no longer gravestones - just young saplings of a tree that in Sri Lankan superstition only grows in cemeteries. According to local monitors (Fernando\\'s watchdog group), military checkpoints and fences were built on the site in the past year. Even so, a local revealed with a slight smile, passengers still get off the bus at \\\\\"the Heroes\\' Place.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe regime - which stands accused of war crimes - seems to realise its history lessons are controversial. It closed off some of the sites due to \\\\\"safety concerns\\\\\" and \\\\\"superior orders.\\\\\" Only days after the old lady\\'s visit to Prabhakaran\\'s bunker, the army detonated a bomb inside the place and destroyed one of the country\\'s most popular tourism sites in what some say was a preventive move to keep it from becoming a shrine for LTTE sympathisers. Farrah III was closed last summer to be salvaged for scrap metal.\\\\n\\\\nAs foreigners began to explore the country\\'s north, restrictions and registration procedures were introduced at some sites - perhaps because memories of the war could prove detrimental to Sri Lanka\\'s foreign tourism, which has become a vital industry. In November, two Agence France-Presse (AFP) journalists were restricted from photographing one of the war-tourism sites by military men citing orders to restrict media. In a recent phone conversation with Sri Lanka\\'s US embassy, the spokesperson denied not only the government\\'s involvement with these sites, but also their very existence.\\\\n\\\\nEarlier this year, a former Tamil Tiger had made the pilgrimage too, for reasons of his own. Having fought for over a decade, he was overwhelmed with emotions when he visited - incognito - the annexed bunker home. All floors had had air conditioning, he explained proudly.\\\\n\\\\nFor him, the war was lost but the struggle not yet over, and he\\'s convinced the regime\\'s triumphalism may ultimately backfire.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"My leader is not dead,\\\\\" the ex-combatant added, dismissing the photo evidence presented by the government as fake. \\\\\"I can\\'t believe it. I think he has gone to a foreign country.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThen, after showing his drivers\\' license to the young checkpoint soldier guarding his former guerilla camp, now another triumphalist monument, he swore that if someone started up the violence again he would not hesitate to join.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"When I saw my leader\\'s house, I cried,\\\\\" the former fighter confessed. He had to go, though; it had been impossible to come even close while the enigmatic leader was alive. And besides, where else would he go to commemorate his lost struggle?\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.vice.com\\\\/sv\\\\/article\\\\/kwp39n\\\\/tour-buses-to-sri-lankas-battlefields\"},\"39\":{\"source\":\"TIME\",\"text\":\"When American doctor Stephen Yoon thinks of North Korea, he does not think of ballistic missile tests or the threat of nuclear war. He remembers instead a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy, who suffered from spastic quadriplegia that made her unable to stand or sit. Five years ago, she went to Yoon\\'s developmental-disability program at Pyongyang Medical University Hospital, where she received treatments from Yoon and his team of local doctors. After almost a year of exercise therapy and some surgeries, she walked out of the hospital on her own.\\\\n\\\\nThe event was heralded in North Korean state media as a national victory, but it received no notice in the U.S., where few people even know about the roughly 200 Americans like Yoon who work and live under the rule of Kim Jong Un. Carefully monitored by the regime, they have come and gone for years, doing educational, medical or infrastructural work, and sometimes raising families in a nation that has been officially at war with the U.S. since 1950. Yoon, 45, moved to North Korea 10 years ago. \\\\\"We were able to convince and convey to the North Korean government that the kids with disabilities have value and they can be part of society,\\\\\" says Yoon. \\\\\"I really believe in our presence.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHeidi Linton, a mother of three from Asheville, N.C., who leads the organization Christian Friends of Korea, has helped to deliver millions in aid to North Korea since 1995 and spends as much as three months a year in the country to support hepatitis and tuberculosis care centers. About 50 other Americans work in North Korea\\'s Rason Special Economic Zone, near the Russian border, on social entrepreneurship and humanitarian projects. There\\'s also a predominately American-run school, the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, that has brought nearly 70 American professors and staff members each semester.\\\\n\\\\nThe Americans in North Korea are controversial because they provide services that indirectly help the North Korean regime. But career diplomats say they create a thin but important connection to the Hermit Kingdom. \\\\\"They are very dedicated aid workers, they care deeply about the North Korean people,\\\\\" former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson says of the expatriate community. \\\\\"We have no diplomatic contact, we have no commercial contact, so some kind of humanitarian contact as a potential bridge to improve the relationship would be helpful.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBut that is set to change. Amid escalating military tensions and after the recent death of Otto Warmbier--the U.S. student who died after he was detained in North Korea--the Trump Administration announced in July that U.S. passports will become invalid for travel in, to or through the country starting on Sept. 1. The official reason for the travel ban is the \\\\\"mounting risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. citizens\\\\\" by the Kim regime, but the move could signal that Washington is preparing for relations to further deteriorate. North Korea continues to hold three U.S. citizens, including two former staff members of the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, in its political-detention system.\\\\n\\\\nThe news has prompted concern from the small community of Americans who have been working in the country, many of whom are evangelical Christians, a key part of Trump\\'s base. The very nature of their work is so sensitive and carefully negotiated that they are often reluctant to draw attention to their projects, though the new travel ban has prompted many to break that rule. They say they respect the State Department\\'s national-security concerns but that the cost of withdrawing aid is severe. \\\\\"The President has to make a strong stand,\\\\\" says Franklin Graham, whose global aid organization has done work in North Korea for 20 years. But, he adds, \\\\\"we\\'ve got to continue to try to work.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMany of the Americans who call North Korea home are pushing the Trump Administration for new permission to return. The State Department may allow limited exceptions, but the scope is not yet clear. \\\\\"It\\'s an abhorrent moral algebra that has overtaken us, that if moral evil is visited on great numbers, then the plight of individuals--and thus [the] work to relieve the suffering of individuals--somehow doesn\\'t matter,\\\\\" says Robert Carlin, a former U.S. official and behind-the-scenes diplomat during the Clinton, Bush and Obama years. \\\\\"Have we lost our moral compass?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe U.S.--North Korea relationship has long wavered between delicate and dangerous. Although the Korean War ended in 1953, leaving more than 1 million North Koreans and 36,000 Americans dead, a peace treaty was never signed, and enmity remains. Attempts to restart relations in the decades since have been short-lived, poisoned by distrust. Time and again, nuclear-nonproliferation negotiations have fallen apart or deals have been broken, with tensions spiking, though they have recently receded since North Korea stopped testing missiles in mid-August. As recently as early August, North Korean state media threatened torching the mainland U.S. with \\\\\"an unimaginable sea of fire.\\\\\" President Trump, meanwhile, counterthreatened with \\\\\"fire and fury like the world has never seen.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe quiet U.S. humanitarian effort in North Korea began as a response to a famine there in the mid-1990s, which killed hundreds of thousands of people. Groups like UNICEF, Mercy Corps and World Vision delivered food aid. When the world\\'s focus shifted away, Christian charities stuck around and deepened their ties. The Eugene Bell Foundation, which was founded by a Southern Presbyterian minister, began supporting tuberculosis treatment efforts in North Korea around that time, starting the first program for multidrug-resistant TB. \\\\\"These efforts are really outliers, in part because they are completely going against the grain of the body language that both governments are sending to their people,\\\\\" says Scott Snyder, a senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\\\\n\\\\nThe new relationships were fragile at the start. A century ago, Christianity thrived in the region, and American evangelist Billy Graham\\'s late wife Ruth even attended school in Pyongyang. Today North Korea\\'s constitution allows for freedom of religion, but the country forbids proselytizing. Such subtle distinctions may be lost on an outside world preoccupied with North Korea\\'s outlaw status: in 2014, the U.N. condemned its leaders for alleged crimes against humanity, including persecution for political crimes with torture, starvation and forced labor. But the U.S. groups are careful to respect the rules, and their focus is service projects.\\\\n\\\\nChristian Friends of Korea grew out of Graham\\'s visit to North Korea in the early 1990s. Linton, the group\\'s executive director, traveled to North Korea in August for a routine visit with a team of eight other Americans, three Norwegians and an Australian, all volunteers, to install clean-water systems and continue their hepatitis B treatment program. Linton often visits the two Protestant churches and the one Catholic-heritage church in Pyongyang, but she does not proselytize or preach. Her team of volunteers works alongside Korean officials during every trip. Medical treatment decisions are jointly made, and Americans and Koreans install water-distribution lines together.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, Franklin Graham--Billy and Ruth\\'s eldest son and the president of the aid organization Samaritan\\'s Purse--has sent 30 teams to North Korea over the past 20 years. One team was there in July at the request of the Korea-America Private Exchange Society, an official North Korean organization. It delivered five ambulances, purchased by Samaritan\\'s Purse, to pediatric hospitals. Both governments allow the presence of humanitarian workers \\\\\"to the extent that it serves their own purposes,\\\\\" says ambassador Robert King, the special envoy for North Korean human-rights issues during both of President Obama\\'s terms. \\\\\"For the United States, there is a benefit politically. It sort of softens the image of the United States, it provides information about the outside world to North Korea, which is an extremely isolated place.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps the most prominent operation in North Korea run by Americans is a university for 600 students started by evangelical Christians. James Kim, an American who immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea, had been involved in food-aid efforts to the country, which briefly got him arrested by authorities in 1998 on spying charges. He dreamed of starting a university that would teach free-market economy and entrepreneurship classes, expose students to Western thought and generate a peace-building movement.\\\\n\\\\nAfter building a similar school in Yanji, China, in the early 1990s, he worked with North Korean authorities to start a sister school in Pyongyang. It opened in 2010 and was largely funded by evangelicals in the U.S. and South Korea. The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology attracts staff members from the U.S., Europe and other parts of the world, and teaches all classes, including soccer, in English. Graduate students can study abroad in Europe. Many students come from North Korea\\'s elite families or are chosen by the North Korean Education Ministry. All students live on a closed compound outside the city. The curriculum, says the school\\'s U.S. director, Norma Nichols, \\\\\"is designed to open their eyes to other thoughts and to the world.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFaculty members know their limits. They follow strict rules prohibiting the discussion of politics or religion, and their courses, like international finance management, avoid topics like sociology or culture. The same day the travel ban was posted, on Aug. 2, the school\\'s North Korean co-president wrote a letter welcoming all foreign professors, their families and administration staffers, and assured the safety of their stay. \\\\\"We follow the rules,\\\\\" Nichols says. \\\\\"We are not going to be detained.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBut recent history suggests the work has risks. North Korea has detained at least 17 Americans in the past decade, and two staffers from the school are among the three U.S. citizens reportedly still held by the North Korean government. Authorities charged each with \\\\\"hostile acts,\\\\\" but the reason for their detention remains a mystery--one taught a monthlong accounting course, the other did agricultural development. Neither was a regular employee, school officials say, and they were not arrested on campus but when they were leaving the country.\\\\n\\\\nIn other areas, the ruling regime has used detention as a point of international leverage. In March, North Korea blocked Malaysian citizens, including diplomats and their families, from exiting the country after Kim Jong Nam, Kim Jong Un\\'s half brother, was allegedly assassinated in Kuala Lumpur\\'s airport. They were released when Malaysian officials eventually agreed to return his body and allow several North Koreans, including suspects in the assassination, to leave Malaysia.\\\\n\\\\nSuch behavior has led some in Congress to urge a much more aggressive posture against North Korea. \\\\\"Tragically, after the horrific treatment of Otto Warmbier and the regime\\'s demonstrated willingness to use American citizens as negotiating chips, limiting U.S. citizen travel, and ensuring that such travel is reviewed and approved ahead of time, is both sensible and necessary,\\\\\" Democratic Representative Adam Schiff of California says. Along with Republican Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina, Schiff introduced legislation in May to stop Americans from traveling to North Korea for five years. Like the State Department ban, which currently runs only one year, there is a narrow carve-out for humanitarian work. A floor vote is expected this year. \\\\\"It\\'s a great example of Congress and the White House working in tandem, backing each other up,\\\\\" Wilson says.\\\\n\\\\nDetention can cost the U.S. government millions of dollars in terms of high-profile diplomatic negotiations and consular efforts, says Snyder of the Council on Foreign Relations, and can prevent progress on critical negotiations. Tourists and religious advocates have generally posed a greater problem than humanitarian workers, who by and large understand the terms of engagement and follow the rules. \\\\\"I suspect the Trump Administration will tighten those humanitarian contacts, and I don\\'t think it is very wise,\\\\\" former ambassador Richardson says.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the Sept. 1 ban was announced, a representative from the U.S. consulate in Shenyang, China, held a town hall in Yanji, China, near the North Korean border, for U.S. citizens who live in that region. But the meeting provided few details of next steps, which have still not been announced by the Trump Administration. \\\\\"The safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas is one of our highest priorities,\\\\\" says Ashley Garrigus, a spokeswoman for the State Department\\'s Bureau of Consular Affairs. \\\\\"The travel warning for North Korea is for all U.S. national travelers, regardless of their reason for travel.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe consequences of violating the ban also remain unclear. The State Department could revoke a violator\\'s passport, or seek to prosecute those who violate the ban--misuse of a passport is a felony that could result in a long prison sentence. (A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on the potential consequences.) It is also unclear if dual citizens will face repercussions for traveling to North Korea on a non-U.S. passport.\\\\n\\\\nEven if some Americans get exceptions to travel, increased sanctions on North Korea have complicated their work. Yoon says he has been waiting eight months for a license from the U.S. Treasury so he can continue plans for a five-story, $3 million pediatric rehabilitation department at Pyongyang Medical University. It would be the first for the campus, capable of treating up to 200 outpatients and 40 inpatients every day, and funded largely by U.S. and South Korean donations. Christian Friends of Korea has struggled to get the right supplies it needs to make medical cultures and test drug sensitivity. When Linton recently wired money to purchase bicycles for rural medical personnel, the bank froze the funds, and she has spent weeks trying to get them back. \\\\\"Banks are so afraid of being brought up on violations that they are so inside of the legal red line,\\\\\" she says. \\\\\"They don\\'t want their legal department to be tied up dealing with a small humanitarian organization.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAt the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, classes are set to begin on Sept. 4 with the remaining non-American faculty. American school administrators plan to leave the compound in late August, after making sure that textbooks, finances and food supplies are in place for the coming semester. But if the Americans are not allowed back in, Nichols fears the school could become a North Korean project. \\\\\"The chain for all Western influence would be broken at that point,\\\\\" she says.\\\\n\\\\nYoon, meanwhile, has been taking his case to Foggy Bottom. \\\\\"We do not want to see one tragedy turn into a multitude of tragedies,\\\\\" he wrote in letter to the State Department, using the acronym for the Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea. \\\\\"Humanitarian work in the DPRK requires substantial time and effort in building relationships, negotiating work terms and monitoring the implementation of projects. This requires frequent, if not constant, presence in the DPRK.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAfter both growing up in South Korea, Yoon and his American wife Joy met when each moved to Illinois to study biology at Olivet Nazarene University. Yoon became a naturalized U.S. citizen, and when they learned that Christian organizations did work in North Korea, they decided to move there in 2007. He co-founded Ignis Community to support families in North Korea, and his team on the ground now includes 20 Americans, both staff and families. Yoon received special permission from the country\\'s then leader Kim Jong Il to earn an M.D. and Ph.D. from Pyongyang Medical University, and then permission from Kim Jong Un to develop a spine-rehabilitation program with the Ministry of Public Health. \\\\\"It took long-term engagement to get permission from DPRK to start our medical programs,\\\\\" Yoon says. \\\\\"We have that support, but now our U.S. policy is making us not able to continue to bring life and hope to these children.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFor now, Yoon and his family have decided to keep their apartment at the Polish embassy in North Korea at a reduced rent, but they will wait in their home in China. Even if Yoon gets special permission to return to North Korea to train 28 doctors this fall, he has heard that his family may not be able to join him. \\\\\"Our cerebral palsy and autism children become a second victim of the political tension,\\\\\" Yoon says. \\\\\"I\\'m hopeful and praying it will happen, but I am not sure with this great tension that the U.S. and DPRK has. They are talking about war.\\\\\"\",\"url\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/time.com\\\\/4913703\\\\/americans-living-north-korea-have-little-time-left\\\\/\"},\"40\":{\"source\":\"The Independent\",\"text\":\"Mirgayas Shirinsky is the sixth senior diplomat from his country to have died suddenly overseas since November\\\\n\\\\nRussia\\'s ambassador to Sudan was found dead in the swimming pool of his Khartoum residence, officials have said.\\\\n\\\\nHe is the sixth senior Russian diplomat to have died suddenly overseas since last year\\'s US election.\\\\n\\\\nThe Sudanese foreign minister released a statement confirming Mirgayas Shirinsky, who was in his early sixties, died at his Karthoum home but he did not give a cause of death.\\\\n\\\\nThe AFP quoted a police spokesman saying he was found in the swimming pool.\\\\n\\\\nHis death comes after a string of Russian diplomats have died suddenly overseas since November.\\\\n\\\\nOn the morning of the US election day, Russian diplomat Sergei Krivov, 63, was found lying unconscious on the floor of the Russian Consulate in New York with a head injury.

The journalist believes that Russia will take such a step when its citizens face actual impoverishment, Novoye Vremya reported. \\\\\"I think that Russia will still invade Ukraine, but not now. When it comes to the real impoverishment of the Russian people and the \\'oil-for-food\\' social programs, then the war will be definitely needed, and Ukraine is an obvious target,\\\\\" the journalist said. He also said that the Russian-Ukrainian war will end only when Ukraine regains all its territories. According to the journalist, Kyiv has both military and non-military resources for the return of the occupied territories of Donbas. \\\\\"... Russia is even ready to give them up. However, Ukraine does not have the resources to return Crimea. Russia will never give up the peninsula by its own will,\\\\\" Babchenko said. As UNIAN reported earlier, the Russian Federation will be forced to withdraw its forces from the now-occupied areas of Donbas, according to Ukrainian Deputy Minister for temporarily occupied territories and internally displaced persons Yuriy Hrymchak, who commented on the meeting of U.S. special representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker and Putin\\'s aide Vladislav Surkov. Hrymchak suggested that the decision to withdraw Russian troops from Donbas had already been taken. According to the official, the only thing being discussed now is how exactly the Russian troops will leave eastern Ukraine. At the same time, Deputy Minister for the Temporarily Occupied Territories and IDPs George Tuka doubted the idea that any concrete agreements had been reached at the meeting, so it is too early to talk about the withdrawal of Russian troops from Donbas.\\\\n\\\\nRussian bomber Tu-95 spotted above Baltic Sea, Denmark\\'s fighter jets escorted it - Russian bomber Tu-95 spotted above Baltic Sea, Denmark\\'s fighter jets escort it - 112.international\\\\n\\\\nDespite its large size, the Tu-95 bomber is the world\\'s fastest aircraft with screw engines\\\\n\\\\nUAWire - Bulgaria wants to abandon Russian MiG military aircraft\\\\n\\\\nIn response to a statement made by the Bulgarian Minister of Defense, Krasimir Karakachanov, that Bulgaria could abandon purchasing new fighters and repair old Russian MiGs that are used in the Bulgarian army, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev spoke against the repair of Russian MiG-29 fighters insisting on the acquisition of new aircraft that meet NATO standards. \\\\\"No, absolutely not, we cannot give up buying new fighters for the Bulgarian military.

Prominent Russian sociologist and dissident Igor Eidman, who resides in Germany, has started a Facebook group (featured below) to counter Kremlin propaganda in that country. And Eidman isn\\'t the only Russian living abroad who is representative of the Other Russian World. In Riga, Anton Lysenkov, a former journalist for Lenta.ru, has started a magazine called Spektr that is dedicated to countering the narratives on Russian state television and providing Latvia\\'s Russian speakers with quality reporting, analysis, and commentary in their language. Galina Timchenko and her team at the Riga-based Meduza news site are likewise performing a similar service. Former State Duma Deputy Ilya Ponomaryov, the only Russian lawmaker to vote against the annexation of Crimea, now resides in Kyiv, where he not only pushes back against Russian propaganda, but has also become a constructive voice on Ukrainian politics as well. The list can go on. As Russia\\'s best and brightest minds emigrate in increasing numbers, they are often making their new homes in the Baltics and Ukraine.

Galkina says this is clear if one looks beyond the discussions of moving the capital from Moscow and recognizes that Sergey Kiriyenko, the first deputy chief of the Presidential Administration, has not only stated that Moscow won\\'t extend the power-sharing agreement with Tatarstan but made a more fateful declaration (kasparov.ru\\\\/material.php?id=599BC8EC5C63E). The Kremlin official says that \\\\\"Russian statehood and the state are built not on the basis of agreement.\\\\\" Not only does that contradict Point Three of Paragraph 11 of the Russian Constitution which specifies exactly the reverse but also poses a challenge to regional leaders at precisely a time when Moscow should not be alienating them further. \\\\\"The economic losses of the regional elites of the Russian Federation as a result of the insane adventures of the Kremlin in foreign affairs could be compensated by decentralization,\\\\\" Galkina says. \\\\\"But the rejection of competitive gubernatorial \\'elections,\\' the strategic declaration of Kiriyenko, and much else\\\\\" shows the Kremlin is going in the opposite direction. According to Galkina, \\\\\"it appears that in the Kremlin they think that if they respond to the challenges of \\'the new 1980s\\' by tightening the screws, that is to proceed along a path opposed to that of Gorbachev, they will be able to avoid the fate of the USSR.\\\\\" They are simultaneously right and wrong. They are right that the situation they are setting up is unlikely to be resolved peacefully, but they are wrong to think that the center won\\'t be challenged and the country\\'s territorial integrity won\\'t be as well. After all, she says, \\\\\"the hatred of the regions for the center will be much stronger than it was in perestroika\\\\\" if Moscow continues in its current direction.

He draws that conclusion on the basis of the reaction of Russian commentators and politicians to a rap battle which took place last week between two Russians whose vocabulary and attitudes reflect the following four trends among young people and their elders who are chasing after them: \\\\u00b7 \\\\\"The universal denial of any rules and conditions, the lifting of every and all taboos, the rejection not only of past culture but of the challenges of culture as such, the cult of wildness and force;\\\\\" \\\\u00b7 \\\\\"The poetization of cruelty, the voluptuous relishing of evil, the mockery of victims, the passionate denigration of weakness\\';\\\\\" \\\\u00b7 \\\\\"The aggressive decades, the pursuit of form at the expense of content, and the exaltation of the symbolic;\\\\\" and \\\\u00b7 \\\\\"Moral relativism where there is neither good nor bad but rather cynicism raised to an absolute.\\\\\" \\\\\"All this,\\\\\" the historian continues, \\\\\"very much recalls the times of Russian futurism and constructivism with only this difference that futurism and constructivism were all the same to a remarkable degree original Russian formats while rap and other similar trends are deeply derivative.\\\\\" \\\\\"The so-called \\'battle\\'\\\\\" between two young rappers, Fedorov and Mashnov, was far less interesting than the reaction of Russian observers. Their reaction showed that the television is declining in importance to YouTube for Russian young people and that those born in the last 20 years have become the focus of elite attention. According to Pastukhov, \\\\\"the combination of subject and format is generating a chain reaction,\\\\\" one that clearly suggests that \\\\\"the fuel of all future revolutions and regime overthrows\\\\\" can rely on \\\\\"a renewable source of protest energy\\\\\" and that this will lead to the outbreak of \\\\\"a real war.\\\\\" Today, \\\\\"the slogan for Russia is what is good for the young is good for politicians,\\\\\" all of whom have suddenly begun to display a hitherto hidden love for rap music. \\\\\"Everyone from Putin to Navalny is ready to sing \\'pioneer songs,\\'\\\\\" but the words of the new songs are very different than those of Soviet times. The message of this new rap is that \\\\\"your culture is hateful to us, your laws are hateful to us ... and we in general hate all of you. Somewhere we have already heard all of this,\\\\\" in the years leading up not to 1991 but to 1917, Pastukhov says. \\\\\"A revolution matures over the course of decades ... but creative people have a surprising nose for revolution. They feel the shifting of the social foundations much earlier than the institutions begin to fall.\\\\\" And that is clearly what is happening in Moscow now. \\\\\"If one judges by the tendencies of the development of Russian culture and the tempos of its evolution into \\'an anti-culture,\\' then the end of Putin\\'s \\'beautiful era\\' will occur more according to the scenario of the beginning of the 20th century than according to the scenario of its end, however much one might prefer otherwise.\\\\\" And \\\\\"if \\'the battle\\' of Fedorov and Mashnov is really mainstream,\\\\\" Pastukhov continues, \\\\\"then I know how the future Russia will be called - \\'a Greater Donbass.\\'\\\\\" A revolution is inevitable, he says, but it will not be a \\\\\"velvet\\\\\" one but rather a bloody one carried out by \\\\\"the real Russian political hardcore.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: If Putin Were Arrested, Russians who Back Him Now would Disown Him Then, Portnikov Says\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 23 - The failure of Russians to see that what is being done to others may soon be done to them and to rise in protest means, Vitaly Portnikov says, that \\\\\"if tomorrow Putin were to be under arrest at his dacha, it would turn out that 90 percent of those who now back him would disown him.\\\\\" The Ukrainian commentator argues that the Russians and especially those often identified as their cultural leaders thus continue to fall victim to the self-justification for going along if they personally aren\\'t attacked that Pastor Martin Niemoeller described so classically in Nazi Germany(ru.krymr.com\\\\/a\\\\/28691992.html). That of course means that no Russian leader, including Putin, can count on unwavering support however much power he appears to have amassed and that no real solidarity can emerge among Russians to oppose the rise of ever more authoritarianism among leaders who simultaneously recognize that reality and fear it. Portnikov takes as his point of departure the reactions of Russian intellectuals to the arrest of Serebrennikov. Some support Putin\\'s decision to detain him; others don\\'t. But among the latter there are two groups: the small one whose members view it as part of a larger problem, and the far more numerous one consisting of those who don\\'t connect the dots. The latter fail to recognize that Putin\\'s war against Ukraine and his arrest of independent-minded directors are all of a piece, and they thus hope, as Pastor Niemoeller warned against, that the wave of arrests will somehow not reach them and that they can continue to get money for their activities from the regime. Those who act in this way, the Ukrainian commentator continues, do not reflect \\\\\"a culture of self-awareness and analysis of their own spirit and life situation.\\\\\" Indeed, one should not call them representatives of genuine culture at all. Thus, \\\\\"Tatyana Lioznova filmed \\'17 Instants of Spring\\' about the Soviet apparats but to the end of her life didn\\'t understand it. Mark Zakharov filmed \\'Kill the Dragon\\'\\\\\" but didn\\'t get it either. And the list goes on and on, an indictment of those who seek to claim the title of independent intellectuals. They do not appear to understand what they are about or at least are prepared to \\\\\"imitate\\\\\" culture\\\\\" much as \\\\\"Putin imitates political activity when his closest friends fill their pockets with billions.\\\\\" Ultimately, however, neither imitation will be persuasive because as Pastor Niemoeller implied, there will always be some who will see through it.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: The Problem isn\\'t Where the Russian Capital Is but Rather the Role It Plays, Commentators Say\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 22 - The latest call to move the Russian capital from Moscow to east of the Urals (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com\\\\/2017\\\\/08\\\\/krupnov-proposes-shifting-capital-to.html) has sparked discussion even though most say the idea isn\\'t new and won\\'t ever be realized (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com\\\\/2017\\\\/08\\\\/history-suggests-cheaper-ways-to-get.html). But the most important aspect of this discussion is not about a possible move to Irkutsk or Novosibirsk or someplace else but about the fateful role that a Russian capital wherever it might be inevitably plays for the country as a whole and in particular for the region in which it is situated. Siberian historian Yury Chernyshev notes that proposals to shift the Russian capital from Moscow to a city in Siberia have become a commonplace, something used for PR purposes or to distract attention from real problems. \\\\\"None of the current \\'elite\\' of course, will voluntarily move to Siberia,\\\\\" so these ideas are going nowhere (regnum.ru\\\\/news\\\\/polit\\\\/2312215.html). At the same time, there is a real problem that lies behind such talk, he continues: \\\\\"All Russia now is divided between Moscow and not-Moscow,\\\\\" the result of Kremlin actions that have made federalism meaningless and that have sucked the best and the brightest out of the regions to the center, while allowing them to give orders and demand reports from the subjects. As a result, Chernyshev says, there has been an even greater bureaucratization of the state apparatus than there was in the Soviet nomenklatura, and this in turn has frozen the development of the country and especially weakened its eastern regions where it is most difficult for people to survive.\\\\\" Vladislav Inozemtsev, a Moscow economist and commentator provides some additional discussion on what he calls \\\\\"the dangers of de-Muscovization,\\\\\" a process that he suggests ignores what the real problems of Russian administration now are and what needs to be done to correct them rather than just moving the capital city (snob.ru\\\\/selected\\\\/entry\\\\/128172). Everyone should recognize that \\\\\"the concentration of resources in the places most favorable for life is a natural worldwide tendency and [that] the chance for resettling millions of people in the tundra or the desert has disappeared since GULAG times,\\\\\" Inozemtsev continues. The question people should be asking is very different. How can Russia create conditions in which there are dozens of such cities which \\\\\"could become \\\\\"\\'anchors\\' for people who don\\'t want to live in villages\\\\\" and who would be quite content to live in a mid-sized city if it had all the features of modern life and a modicum of financial and political power. Such a situation, of course, could arise \\\\\"only under conditions of financial and political decentralization, the improvement of standards of living in the regions, and the weakening of the attractiveness not of Moscow as the capital but of the capital as such, wherever it might be located.\\\\\" That \\\\\"will not be decided by transferring capital functions or changing the headquarters of state corporations,\\\\\" he says. What is needed is that \\\\\"business, intellectual centers, and mass media arise in the provinces rather than being \\'imposed\\' there from the center. The most important condition for this is a rejection of vozhdizm, \\'the \\'tsarist\\' tradition of our rule.\\\\\" \\\\\"Moving the capital will not solve the problems of federalism.\\\\\" What has to happen is htat the regions need to receive \\\\\"or better\\\\\" demand the right to oppose Moscow, to elect governors and mayors without the center having any say, and to manage their finances with a far greater accent on regional priorities.\\\\\" In short, \\\\\"the basis of a real \\'de-Muscovization\\' must be a new Federative treaty, in which the capital would not be a subject - a good example is Washington, which fulfills the functions of a capital but does not have any representation in the Congress of the United States,\\\\\" Inozemtsev continues. \\\\\"If Russia were to become a genuine federation, one created from below rather than imposed from above,\\\\\" then all relations between the center and the periphery and the meaning of the center would change, and the issue of where the capital should be would become something of secondary interest. Inozemtsev explores a number of other reasons why simply moving the capital will do nothing to solve Russia\\'s problems. Among these is his observation that shifting the capital to Siberia \\\\\"would neutralized the reformist potential of Siberia by killing in the cardle any attempts at decolonization of the still existing empire.\\\\\" Moreover, such a shift would lead to a new emphasis on raw materials rather than high tech as the basis of the economy and make Russia more Asian and less European. People should remember that \\\\\"greater democracy or respect for law never has come to Russia from the East\\\\\" and wouldn\\'t this time around. Moscow for all its problems is like a large diamond, \\\\\"one of the main glories of Russia.\\\\\" Dividing it up or shifting its function to somewhere else would be like breaking it into pieces. Much would be lost and the resulting multiplicity would be worth far less than the single gem. The task, he says, is to create a setting for Moscow by building a federation from below.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Russians Urged to Reflect on \\'Inexplicable Paradoxes of the Soviet Union\\'\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 22 - A Moscow blogger has suggested that Russians now, when thinking about the Soviet past, should reflect on what he calls that country\\'s \\\\\"inexplicable paradoxes\\\\\" not only when thinking about their own relationship to it but also about where they are now (topru.org\\\\/59430\\\\/neobyasnimye-paradoksy-sovetskogo-soyuza\\\\/).

It crosses a line because it shows that Vladimir Putin\\'s regime is no longer just prosecuting opponents for things that are patently absurd and it is no longer fabricating criminal cases with any degree of plausibility. Now it is making stuff up out of whole cloth and denying reality altogether. Yesterday\\'s arrest of Kirill Serebrennikov sets a precedent. It sets a precedent because as soon as you do this once, it is easier to do it again, and again, and again. And yesterday\\'s arrest of Kirill Serebrennikov sends a message. It sends a message because by coming after one of Russia\\'s most renowned living film and theater directors in such a way, the Kremlin is saying that nobody who speaks out against the regime -- no matter how famous, prominent, or popular they may be -- is safe. According to media reports, Serebrennikov and three of his colleagues are charged with embezzling state funding to produce an adaption of William Shakespeare\\'s A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream. The play premiered in November 2012 and was a big hit. It has been staged multiple times in Moscow -- including at the Golden Mask Russian theater festival -- as well as in Paris. The performances have been photographed and filmed and dozens of reviews have been published in Russia and abroad. But despite all this, the authorities are insisting the play was never performed and that Serebrennikov and his colleagues simply pocketed the money. In an editorial this week, Meduza compared Serebrennikov\\'s case to that of Vsevolod Meyerhold, the director who was arrested and executed at the height of Josef Stalin\\'s Great Terror. We may not be back in the 1930s.

The current debate was opened by open letter to Karimov\\'s successor from Uzbek literary scholar Shukhrat Rizayev in Kitob dunesi arguing that Uzbekistan should return to Cyrillic lest it fall further behind the world because Uzbeks still have to rely mostly on Uzbek materials published in Cyrillic (kitobdunyosi.uz\\\\/publitsistika\\\\/460-prezidentimizga-maktub.html). That letter provoked a discussion of the issue in many Internet portals with some backing Rizayev\\'s ideas and others insisting that the current course of promoting a Latin script is the correct one. The FerganaNews portal asked Alisher Ilkhamov of SOAS to comment on the implications of alphabet reforms (fergananews.com\\\\/articles\\\\/9524). In fact, Ilkhamov points out, Rizayev didn\\'t call for returning everything in Uzbekistan to the Cyrillic script but only legalizing the situation in which now and for some decades ahead much of the popular and scientific literature in Uzbek will remain in Cyrillic and Uzbeks need to be able to use it, even if they also use the Latin script. The London-based Uzbek scholar also argues that a shift from one alphabet to another is more a political issue than a substantive one because the sound values of letters are set by convention. (He doesn\\'t discuss the earlier shift from Arabic to Latin script because then alphabet change mattered more as Arabic didn\\'t show vowels while the Latin did.) The push to shift from Cyrillic to Latin scripts in the Turkic republics followed a November 1991 meeting in Istanbul at which representatives of the soon-to-be independent union republics supported the idea of shifting to Latin script as a move away from Russia and toward Turkey. \\\\\"For leaders of the Central Asian republics, frightened by the growth of Islamic movements, and especially for Islam Karimov, the Turkish political model represented a real alterantive to both Islamism and the hegemonism of Moscow,\\\\\" the SOAS scholar continues. And in 1993, Karimov pushed through a law calling for that shift. Some progress has been made but it is far from complete. Schools have been using the Latin script, and consequently almost one in four adults now uses it. But except for school textbooks, most other publications remain in Cyrillic - and almost three-quarters of adults still prefer Cyrillic to the Latin script given that what they need is in Cyrillic, not Latin. For the rising generation to displace the Cyrillic group will take 30 to 40 years at a minimum, Ilkhamov says; and even when they are a majority, many of the books and publications on which Uzbeks will continue to rely will still exist only in Cyrillic and not in Latin script. It isn\\'t \\\\\"realistic\\\\\" to expect anything else, he concludes. And he cites with approval the comment of one Uzbek woman on Facebook: \\\\\"\\'To choose Cyrillic is not \\'a return to the past.\\' For we still haven\\'t left it.\\\\\" One needs only add the following: even if Tashkent doubled its spending on the transition, it wouldn\\'t be able to affect the sttus quo anytime in the next several decades.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Central Asian Militaries More Capable than Many Think, Kazakhstan Analyst Says\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 23 - Many in Moscow and the West dismiss the military forces of the five post-Soviet Central Asian countries, but they are wrong to do so, according to Marat Shibtov, a military affairs specialist at Alma-Ata\\'s Center for Military-Strategic Research, who says that in most cases, they have far greater defense capabilities than observers think.

It is important that such occasions can lead to actual assistance to the country in the future. In particular, we can tentatively expect some progress with the U.S. military aid to Ukraine. If Ukraine gets such military support, including lethal weapons, this will mean the formation of a bloc of Ukraine\\'s allies. Of course, there are foreign policy factors functioning without Ukraine\\'s participation. For example, there\\'s awareness in the West of the threat posed by Putin\\'s Russia, which leads to the fact that the Western international community is increasing its leadership positions. And this, in turn, goes in line with the need to support Ukraine. The West is constantly looking at Ukraine, wondering whether it can be considered an asset to the Western world and an important element of international security rather than a burden. I can\\'t say that the West is definitely ready to say that Ukraine is indeed an asset, but there are many indications and signals hinting at the fact that there are now more positive attitudes than negative ones. This means that Kyiv can count on the possibility of further strengthening of our defenses, including at the expense of Ukraine\\'s Western partners. On the other hand, Ukrainians shouldn\\'t get overwhelmed with parades and national holidays. They should note the number and types of newest military hardware and weapons that will be showcased at this year\\'s parade. In this regard, the situation is not too promising as over three and a half years of the raging war, nothing has been done to obtain strategic weapons. I am talking about air defense systems, combat aircraft, and powerful unmanned aerial vehicles, perhaps also strike drones. This situation is really alarming. Ukraine\\'s rearmament is limited to tactical steps (increasing the mobility of ground forces, introducing new communication systems, etc.). However, there are positive things as obtaining high-precision weapons. But in general, the process is only at its initial phase. If Ukraine keeps dragging on this path, in the next 50 years it will not become an effective instrument to deter Russia\\'s foreign aggression. It is necessary that Kyiv understands this and changes its approach. Today, Ukraine can\\'t afford having a Soviet-type 250,000-strong army, a large enough National Guard, and other state military formations, and at the same time spend more than 80% of its defense budget on \\\\\"maintenance\\\\\" without moving to an active rearmament of troops. So, such parades should become a symbol of a new understanding that Ukraine needs a new type of army. That is, at first the professional core of the army should appear, with an appropriate attitude toward this core. We are now witnessing such a negative trend as weaker patriotism, and this is due precisely to the erroneous development of the Ukrainian army. I stand for being proud of our army, making sure that the troops are professional and rearmed, that the army is smaller in number, while the issues of military draft are resolved through the territorial defense instruments. However, returning to the events scheduled for August 24, it should also be mentioned that Pentagon chief James Mattis on this day scheduled meetings with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak. Support from Pentagon is definitely very much needed in Ukraine, being a significant factor that should become a symbolic signal to the Kremlin that Ukraine may move under the umbrella of U.S. protection. Indeed, it may. But there\\'s still a long path to walk in this direction. Also important is the fact that Ukraine will be visited by U.S. special representative Kurt Volker, who ahead of the visit met with the Russian \\\\\"supervisor\\\\\" of the armed attack on Ukraine, Putin\\'s aide Vladislav Surkov. This is important because it means that the United States willingly consults with the Ukrainian side and does not pursue any talks behind Kyiv\\'s back. This is a significant encouraging factor for all observers in the process. Russia always reacts negatively to any formats of support for Ukraine and to Washington\\'s refusal to conduct a dialogue with Moscow in a mode, which the Kremlin was counting on. Therefore, I do not rule out that there may be provocations on Independence Day, including the escalation of tensions and more shellings in eastern Ukraine. It should also be borne in mind that today, Russia has substantially transformed its strategy and translated it into the political and social plane on the territory of Ukraine as a whole. That is, Russia implements it beyond the occupied Donbas and Crimea (the strategy has already been worked out there, aiming at making the regions pro-Russian and ensuring that they are subject to informational and psychological \\\\\"treatment\\\\\" by the Russian propaganda machine). As regards other regions of Ukraine, there is a threat of various terrorist acts and provocations with political and financial support of certain groups of Ukrainians who can either be used without their knowledge, as the Kremlin often does, or deliberately assist the aggressor for a certain pay, presenting their efforts as an \\\\\"alternative vision\\\\\" of Ukraine\\'s development. These things require improvement of the legal framework, especially with regard to politicians who voice pro-Russian slogans. And, of course, this requires strengthening of counter-intelligence efforts, to ensure that the strategy has been worked out clearly for responding to certain anti-Ukrainian manifestations.

We watched the preparation, and also found out how the current parade will be different from last year\\'s. - \\\\\"Strength! Glory to the heroes, death to the enemies! Always free! To the victories!\\\\\" Soldiers chant this, marching along the square. They are preparing to take part in the military parade, which will be held on August 24. After chanting, military personnel return to their initial positions - in the area of Bessarabska Square. From there, they will march towards Independence Square: in this direction everything is already as it should be at the parade, the orchestra is also ready. Viewers, strolling on a warm summer evening on the central street of Kyiv, like the military chants. Especially when they hear \\\\\"Death to the enemies!\\\\\", many people applaud. Rehearsal of the parade is being filmed on mobile phones. People in military uniform are also here today. Unlike ordinary onlookers, they are worried, actively sharing their impressions: \\\\\"Why they are late? Have they lost the distance?\\\\\" No, everything is fine \\\\\". Involuntarily public reminds association with a football match. The rehearsal was also visited by Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak. He traveled to the center of the capital by subway. Despite the fact that Khreshchatyk was closed for traffic, cafes, shops worked at it, as in ordinary evenings. When the military band did not play, the music from the violin concert of Vivaldi sounded in time with the musical fountains. In between the periods of rehearsal, the military were in a cafe, talking to their friends and relatives. A dozen guys with automatic rifles rested on the steps of the Kyiv City Administration building. Among the participants we saw many men who came to Kyiv for the first time. \\\\\"Never visited this city\\\\\", - said one of guys in the military uniform and asked another to photograph him on phone. Many other also photographed themselves: in groups and singly, against the backdrop of the administration, Khreshchatyk, co-workers. They do not rest for a long time: a pleasant male voice from the loudspeakers, which are set along the entire distance of the parade (the whole Khreshchatyk), mildly reminds them of another run.

[8] The South Korean government assesses that North Korea is able to produce most types of chemical weapons indigenously, although it must import some precursors to produce nerve agents, which it has done in the past. [9] At maximum capacity, North Korea is estimated to be capable of producing up to 12,000 tons of CW. Nerve agents such as Sarin and VX are thought be to be the focus of North Korean production. [10] According to the government-sponsored Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology [\\\\ud55c\\\\uad6d\\\\ud654\\\\ud559\\\\uc5f0\\\\uad6c\\\\uc6d0] in South Korea, North Korea has four military bases equipped with chemical weapons, 11 facilities where chemical weapons are produced and stored, and 13 dedicated research and development facilities. [11] Two facilities near the cities of Kanggye and Sakchu are reportedly equipped to prepare and fill artillery shells with CW agents. These two locations also allegedly test agents, possibly in large underground facilities. [12] However, there has been no open source evidence of new storage facilities. [13] North Korea\\'s weak economy has resulted in severe shortages of both energy and raw materials, making estimating the country\\'s CW production levels even more difficult. [14] It is possible that Pyongyang is allowing its existing CW cache to age due to these economic circumstances, which could make them unreliable on the battlefield -- if usable at all. This may be particularly true of what is thought to be the majority of the DPRK\\'s cache: unitary munitions which hold a single canister of lethal chemicals, rather than the more stable binary system, holding two or more stable chemicals which are combined at deployment.

Despite dire threats from the North over the years, South Korea has successfully relied on America\\'s nuclear umbrella for its ultimate security. Now North Korea\\'s increasing capability to directly to attack well beyond the borders of Korea has prompted heightened concern in Washington about US security. For decades the North has had the capability of inflicting huge damage on the megalopolis Seoul, including catastrophic loss of life, both Korean and American, civilian and military, even without nuclear weapons. Despite their most bellicose rhetoric, they have not dared initiate hostilities for they know their country would be utterly destroyed. Does their nuclear capability and delivery system increase the likelihood of their initiating an attack? They must know their ultimate destruction would be swift and certain and that has not changed. What has changed is the president\\'s threatening rhetoric. That brings us back to President Trump\\'s off-hand remarks. Does the president think by his stating publicly what has been known all along but never before issued as a direct threat, namely our capacity to utterly destroy North Korea, will now deter the North from continuing to develop its nuclear arsenal? Is he implying a willingness to make a preemptive strike should they persist? His fiery words have prompted much discussion of international law and the definition of a justified first strike. Questions are being raised as to whether this new situation makes such a strike acceptable legally and morally. There is no question concerning the legitimacy of using force for self defense. What is unresolved is whether North Korea\\'s possessing this new capability makes its use so imminent and inevitable that a preemptive strike is warranted and justified. On the other hand, to what extent does that new capacity mean North Korea itself is willing to risk a first strike? Probably not unless it concluded that the US intended to attack first, seeking to destroy their nuclear and missile capability. How would they make that determination? Do the president\\'s threats have the potential to convince them the US is prepared to make a preemptive strike? At least so far the North\\'s reaction to Trump\\'s fiery words cannot have given him much satisfaction. Their official response has been to ridicule his words as \\\\\"nonsense\\\\\". And from past experience we know President Trump cannot win the game of rhetorical chicken. North Korea has mastered the art of bellicose rhetoric, so when he states maybe he was not forceful enough he stoops to their level with little prospect of their standing down. We may be in the perilous zone of threat and counter threat, both made by vain and thin-skinned leaders. Saving face becomes the new necessity. That is why more responsible and mature leaders through the years have declined to voice such dire warnings. Threats can escalate beyond the point of no return. At some point they may be taken seriously. The world\\'s greatest power should be able to be counted on to exercise some restraint in its words even while wielding the biggest stick ever known. The real danger is that North Korea might finally conclude that Trump really means what he says. How tragic if our threats to deter them should prompt them to act precipitously, thus bringing about the very catastrophe we have for decades sought to avoid. How tragic if President Trump finally concludes that their dire threats and unwillingness to back down justify nuclear preemptive action. The result in either case would be catastrophe of untold dimensions, especially in South Korea. For no matter how successful we might be in destroying their nuclear arsenal, the havoc wreaked upon the Seoul megapolis by thousands of long range artillery is incalculable. For in addition to the millions in Seoul, there are well over one hundred thousand American civilian and military in the vicinity. And so far, Seoul, our staunch ally through the years, is not in the decision making loop concerning their fate. How sad. By James T.

From September 1, the Russians from the regions for a visa will have to go to the capital. And the citizens of Belarus, who recently were supposed to receive such visas in Moscow or St. Petersburg, - to go with documents to Kiev, Warsaw or Vilnius. The Russian financier and blogger Slava Rabinovich told about the Russian-American \\\\\"war of sanctions\\\\\" and the significance of the latest decision of Washington \\\\\"Apostrophe\\\\\". First of all, I want to remind readers that Russia did not respond at all with any sanctions to the law that was passed in the US by both chambers of Congress and signed by President Trump . The expulsion of American diplomats is only a delayed response by the Russian Federation to the expulsion of Russian diplomats, which was announced by President Obama in late December 2016. The only thing that Russia has done: the number of Russian diplomats expelled from America counted in dozens, and the number of American diplomats that Russia expels in hundreds. Although as a result, the US State Department was forced to reduce the vast majority of Russian citizens. Because among the hundreds of people that America had to cut in its diplomatic corps in Russia, it was Russian citizens who worked under contract with the American embassy and consulates in various cities of Russia. Accordingly, the Russian Federation did not respond to the law on counteraction to Russian, North Korean and Iranian threats. And here the question arises: could Russia have something to say? Especially as they like to talk - symmetrically. Symmetrically could not and could never. In any case, under Putin\\'s regime. Similarly, the entire history of sanctions and so-called counter-sittings has been going on for the past few years. What Putin and his OPG are doing is very well described by the phrase \\\\\"bombing Voronezh.\\\\\" Sanctions [US against Russia] began not from the moment when Russia attacked Ukraine, annexed the Crimea and unleashed a war in the Donbass. Sanctions and so-called counter-offenses began with the case of attorney Sergei Magnitsky, who died after about a year of bullying in prison, and the so-called \\\\\"Magnitsky Act\\\\\" against those people who violate human rights and are corrupt and thievish at the state level. Russia could not respond in a symmetrical way, they could not adopt a similar law. And they answered \\\\\"asymmetrically\\\\\": they forbade American families to adopt Russian orphans. It is well known that the overwhelming majority of the adoptions and adoptions of these orphans by the Americans were among sick children who were doomed to stagnation and slow death in orphanages and orphanages. And Americans took them to their families and spent money on them in the American health care system in such a way that ultimately the vast majority of these children were cured. These diseases are not treated in Russia, they are treated in the United States. This is the so-called symmetric answer - \\\\\"bomb out Voronezh.\\\\\" Then, as you remember, sanctions were introduced against the Putin regime in connection with the aggression against Ukraine. In response to these sanctions, they \\\\\"bombed Voronezh\\\\\" - through a food embargo, banning the import of the vast majority of high-quality food from those countries that imposed sanctions against Putin\\'s regime for aggression against Ukraine. And now, when in such a geographically large country as the RF, throughout its territory, there were American consulates with visa departments in order for Russian citizens to issue visas to the United States, so-called counter-attacks struck precisely on this mechanism, depriving Russian citizens of the opportunity relatively simply Receive American tourist visas, which are among the most liberal in the world in terms of the duration of the visa and the duration of the right to stay in the country. That is, Voronezh was bombed again. In fact, this will continue forever, as long as Putin\\'s regime does not cease to exist in one way or another. Firstly, because this regime has nothing to say symmetrically. Otherwise there would be no war of sanctions and confrontation with the West. It\\'s just a crumbling under-empire with post-imperial syndromes and post-Soviet nostalgia wrapped in a web of monstrous Putin\\'s kleptocracy. Secondly, \\\\\"bombing Voronezh\\\\\" will be until the conditional Voronezh will allow it to do. I think we are now witnessing how the Kremlin\\'s lie ceases to act on more and more people. An interesting element of this decision of Washington: Belarusian citizens will have to obtain visas no longer in Russia, but in Kiev, Warsaw or Vilnius (with some exceptions, since January 2017 Belarusians needed to obtain non-immigrant visas in Russia, Apostrophe). This is in the plane of a big and big political trolling: \\\\\"You, the Belarusians, you must decide.\\\\\" Trolling an even higher level would be to stop issuing visas to Russians in Moscow in general and the requirement to receive American visas at the US Embassy in Kiev.

The Kremlin uses the West 2017 military drills to test if Russia is ready for a large-scale war with the West. This was stated by Ukraine\\'s Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksandr Turchynov in his comment concerning joint Russia-Belarus military exercises. \\\\\"It\\'s not Russian Armed Forces that prepare for the great war, but a whole Russian state with the such material and other resources. Thus, during the West 2017 drills, the Kremlin checks how much the Russian Armed Forces and the state as a whole are ready for a big war with the West,\\\\\" he said. Russian railway is involved in the exercises. In particular, it is planned to transfer the control over the railway traffic to Military Communications Department of Russian Defense Ministry in areas of troops deployment. At the same time, military railway transportation is of priority importance and does not account trade and economic activity. The total number of wagons for the transfer of equipment and personnel only in the interests of the Ministry of Defense will exceed 7 thousand units. Only diesel locomotives will be used for military transportations (including on electrified sections of the railway) in order to prevent the disruption of military traffic in case of targeted cyber-attack or other unauthorized influences on the power network. \\\\\"We cannot exlude the use of offensive cyber-potential of the Russian Federation, in particular the relevant units of the Russian Armed Forces and the FSB, those that disguise themselves as criminal groups to implement a common strategic plan,\\\\\" Turchynov said.

That is normally seen as a disaster for the hardliners: they tried to topple Mikhail Gorbachev but failed, meaning that the country broke up, and Russia under Boris Yeltsin emerged onto the world stage -- a country which explicitly adopted multiparty democracy and capitalism, as well as Western principles of sovereignty and legality in international relations. The years since have been disappointing in many senses. For a start, Russia has gone from being a country that enjoyed worldwide acclaim for overcoming communism, to one that, under the nearly 18 years of rule by Vladimir Putin, is disliked and distrusted. The latest Pew Research findings show that 60 percent of people around the world, on average, express no confidence in the Russian leader. Only in Vietnam (83 percent), Greece (64 percent) and the Philippines (55 percent) does Russia have a positive rating. The Russian state is now mostly seen as a bully both at home and abroad. Only the current unpopularity of the United States masks the bleakness of the picture; most people polled by Pew said they disliked Donald Trump even more than Putin. Russia is seen as a cautionary tale in economic terms: a country that squandered its chances of economic modernization because it depended too much on natural resource industries. It has built no strong alliances abroad; it has failed to build institutions at home. Its soft power is based on a nihilist anti-Westernism, decrying other countries\\' political systems as abusive, failing and hypocritical, but offering nothing positive in return. The anniversary of the 1991 putsch is also a chance to ask some hard questions about what really happened. An excellent new book by Andrei Kovalev, a senior Soviet and then Russian diplomat -- \\\\\"Russia\\'s Dead End\\\\\" -- highlights some of the mysteries. Why was the coup so shambolic? What happened to the Communist Party\\'s money? Kovalev\\'s controversial contention is that far from being a defeat for the hardliners and the old KGB, the 1991 events in fact cleared the ground for their return. The Soviet Union was unmanageably large; Russia was easier to control. Capitalism offered more opportunities than communism. The destruction of the Communist Party allowed concentration of power elsewhere.\\\\n\\\\nThe Morning Vertical, August 22, 2017\\\\n\\\\nON MY MIND It is striking the degree to which Russian pundits and the Russian media are beginning to wade into the topic of life after Vladimir Putin. Not so long ago, the topic was practically taboo. It was less than three years ago, after all, when Vyacheslav Volodin famously said that \\\\\"there is no Russia today if there is no Putin.\\\\\" Now, suddenly, we have prominent sociologists like Sergei Belanovsky (in an interview and in a Facebook post, both featured below) proclaiming that \\\\\"the Putin era is coming to an end\\\\\" and that \\\\\"this is an incontrovertible fact which doesn\\'t depend on how much longer he remains president.\\\\\" And suddenly we have the St. Petersburg Politics Foundation publishing rankings of Putin\\'s potential successors -- and major Russian newspapers amplifying them (see stories by Gazeta.ru, Vedomosti, and Kommersant featured below). It\\'s all a bit odd given that Putin is widely expected to seek -- and all but certain to win -- a fourth term in the Kremlin in March. And it\\'s odder still given that, despite a growing protest mood in the country and the rise of Aleksei Navalny as an opposition force, there appears to be no clear and present threat to Putin\\'s rule, at least in the short term.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Putin\\'s Men No More Likely to Defend His System in a Crisis than Gorbachev\\'s Were in 1991, Krasheninnikov Says\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 21 - Those who mourn the demise of the USSR, especially on anniversaries of the August 1991 coup, should be asking themselves, Fyodor Krasheninnikov says, why \\\\\"if the USSR was such a great and happy country ... how did it happen that in 1991 there turned out to be traitors or incompetents?\\\\\" If they do so, he argues, they will quickly be forced to recognize that the greatest enemy of an authoritarian state is itself and that in some future crisis, Vladimir Putin\\'s people however loyal they may appear to be will turn on him and his system just as readily as did the CPSU and Soviet siloviki 26 years ago (snob.ru\\\\/selected\\\\/entry\\\\/128165). And such admirers of the Soviet system should also be asking how it happened that \\\\\"the quality of human material who turned out to be at the top of the Soviet power hierarchy\\\\\" was so pathetic that few if any of those who had pledged their lives to that system came to its defense at all. Instead, they allowed it to collapse without a fight. \\\\\"Not a single regional party or Komsomol worker could or more likely wanted to call into the streets soviet patriots about the existence of which for decades [Soviet leaders] had talked about from the highest tribunes.\\\\\" Instead, they showed themselves wavering, indecisive, or incompetent, as did the commanders of the Soviet military and the Soviet KGB. Indeed, Krasheninnikov continues, \\\\\"when Gorbachev refused to publicly support the clutch of putschists, this led them into a funk. They didn\\'t have any Plan B. [And] when Marshal Yazov ... found out about three accidently killed people, he personally decided to withdraw from Moscow the forces\\\\\" intended to defend the Soviet system. It is absolutely impossible to imagine Chilean General Pinochet responding in the same way to a refusal by President Allende to join the former\\'s putsch. For that difference, Russians should be grateful rather than appalled; but they should also reflect on what it says about the systems of rule under which they have lived. Just think about it, he continues. \\\\\"In 1987, Lenin\\'s cause still lived and triumphed but after only for years there wasn\\'t to be found anyone who would do anything for the salvation of his party and his state.\\\\\" This was truly \\\\\"a unique situation in world history: the rapid collapse and disintegration of a state without foreign intervention and civil war, exclusively as a result of internal contradictions, ambitions, and the incompetence of the leadership.\\\\\" Thus, he says, \\\\\"the greatest catastrophe wasn\\'t that the Soviet Union disappeared but that it existed and lasted as long as it did. The greatest catastrophe is that millions of people lived and died under repression and poverty for ideas and goals which in the final event no one was prepared to defend.\\\\\" At that time, \\\\\"our current rulers came out against the Soviet system\\\\\" which had raised them up: \\\\\"the future commander of the Russian Guard stood on a tank alongside Yeltsin, and the future President Putin together with the late Sobchak opposed the putsch in St. Petersburg,\\\\\" the Yekaterinburg political analyst says. But now \\\\\"aging in their completely capitalist villas, they regret not about Soviet social guarantees but about that which shouldn\\'t be regretted - about the imaginary geopolitical greatness, which \\'everyone feared\\' because it \\'cold transform the world into nuclear ashes.\\\\\" They do not recognize that \\\\\"the main enemy of any authoritarian regime is itself,\\\\\" including its inability to react adequately to a changing environment, the passivity of its officials which arises because they aren\\'t subject to competition, and the inevitable disaster that arises when loyalty is more important than active work. But there is a good reason why they don\\'t want to ask that question, Krasheninnikov says. It cuts too close to the bone. They would soon recognize that \\\\\"the party apparatus of United Russia is hardly more capable than that of the CPSU\\\\\" and that the governors the center imposes will not behave any differently that did \\\\\"Soviet obkom secretaries or tsarist governors.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Anger at Kremlin\\'s Nationality Policies Bubbles Up at Turkic Cultural Event\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 21 - For the first time in 20 years, the Turkic-language peoples assembled last week to share their common cultures; but the event became an occasion for sharp exchanges between those from Moscow who want to elevate the Russian language and a common civic Russian identity above all others and those who want to defend their nations. The meeting was organized by Moscow and Chuvash officials with the explicit purpose of promoting cultural links among the more than 12 million people in Russia who speak closely related Turkic languages, but it rapidly became something more, an indication that the Turks of Russia, long divided by Moscow, may be uniting to defend their common culture. And while there is a long road between expressions of anger at Moscow and of friendship among the Turkic peoples to political unity, this meeting served notice that the Russian authorities cannot count on their past divide-and-rule policies to keep these peoples and their eleven republics apart and thus easier targets for the Kremlin. Moscow\\'s policies and hopes were presented by Vladimir Zorin, a prominent Russian ethnographer, who began by admitting Moscow\\'s nationality policy is \\\\\"often criticized\\\\\" for being either about festivals or the suppression of conflicts and suggesting that it must focus on \\\\\"everything in between as well\\\\\" (idelreal.org\\\\/a\\\\/turki-rossii-chuvashia\\\\/28688104.html). Asked whether meetings like last weekend\\'s might lead to greater divisions among the peoples of Russia and particularly between large linguistic communities like the Slavic, the Finno-Ugric and Turkic peoples, Zorin insisted that was not possible: \\\\\"we already from the times of the formation of the state have lived together.\\\\\" \\\\\"We all together are today solving a two-in-one task: the formation of an all-Russian civic unity and the ethno-cultural development of all peoples who populate our country.\\\\\" According to Zorin, \\\\\"the term \\'civic Russian nation\\' \\'does not in any case contradict or reduce the meaning of the nation as an ethnos.\\\\\" He added that he \\\\\"very much likes the expression that Russia is a nation of nations. It objectively reflects the current moment.\\\\\" But if the Moscow ethnographer likes it, many of the participants suggested that the promotion of a civic Russian nation is \\\\\"the beginning of the end\\\\\" of the country. Alfinur Dibayeva from Orenburg asked \\\\\"How can we all be joined together if we are different nations? I am against this. Each nation has its own traditions, its own customs, its own language. The variant \\'nation of nations\\' is absolutely inappropriate. In the Russian nation, all our nations will be dissolved.\\\\\" \\\\\"I am not against Russia and am not opposed to be a civic Russian. But I am against one nation. I am a Tatar and will be a Tatar. I will always represent the Tatar nation,\\\\\" she said. \\\\\"But how will I teach Tatar if we will all have a Russian nation? What will be the national language\\\\\" in that event? According to her, \\\\\"we have lived in a fraternal fashion and will do so in the future without a civic Russian nation,\\\\\" however much some people want that. Indeed, she continued, \\\\\"the civic Russian nation is the very same thing that the Soviet people was: we are turning back to the past and thus may repeat the fate of the Soviet Union.\\\\\" [stress supplied] Elvira Khasanova, a Nogay from Astrakhan, said that from what she can see, Moscow is \\\\\"afraid that each nation will defend its rights and its sovereignty. But why shouldn\\'t this be the case? Now the self-consciousness of peoples has become higher and they want to acquire sovereignty.\\\\\" What then will remain of Russia? \\\\\"Only \\'the Golden ring\\'?\\\\\" The Nogays, she pointed out, have not been allowed to organize \\\\\"their own sovereign territory. We have a Nogay autonomous district in Daghestan but it isn\\'t allowed to unit with the Astrakhan Nogays.\\\\\" Moscow today is continuing the oppression of the Nogay people that dates to Catherine\\'s times.

Such a statist approach precludes the development of modern nationalism among Russians and means either that they will break out of Putin\\'s ideological straightjacket or find themselves stunted for yet another century or more while other nations based precisely on the people rather than the state or religion alone will be able to move forward.\\\\n\\\\nMany Russians aren\\'t protesting against Putin -- they want his help - The Washington Post\\\\n\\\\nThese are protests of policies, not the government.\\\\n\\\\nUAWire - Putin in Crimea: the influence of the government on the media in Russia has to be minimized\\\\n\\\\nThe creative community must itself filter TV and Internet content, and the state\\'s influence should be minimized in this sphere, declared Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 20 at the Tavidra forum that took place in the annexed Crimea. \\\\\"It would be right if the community itself developed a system of moral and ethical filters, to minimize if not to exclude, but it would be better, of course, to exclude the state\\'s influence on this process [the media],\\\\\" Russian News Agency TASS quoted Putin as saying. He added that he is in contact with the leaders of the country\\'s main television channels, as well as \\\\\"with those people who somehow influence what is happening in the Internet.\\\\\" \\\\\"I can say that they understand it themselves and try to change this situation for the better somehow. But in the modern world it is difficult to do so, to \\\\\"filter\\\\\" the stream of information, there are concerns that this filtration will become ideological and that society will be deprived of the opportunity to gain reliable, open, direct information,\\\\\" the Russian president said. This is the third Tavrida forum to be held in the Crimea. According to its organizers, the event attracts specialists from various industries: design and architecture, literature, visual arts and music, cinema and animation, journalism, museum issues and history teaching. The event is organized by the Russian Federal Agency for Youth Affairs and its subordinate institution Rospatriotcentr in partnership with the Moscow State Art and Culture University. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev arrived in the Crimea on August 18. They visited the Cossack Cove educational center, the Chersonese Taurian museum-reserve and the Opera in Chersonese music festival. Putin also met with Dmitry Ovsyannikov, the governor of Sevastopol appointed by Russia.

That is because everyone is at risk of criminal charges for reasons that no one can know in advance or often defend after they are advanced. In Soviet times, everything was clear and understandable, the Moscow blogger continues. One risked charges if one said that he or she didn\\'t accept Soviet power or its policies. In the US and Europe, the situation is equally clear. There are rules that define what one can do and what one can\\'t and thus one knows how to act (publizist.ru\\\\/blogs\\\\/34\\\\/19937\\\\/-). But in present-day Russia, nothing of the kind is clear. No one can be sure whether declaring \\\\\"Orthodoxy or death\\\\\" will meet with approval or be the basis of criminal charges. No one is certain what can be said about Syria without landing in difficulties with the Russian authorities. Everything in this area is confused and undefined. And something that may be perfectly fine at one moment can land one in prison in another. Posts five or more years ago online can come back to haunt the unwary - and what is especially worrisome anyone at all. As a result, one is afraid to even go on line or post anything there, Gladkov says. \\\\\"If the state likes such \\'hybrid\\' censorship - direct censorship as is well-known is prohibited by the Constitution,\\\\\" then it needs to be clear so that people will know what they can and cannot do. If the state doesn\\'t do that, it and not the population is guilty of \\\\\"the real extremism.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nRussian Theater Director Serebrennikov Detained On Suspicion Of Fraud\\\\n\\\\nKirill Serebrennikov, a prominent Moscow theater figure who has protested against the government, has been detained on suspicion of fraud, Russian officials say.

But while the world has looked away, the real costs of that public relations spectacular have continued to grow and in ways far more serious than can be measured by money alone. According to a report by three Krasnodar journalists which appeared in yesterday\\'s Kommersant, the failure of officials to check for infestations of a particular kind of moth in wood imported for Sochi Olympic construction now means that the entire region is at risk of losing possibly forever its unique stands of a rare tree (kommersant.ru\\\\/doc\\\\/3389734). The Colchid boxwood (Buxus colchica) had been growing in what is now southern Russia, Abkhazia, Georgia and portions of Turkey for more than 1.8 million years. Ecologists say it played a key role in regulating the chemistry of the water supply there and thus helped keep alive a variety of plants and animals. But because of official greed and incompetence and the push to build infrastructure for Putin\\'s Olympiad at any cost, these trees are being killed off throughout the region a moth that came to Western Europe from China in 2006, one that EU countries have successfully countered, but that jumped to the North Caucasus beginning in 2012. In only five years, stands of this ancient tree have been left \\\\\"at the edge of complete disappearance,\\\\\" according to Kommersant. Greed and a desire to show progress on a Kremlin-backed project is largely to blame for the death of many and the dying off of the rest, Boris Tuniyev, a Sochi ecologist says Especially unfortunate is the fact that the subtropical climate of the region where Putin chose to organize a winter Olympics gives the moths that eat the boxwoods greater chance opportunities to do their destructive work. Elsewhere, these moths may have only one generation per year; but in the North Caucasus, they have as many as four. Moreover, experts say - and they warned about this five years ago - the moths in question have no natural enemies in the Caucasus. Consequently, as they have multiplied, they have been able to eat the leaves of the boxwood and kill it with few chances that they can be stopped without human intervention. But that hasn\\'t happened in an effective way, environmental activists say, because \\\\\"in this case, legislation designed to protect the environment has interfered with nature.\\\\\" Russian laws block the use of chemical pesticides in protected areas, and so no one in the North Caucasus has been able to legally use them against the boxwood-destroying moths. People in the region have complained and asked for an exemption, but officials have simply folded their hands and said there is nothing they can do. This situation is further worsened by the fact that there are several countries and regions involved and little coordination among them. Killing the moths one place won\\'t stop them if they flourish elsewhere. Despairing of being able to save the boxwoods in the wild, activists and government scientists are now trying to raise new trees in greenhouses where they can prevent the moths from doing their worst. But that is a long-term strategy and one that will do little to stem the rising costs of the Putin Games. \\\\\"Even if they are able to save the boxwood\\\\\" in this way, one expert points out, that \\\\\"won\\'t correct the harm to nature already inflicted.\\\\\" Moreover, the boxwood \\\\\"grows very very slowly. In 70 years, it increases in height only by two or three meters.\\\\\" One will have to wait 500 years to see the trees at the same height many of them were before the Olympiad. \\\\\"Neither we nor our children will have see boxwood forests again,\\\\\" he says.\\\\n\\\\nBuxus - Wikipedia\\\\n\\\\nCourt Upholds Life Bans On Two Russian Athletics Officials In Doping Scandal\\\\n\\\\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport has upheld life bans on two former top Russian athletics officials for their parts in a doping scandal.

They\\'re quarreling about customs. And they\\'re squabbling about ports. For two countries that are supposed to be close allies, who are part of a \\\\\"union state,\\\\\" and who are about to hold massive joint military exercises, Russia and Belarus sure do seem to be bickering a lot. As Russian troops arrived in Belarus for next month\\'s Zapad-2017 war games, Russia banned some Belarusian dairy products. Vladimir Putin also publicly pressured Belarus to export its refined petroleum products via Russian ports, rather than those in the Baltic states, as Minsk prefers. And Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka used a recent interview on the Kremlin-controlled Rossia-24 state television channel to lash out at Moscow over the behavior of Russian customs officials and border guards. Meanwhile, rather than showcasing unity between Moscow and Minsk, the upcoming Zapad-2017 war games seem to be highlighting their differences. Belarus appears to be bending over backwards to make the exercises as transparent as possible and to reassure Minsk\\'s Western neighbors that they won\\'t be used as a platform for mischief. Russia appears intent on using the war games as a psyop. The ongoing discord between Minsk and Moscow is a stark barometer of the widening gap between Russia and its neighbors. Because, let\\'s face it, Belarus ain\\'t Ukraine and it ain\\'t Georgia. It\\'s a Russian client and it\\'s pretty safe to say that it won\\'t be seeking NATO or EU membership anytime soon. In fact, it\\'s often said that Russia wants to turn Ukraine and Georgia into Belarus. Well, Belarus already is Belarus. And the fact that its relations with Moscow are so persistently rocky speaks volumes.\\\\n\\\\nBelarus vs. Russia: the Battle for the Baltic States\\\\n\\\\nMoscow actually presented an ultimatum to Minsk, forcing to refocus the transit of refinery products to the Russian ports. Riga and Klaipeda can stay on a starvation ration. \\\\\"It is very significant that Vladimir Putin actually issued an ultimatum about switching the Belarusian transit routes just one month before the start of the Zapad-2017 exercise, that is, on the eve of the moment when Russian troops enter Belarus. That in itself has long caused great tension in the region, \\\\\"Andrei Aksenov, expert on economy of the civil campaign\\\\\" Our House \\\\\"commented on the situation to Rosbalt. - But Minsk also has arguments to defend itself. For example, last year, at the height of the \\\\\"oil and gas conflict\\\\\", Minsk raised the tariffs for the transit of Russian oil through its territory 1.5 times. And only when the problem issue in the sphere of energy supplies was settled, Belarus returned the previous tariffs for the transit of Russian oil. \\\\\" Indeed, today through Belarus transit is 25% of Russian gas supplied to Europe and 30% of Russian oil exported. That is, the \\\\\"transit war\\\\\", if it inflames, will be extremely unprofitable for both sides - both Moscow and Minsk. Another thing is that for Russia it will be just temporary troubles, but the Belarusian economy in such a situation can quite suddenly die.

Why should Europeans allocate money for the renovation of Ukraine\\'s infrastructure? The proposal by the Seimas (Parliament) of the Republic of Lithuania for a \\\\\"new European plan\\\\\" for Ukraine based on the \\\\\"Marshall Plan\\\\\" may seem too ambitious and even useless for the European Union. But, in reality, Europe should help Ukraine not only for the benefit of Ukrainians. It should help Ukraine primarily for itself The \\\\\"Marshall Plan\\\\\" provided enormous sums for the restoration of the European continent destroyed by war. But it was not charity. It was, in fact, genuine selfishness. The United States had been drawn into two world wars in the 20th century. It was in its interest to prevent the repetition of the past and to help transform Europe into a continent of well-being and mutual support. The results have exceeded all expectations. Today Germany and France -- the main adversaries in two world wars -- are the locomotives of the European Union and supporters of European unity. It is the countries that were not included in the \\\\\"Marshall Plan\\\\\" because of the Soviet occupation, whose citizens have spent decades in poverty and who still cannot reach the living standards of \\\\\"old Europe,\\\\\" that are increasingly returning to the past. So was American money spent in vain? European aid for Ukraine should be linked to the success of reforms in this second largest former Soviet republic after Russia. The experience of Georgia or Moldova does not need to be taken into account. They are small agrarian patriarchal countries whose successes and failures do not offer serious lessons. But Ukraine\\'s experience would serve as an example for the entire post-Soviet space, including Russia. Ukraine\\'s failure would demonstrate that this region cannot be reformed, and Ukraine\\'s success would show that even Russia can be reformed. And doesn\\'t the West want this? However, the one thing that the experience of Georgia or Moldova has shown is that without a noticeable improvement in the standard of living reforms decline rapidly and openly populist or pro-Russian forces become popular. Even if the Ukrainian government adopts all the necessary laws, changes the rules of the game, and creates opportunities for the free development of private initiative, Ukraine with its current economy will remain a poor country for several more decades. And in such a country citizens invariably vote for populists and demagogues. Only if Ukrainians see real changes for the better will they be capable of voting for reformers. And if they vote for reformers, this means that reforms will continue in the country. And if the reforms continue and succeed, Ukraine will provide a lesson for the entire post-Soviet space and advance its transformation. And this means that the border for Western values, democracy, and the free market will move steadily eastward. Don\\'t the sensible people in the West want this?

Imprisonment and war make people more brutal, and tougher. But the most important thing is to remain human and not become an animal. Yes, I still feel some discomfort and what I have experienced is still in me. But when I am with other people, I try not to show anger. Quite the contrary - I want to show good feelings.

View news.\\\\n\\\\nUkrainian broadcasting in Crimea: do Crimeans need it and how Russia will respond\\\\n\\\\nI think that the local residents will gradually begin to return to watching Ukrainian TV. That\\'s because the Ukrainian media are seeing a gradual decrease in the level of ideological fascination with Russia. We also struggle to get tiny bits of information from Crimea, obviously because the peninsula has been occupied by Russia. But even the amount of information that we are able to obtain shows one simple thing: after it became clear that Russia only needed Crimea to transform it into a military base, and nobody in Moscow cares about the actual interests of Crimeans, there has been some sobering up among the locals. Ukrainian TV channels traditionally offer a much better-built content than that produced by the Russians. So part of Crimeans, including Crimean Tatars, will watch Ukrainian TV channels just to get a breath of freedom. And those who are indifferent to Ukraine, who don\\'t care whose flag to fly just to avoid hostilities, those who called for Putin to come and now feel that everything is not quite as they expected, will simply be watching Ukrainian shows out of curiosity. It remains unclear how exactly Russia will respond to the start of Ukrainian broadcasting in Crimea. Russia has always made great bets on information wars. In this case, as a countermeasure, it is highly probable that Moscow will start jamming the signal. But we should not forget that jamming is a rather costly endeavor, even more expensive than the broadcast itself. In addition, jamming is a practice of the Soviet era, when \\\\\"enemy voices\\\\\" were silenced. Today, Russia\\'s return to an actual jamming of the signal, in my opinion, would be too much of self-humiliation and too much of a spit in the West\\'s face. So I don\\'t believe they will act this way. At the same time, I don\\'t rule out Russia acting on the principle of an unplanned signal. That is, they may launch broadcast of minor local channels and stations at the same frequencies with Ukrainian media, without even counting on whether anyone will watch or listen to them. This would be much cheaper, because this is not a total jamming.

Ever since then, I\\'ve found it hard to devote any professional time to issues that aren\\'t about life and death.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIn the years since his summer in Somalia, Rowswell, who grew up in Ottawa, has spent his diplomatic career in some of the world\\'s most dangerous settings: There was Baghdad following the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq; Kabul and Kandahar in Afghanistan from 2008 to 2010; and, for the past few years, Venezuela. Rowswell, now 47, was Canada\\'s ambassador to that now-crisis-ridden South American country until late last month and has since returned to Canada.\\\\n\\\\nAlong the way he\\'s seen the strengths and limits of state power, the devastating cost of putting staff into harm\\'s way, and he\\'s become a believer in a new, still-emerging force for the advancement of human rights and democracy: technology.\\\\n\\\\nAs he leaves Venezuela, Rowswell has taken a three-year unpaid leave from Global Affairs Canada, and has relocated himself and his three young children to Toronto, where he is launching a tech startup called Perennial Software.\\\\n\\\\nIt has begun making available an app called Udara which, if it meets the expectations of Rowswell and his co-founder, Farhaan Ladhani, will \\\\\"mobilize thousands and thousands, hundreds of thousands of people eventually, to take action directly in global affairs, whether its defending human rights or opposing corruption or protecting the environment.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIn Rowswell\\'s words, he\\'s dedicating himself \\\\\"to exploring and adapting technology for making the world a better place.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n*\\\\n\\\\nA passion for the world beyond staid central Canada runs generations deep in Rowswell\\'s family.\\\\n\\\\nGrowing up in the 1970s, raised by his mother in a modest Meadowlands Drive townhouse in what was then Nepean, Rowswell heard stories of his paternal grandfather and grandmother who, in the mid-1920s, lived in central China. Arthur and Katie Rowswell ran a hospital in Kaifeng during the Chinese civil war until political strife overtook the city, forcing them to flee and return to Toronto. On his mother\\'s side, relatives in the 19th and 20th centuries had adventures in the Canadian North.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"There was always the knowledge in the family that previous generations had kind of struck out and gone to some of the most unfamiliar corners of the earth,\\\\\" Rowswell says.\\\\n\\\\nAnd then, when Rowswell\\'s mother, Mary Marsh, married again, her second husband played a pivotal role in fostering her son\\'s international aspirations.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the early 1980s on, Rowswell\\'s step-father was Bill McWhinney, the first full-time executive director of Canadian University Service Overseas, and later a senior vice-president of the Canadian International Development Agency, who had lived in what was then Ceylon and travelled to 129 countries around the world.\\\\n\\\\nMcWhinney\\'s worldliness and wanderlust rubbed off not only on Ben but also on his older brother, Mark, who studied Chinese language and literature at universities in Toronto and then Beijing, and by 1990 had become stunningly famous in China as the TV entertainer nicknamed Dashan.\\\\n\\\\nMcWhinney, who died in 2001, \\\\\"really wanted us to explore the world,\\\\\" Ben says.\\\\n\\\\nWhile in Grade 11 at Nepean High School, Rowswell spent three months in Madrid in 1987 thanks to a high school exchange program.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It was at that point that I had that first inkling that I wanted to spend my life learning other languages and being immersed in other cultures and learning about other countries\\' politics,\\\\\" Rowswell says.\\\\n\\\\nHe found it fascinating that his Spanish host family thought favourably of their country\\'s late dictator, Francisco Franco. \\\\\"That, somehow, piqued my interest in how people can see world in different ways and try to understand the different perspectives they have.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nGraduating from Nepean, Rowswell knew that he wanted to study international relations in university. Although he had applied to some Canadian universities, he was educated in Washington, D.C., where he attended Georgetown University\\'s School of Foreign Service from 1989 to 1993, and was one of only a handful of Canadians enrolled there. \\\\\"Most couldn\\'t afford it,\\\\\" Rowswell says. But at that point, McWhinney was executive director for Canada at the Inter-American Development Bank headquartered in Washington and the IDB paid for Rowswell\\'s schooling.\\\\n\\\\nHe was at the training school for diplomats, the alma mater of Bill Clinton, during the end of the Cold War and the beginning of what was then called the New World Order, with foreign politicians regularly visiting the campus. \\\\\"It was a pretty extraordinary introduction to the practice of international relations,\\\\\" Rowswell says.\\\\n\\\\nThe school would make its imprint on his approach to diplomacy.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Obviously, I\\'m a member of the Canadian foreign service so, as a practitioner, I have this Canadian emphasis on norms and what the world should be like,\\\\\" Rowswell says.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"But having studied in the United States, I\\'m also quite impatient. ... Americans, because they have so much power, they\\'re focused as much on the achievement of results, and not just on what the results should look like eventually. So I think I\\'ve had a pragmatic bent in the practice of diplomacy that sometimes leads me to be a bit impatient with lack of results. When we confront major global issues, to me it\\'s never quite enough to say the world should be different, or this is what things should look like. I\\'m a lot more anxious to actually get to the solutions, to how we can use whatever instruments we have at our disposal right now.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAfter graduating from Georgetown, Rowswell took the summer job where he was nearly blown up. And, when that job end, he joined what was then External Affairs Canada.\\\\n\\\\nMcWhinney, he says, encouraged him to take that tack. \\\\\"I\\'d say without him, I probably would have stayed in Somalia, doing the UN peacekeeping thing, because that was my passion,\\\\\" Rowswell says.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"He was a very practical guy, and his view was I needed to have a career, a permanent job with an institutional home, and a pension and a benefits package and all that.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNonetheless, Rowswell did what he could to steer his work in the foreign service toward combat-zone postings.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I chose to learn Arabic, because the Middle East was the part of the world where the conflicts were most frequent and most intense,\\\\\" he says. \\\\\"I thought developing a Middle East specialty would be my ticket to getting opportunities to work on that problem set.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"He\\'s a truly exceptional colleague,\\\\\" says David Malone, who was the assistant deputy minister Department of Foreign Affairs when Rowswell was working in Iraq. \\\\\"I don\\'t think the department has ever produced anyone who has taken on as much risk.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nRowswell\\'s first full foreign posting was from 1996 to 1998 in Cairo -- which is where Malone, now the rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo and an under-secretary-general of the United Nations, first met him.\\\\n\\\\nMalone says it was already obvious that Rowswell \\\\\"didn\\'t want one of those classic careers where you bounce between Paris and Washington and perhaps New York, comfortably. He was quite serious about the extended Middle East. Also he was a risk-taker. He was quite willing to go the most dangerous places.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAfter Cairo, Rowswell ratcheted down the danger, pursuing graduate studies in international relations at Oxford University and then working in Ottawa at the Privy Council Office after 9\\\\/11.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, Rowswell says that it was only in 2003, when he was able to deploy to Iraq, that he truly started to set his own path and follow his interests.\\\\n\\\\n*\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The destinies of the United States and the Middle East were very clearly going to collide in Iraq, and I wanted to be at the heart of the collision,\\\\\" Rowswell says.\\\\n\\\\nThen-prime minister Jean Chr\\\\u00e9tien wanted Rowswell -- or more correctly, someone like him -- to be there too, Malone says. While Chr\\\\u00e9tien kept Canada out of the U.S-led coalition that toppled Saddam Hussein, the Canadian government wanted \\\\\"a civilian on the ground to assess whether there was anything Canadian might be able to contribute from a civilian, non-military perspective,\\\\\" Malone says.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I\\'d been really lobbying to get to Baghdad, and the opportunity came in August 2003,\\\\\" Rowswell said. \\\\\"I was basically just told to get on a plane and get off in Baghdad and figure things out for myself ... where to stay and how to avoid danger, and how to make myself useful to the Coalition Provisional Authority.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMalone says that \\\\\"Baghdad was ferociously dangerous\\\\\" when Rowswell was there. While the U.S. had established a 10-square-kilometre \\\\\"safe zone\\\\\" called the Green Zone in central Baghdad, \\\\\"it wasn\\'t safe at all,\\\\\" Malone says.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"All sort of ordinance was lobbed into it, there were shootings regularly at the entry points of the Green Zone. Ben wound up living in a (shipping) container; there were very few permanent buildings left in the Green Zone.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nRowswell reported nominally through Canada\\'s ambassador to Jordan, who was not allowed to visit Iraq because of the danger, Malone says.\\\\n\\\\nRowswell, Malone says, \\\\\"was always at great risk, sometimes more than he realized. We in Ottawa were privy to a great deal of American and British intelligence. Ben knew what was going on, on the ground, but he didn\\'t necessarily know the meta story of what various warlords were planning for the Green Zone. Whereas we occasionally heard about that. We worried about him tremendously.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSeveral times, Foreign Affairs pulled Rowswell out of Baghdad for short periods because of perceived dangers. \\\\\"He always protested vociferously when we did it, because he didn\\'t have access to that intelligence. Even if he had, he wouldn\\'t have wanted to leave.\\\\\" Malone says.\\\\n\\\\nRowswell says he was struck by two themes during his two years in Iraq.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"One of them was to yet again see the limits of how far a state power can get you. The Americans -- by far the most powerful country in the world -- biting off way more than they could chew in Iraq. They couldn\\'t handle Somalia and they were in way over their head in Iraq, as the world has subsequently found out. I got to see that up close and personal and that was pretty ugly to see at short range.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAs well, Rowswell was fascinated by the \\\\\"surprisingly deep passion that Iraqis had for democracy.\\\\\" In January 2005, Iraq held its first free and fair elections in two generations, and Rowswell says that what he saw ran counter to expectations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The received wisdom in foreign policy circles was that democracy was not appropriate for Arabs and the Middle East, and was kind of a silly dream, or somehow imposed by the United States on reluctant Iraqis,\\\\\" he says. \\\\\"Yet what I saw on the ground was the exact opposite. The Iraqis were ferocious in demanding free and fair elections and wanting to take control of their own lives.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n*\\\\n\\\\nWhen his time in Iraq ended, Rowswell enjoyed another stint in Ottawa, where he created and headed a unit at Foreign Affairs charged with fostering democracy abroad. The unit still exists, and Rowswell calls its creation one his career\\'s greatest satisfactions.\\\\n\\\\nBut Rowswell returned to a war zone in 2008, throwing his abilities into Canada\\'s engagement in Afghanistan.\\\\n\\\\nAt first, he was the deputy head of mission at Canada\\'s embassy in Kabul. Rowswell quickly highlights the best thing that happened to him there: In Kabul, at the airport, he met his future wife, Kate, who was working for the British NGO Turquoise Mountain. \\\\\"So the reason I\\'m no longer doing the conflict circuit is that I met her and fell in love and we now have three kids.\\\\\" The couple met at Kabul\\'s Hamid Karzai International Airport in January 2009 and got engaged in early September that year at the Burning Man Festival in Nevada.\\\\n\\\\nKandahar, where Rowswell from 2009 to 2010 picked up the moniker the \\\\\"ROCK\\\\\" (Representative of Canada in Kandahar), there was another happy meeting. Rowswell\\'s director of communications was Farhaan Ladhani, who would go on to work with him on tech projects affecting Egypt and Iran before they founded Perennial Software. Ladhani \\\\\"had more experience and more expertise in the use of digital technology than anyone I knew,\\\\\" Rowswell says.\\\\n\\\\nThe magnitude and importance of the work there made the Kandahar assignment \\\\\"exhilarating and exhausting,\\\\\" Rowswell says.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It was pretty extraordinary to be at the heart of that effort (to rebuild Kandahar) because we were throwing everything we could as a nation at that,\\\\\" he says. \\\\\"We had 3,000 troops on the ground, We had 81 civilians, which was by far the largest deployment of civilians in any war zone in Canadian history. Kandahar was at the heart of the American effort, too, and Obama got elected and had the troop surge of 10,000 troops; they were mostly based in Kandahar as well.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWilliam Crosbie, who was Canada\\'s ambassador to Afghanistan when Rowswell was in Kandahar, said that Rowswell was an \\\\\"exceptional diplomat and manager\\\\\" and \\\\\"a leader in difficult times.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nCrosbie vividly recalls witnessing Rowswell\\'s keen ability to connect with Afghans during a visit to Kandahar\\'s chief of police.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We were all nervous about that visit, including my close protection team. The chief had been the target of many suicide attacks,\\\\\" Crosbie says. \\\\\"The police station bore the scars of these attacks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The chief wanted to host me for lunch; it was a traditional way to entertain a large number of his fellow officers using the excuse of a visiting HOM (head of mission). I did not want to dine in the police station -- the threat of attack the longer you are there, the risk of food ailments. So Ben changed the time of the meeting and we arrived earlier in the morning. It didn\\'t matter. A huge spread of food was laid out on an enormous table in a filthy room. Steaming dishes of boiled goat and other meats. I stuck to the rice and bananas. Ben dug in to the delight of our hosts. As he kept filling his plate with various delicacies and talking to the chief, it was clear how much he was liked and respected.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps the most gruelling moment for Rowswell came in late December 2009, when he received terrible news while home for Christmas in Canada, visiting his brother in Prince Edward Island. A phone call told him that a massive IED had killed four soldiers and Calgary Herald journalist Michelle Lang, and injured several others, including a young political officer, Bushra Saeed, who lost her leg. Hearing of the attack, Rowswell says, was \\\\\"heartbreaking.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"He was absolutely devastated,\\\\\" Kate Rowswell says of her husband. \\\\\"I\\'m not sure he\\'ll ever get over that completely. He felt responsible. Immediately he wanted to rush back and be there to try and help in some way, and of course, he felt guilty that he hadn\\'t been there.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"He really cares for the people who work for him and the people in these situations of conflict. He takes the position very seriously and very personally,\\\\\" she says.\\\\n\\\\nBut the tragedy did not shake Rowswell\\'s commitment to doing what he does. \\\\\"What it did reinforce for me is that Canadian foreign policy is about some pretty harsh realities. The world is very dangerous place, and Canada, I think rightly, has aspirations to have a positive impact. That means we have to be in some very dangerous places and put our staff at risk. It\\'s only when we do that, that we really understand what\\'s happening and are able to have a positive impact, as we did in Kandahar.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n*\\\\n\\\\nAfter Afghanistan, Rowswell took a break from the foreign service. A year-long sabbatical allowed him to honeymoon, and also explore a growing interest in technology, which he studied at Stanford University in California.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, his goal was always to deploy technology in the service of the same goals he\\'d had as a diplomat -- bolstering democracy, supporting human rights and more.\\\\n\\\\nPlus, his time at Stanford coincided with the Arab Spring, that saw the leaders of Tunisia and then Egypt, where Rowswell had been posted in the late 1990s, taken down by people power.\\\\n\\\\nWhen Rowswell saw the mass protests in January 2011 in Cairo\\'s Tahrir Square, he thought: \\\\\"I just knew that I had to be there. ... This was a cause that I\\'d been involved in, there were actors I knew well, activists I knew well. With my interest in human rights and in Egypt and in technology coming together, there was no question that I had to get on a plane and get over to Egypt and be part of it.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nDuring the first of three trips to Egypt in 2011, Rowswell met with activists working with human rights crusader Mohamed Mustafa ElBaradei, who told him that they wanted to get as many Egyptians as possible participating in an online debate about human rights protections that should be in their constitution. Rowswell took that idea back to Stanford, and after a \\\\\"madcap 48 hours,\\\\\" he and his colleagues had built an Arabic website -- the Cloud to Street project, Rowswell calls it -- that would allow 18,000 Egyptians to participate in the drafting of their constitution.\\\\n\\\\nEven if, as Rowswell says, \\\\\"the story of Egypt went off in a different direction,\\\\\" his project \\\\\"was a demonstration of how feasible and tangible it is to do something that\\'s completely different in international relations by using technology. If you come up with the right idea, you can get tens of thousands of people, effectively overnight, involved in a political process that they weren\\'t involved in earlier.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n*\\\\n\\\\nAfter his sabbatical at Stanford, Rowswell was nominated to be Canada\\'s next head of mission in Iran. He was supposed to go out in summer of 2012 and moved back to Ottawa to begin Farsi language training. Then, Canada decided to close its embassy in Tehran.\\\\n\\\\nStill the government asked Rowswell if, given his interests in technology, there might be a way to use the internet to advance Canada\\'s foreign policy objectives in Iran. \\\\\"Which is a pretty tall order, right?\\\\\" Rowswell adds. \\\\\"You close your bricks and mortar institution, and then ask a diplomat to have an influence -- it just doesn\\'t work that way normally.\\\\n\\\\nRowswell figured he could meet the order by creating a set of websites and social media sites so that Iranians could have online conversations about their country. He oversaw the creations of what was the internet-based Global Dialogue on the Future of Iran, even if at the time, Rowswell says \\\\\"the internet was not taken seriously as a tool for foreign policy.\\\\\" When Rowswell was asked how many Iranians the project might engage, it pulled the number 40,000 out of his head, but eventually the project drew five million unique users.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"At no point does this ever compete with the influence that Canada could have in having a bricks and mortar embassy, and having diplomats on the ground,\\\\\" Rowswell says. But on the other hand, the effort, he says, did end up \\\\\"being a much more direct and tangible contribution to human rights than a lot of what the international community is able to accomplish.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nRowswell brought his advocacy for what he calls \\\\\"direct diplomacy\\\\\" to Venezuela, when he became ambassador to that country in 2014.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We established quite a significant internet presence inside Venezuela, so that we could then engage tens of thousands of Venezuelan citizens in a conversation on human rights,\\\\\" Rowswell says. \\\\\"We became one of the most vocal embassies in speaking out on human rights issues and encouraging Venezuelans to speak out.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBut even as Rowswell was using social media and the internet for outreach to Venezuelans, the Venezuelan government, he says, was countering him in cyberspace.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Authoritarian regimes like Venezuela are now quite sophisticated in their use of digital tools to maintain themselves in power,\\\\\" Rowswell says. \\\\\"As part of that, they have a 21st century approach to propaganda through the planting of stories that appear to be independent, but then are promoted by bots.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"As Canada\\'s become more and more effective at using digital technology to promote human rights, those that feel threatened by the defence of human rights have also become more and more adept at using those tools to discredit Canada and discredit Canadian diplomats. That\\'s all part of the learning process as we discover what foreign policy is all about in the 21st century.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nJust as so many things have, foreign policy is moving from the physical world to online, Rowswell says. \\\\\"This is going to be the story of 21st century international relations -- how values get projected and debated and discussed online, and how various actors, including everything from individual citizens all the way up to nation states, advance their interests and their views of the world through digital technology.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOn July 27, Rowswell tweeted, in Spanish: \\\\\"Yesterday I finished my assignment as Ambassador of #Canada to #Venezuela. It was an honour to defend the values shared by our two peoples.\\\\\" His tweet received more than 8,200 retweets, mostly from supporters in Venezuela, he says.\\\\n\\\\nThe country remains in crisis. There are nearly daily demonstrations. President Nicolas Maduro has been widely accused of moving toward a full-blown dictatorship, while his government has charged that opposition figures are conspiring with the United States and other foreign influences.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I think that some of them were sort of anxious that it (the embassy\\'s support for human rights and democracy in Venezuela) might not continue after I left,\\\\\" Rowswell said. \\\\\"I don\\'t think they have anything to worry about because Minister (of Foreign Affairs Chrystia) Freeland has Venezuela way at the top of her priority list.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n*\\\\n\\\\nRowswell describes leaving the security of his public service job with typical sang-froid and humour. \\\\\"With three small children in tow, doing that without a salary, it\\'s certainly something that focuses the mind,\\\\\" he says.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It was now or never basically,\\\\\" his wife, Kate, says. \\\\\"The time to do this is when you\\'re under the age of 50. It was something he had to try because it\\'s his passion. You can\\'t suppress that sort of instinct if you have it. You have to follow your heart and give it try.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nPerennial, which has a staff of eight, moves into its office in September. Already, its first creation, the mobile-only website udara.online, enables Torontonians to take part in local civic actions, such as assisting with the settlement of Syrian refugees.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"If you\\'re interested in an issue or a cause, but don\\'t know what to do about it, the software recommends a specific task you could do in an hour or two that is suited to your own particular skills and interests,\\\\\" Rowswell says.\\\\n\\\\nWith Udara, the creation of Perennial Software, Rowswell hopes there will be an app to one day empower people around the world who are striving as the Iraqis were.\\\\n\\\\nHis goal is to grow the company, slowly expanding the number of causes that are available for citizens to take action on, and the number of countries, and eventually the number of languages. Naturally, he would like to see Udara active in the Middle East in Arabic, and in Latin America in Spanish. \\\\\"We want be become the global platform for civic action,\\\\\" he says.\\\\n\\\\nRowswell feels that he\\'s on the right track with Perennial, having seen, as close-up as anyone has, the last decade\\'s rise of technology-enhanced people power.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"There are many people that could be effective Canadian ambassadors abroad,\\\\\" Rowswell says. \\\\\"But not many people that had enough exposure to technology and human rights activism in the field that could combine those two and could create some dramatic new outcomes in global affairs.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nphum@postmedia.com\\\\n\\\\ntwitter.com\\\\/peterhum\",\"url\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/ottawacitizen.com\\\\/news\\\\/local-news\\\\/ben-rowswell\"},\"52\":{\"source\":\"To Inform is to Influence\",\"text\":\"Anonymous expert compilation, analysis, and reporting.\\\\n\\\\n<\\\\/end editorial>\\\\n\\\\nConcerns over Zapad 2017 persist.

A year later, that is surely the case with Russia\\'s secret attempt to meddle in the U.S. presidential election, which has brought a string of adverse unintended consequences for...\\\\n\\\\nWhat stands behind Russia\\'s defense budget cut\\\\n\\\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\\'s move to reduce the country\\'s defense budget is a direct consequence of a three-year international sanctions regime against Russia, which among other spheres targeted the Kremlin\\'s military-industrial complex. Moreover, given that over the recent period global prices for energy resources, which remain Russia\\'s main source of income, have fallen significantly, Moscow has no alternative but to reduce its defense budget to support the financing of social programs. Over these three years, Russia has completely exhausted one of its two reserve funds, and now it is already using the money from the second one, the \\\\\"National Welfare Fund.\\\\\" This suggests that the financial situation in Russia is becoming ever more complex, including the rising budgetary problems. It is because of these problems that Russians are forced to cut their military expenditures in order to support the financing of other spheres. Almost half of Russia\\'s defense expenditures are classified However, it should be noted that almost half of Russia\\'s defense expenditures are classified, so finding out the real volume of defense financing is quite difficult. However, it is now reported that the reduction will be at 2.7%-2.8% of GDP. In this case, it is about the open part of the financing of troops. Meanwhile, the classified part remains secret. Therefore, it is difficult to draw a conclusion on how the reduction will affect the defense capability of the Russian Federation in general. Given the \\\\\"skills\\\\\" of Russian propaganda, in Russia, any fact can be presented as a positive decision, while the Kremlin leadership is portrayed as the wisest. So the decision of the Russian authorities will be presented by Russian propaganda as Moscow\\'s willingness to peacefully settle any conflict and a step toward the rapprochement with the West in response to the fact that the West is increasing its defenses both within NATO and in regards to the defense budgets of individual countries. The Russian media will spin the information in a way to show that Russia, unlike the hated Westerners, reduces army expenditures and cares more about the citizens of the Russian Federation. It is difficult to predict whether the trend toward the reduction of Russia\\'s defense budget will prevail. After all, it\\'s not clear yet, what will be Russia\\'s position on conflicts and wars in which Moscow is involved: whether it is going to move toward escalation or gradually curtail its aggression in Ukraine and Syria. It is these plans and intentions that will affect the dynamics of financing of the Russian army. Andriy Novak is a Chairman of the Committee of Economists of Ukraine\\\\n\\\\nRussia and Putin Viewed Negatively Worldwide | Pew Research Center\\\\n\\\\nBut few see Russian power and influence as a major threat By Margaret Vice Around the world, few people trust Russian President Vladimir Putin to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs. A global median of roughly one-in-four (26%) say they have confidence in the Russian leader. Doubts about Putin\\'s handling of foreign policy, however, do not necessarily coincide with perceptions of Russia as a security risk. Across 37 countries, a median of 31% describe Russia\\'s power and influence as a major threat to their country - identical to the median percentage who say the same about China, and similar to the median share (35%) that sees America\\'s power and influence as a large threat. On balance, Russia\\'s international image is more negative than positive. Critical opinions of Russia are particularly widespread in the United States and Europe, while views are more mixed in the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. In only three countries surveyed do majorities express a favorable opinion of Russia: Vietnam (83%), Greece (64%) and the Philippines (55%). Many people doubt the Russian government\\'s commitment to civil liberties. Globally, a median of 30% say Russia respects the rights of its citizens, compared with 46% who disagree and 17% who do not offer an opinion. Skepticism about the protection of personal freedoms in Russia is widespread in the U.S. and Europe. Views are mixed across the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America, while publics in sub-Saharan Africa are more convinced than not that the Russian government safeguards individual liberties at home. These are among the major findings from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted among 40,951 respondents in 37 countries outside of Russia from Feb. 16 to May 8, 2017. (For views from within Russia, see \\\\\"Russians Remain Confident in Putin\\'s Global Leadership.\\\\\") Europeans are particularly harsh in their assessment of Putin, with a median in Europe of 78% expressing a lack of confidence in the leader. In the U.S. and Canada, few are confident in Putin\\'s global leadership, with more than three times as many people disliking Putin as liking him. In a handful of nations (Vietnam, the Philippines, Tanzania and Greece), half or more are positive on Putin\\'s international performance. In other nations, many do not express any view of him: Roughly one-third or more in India, Indonesia, Ghana, Senegal, South Africa and Argentina do not share an opinion on the Russian leader. Though Putin and Russia receive low ratings across much of the world, few see Russian power and influence as a major threat to their nation. Russia is seen as far less threatening than other issues such as the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) and climate change in every nation surveyed except for Poland and Jordan. A global median of 31% say that Russian power poses a major threat to their nation, compared with 62% for ISIS, 61% for climate change and 51% for cyberattacks from other countries and for the condition of the global economy. In fact, among the eight threats tested, Russia\\'s power and influence is tied with that of China for last place (median of 31%). (For views on global threats, see \\\\\"Globally, People Point to ISIS and Climate Change as Leading Security Threats.\\\\\") Generally, the Russian government is not seen as respecting the personal freedoms of its people. Across the 37 nations surveyed, a median of only 30% believe that Russia adheres to this tenet of democracy; that is lower than those who believe the same of France (60%, excluding France\\'s figures) and the U.S. (54%, excluding U.S. figures) but higher than for China (25%). Both Americans (80%) and Canadians (73%) widely feel that Putin\\'s government does not respect personal freedoms. Similarly high shares feel this way in most European countries surveyed. In the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific, views vary among the countries polled. Majorities in Tunisia, Lebanon, Vietnam and the Philippines think Russia respects civil liberties, while publics elsewhere in these regions are split on the issue.\\\\n\\\\nPoll: only three countries in the world have positive perception of Russia - To Inform is to Influence\\\\n\\\\nThis is a remarkable change from two years ago.

This is nothing new: Russia dissolves diaspora groups regularly, and policies toward diaspora groups on Russian soil work to serve Russia\\'s interests both at home and abroad. It is likely that in 2001, when ARAC was formed, that it was not wholly a grassroots effort by Azerbaijani diaspora members, and was at least coopted and funded by Russia. At the time, the Russian Orthodox Church and Vladimir Putin gave their blessing to the formation of the organization. It was only when Russia no longer had control over the organization and it failed to serve Moscow\\'s interests that the group was dissolved. A comparison with Russia\\'s control over two other diasporic communities, Georgian and Tajikistani, shows a pattern of Moscow\\'s long-term policy and actions regarding diasporic communities. While much research has been done on how Russia utilizes its diasporas in places like the Baltics in hybrid warfare, Russia\\'s weaponization of foreign diasporas on its own soil is underexplored. An understanding of how diaspora organizations are formed in Russia and by whom, how they are funded, what their goals and aims are, and how these goals are carried out sheds light on how Russia might act to bring the Azerbaijanis diaspora back under Kremlin control.\\\\n\\\\nThe Ghosts Of August\\\\n\\\\nIn Russia, August is often been a month of political watersheds; when old eras die and new ones are born.\\\\n\\\\nThe Morning Vertical, August 18, 2017\\\\n\\\\nON MY MIND August is half over and so far it has been relatively quiet. There have been no disasters, coup attempts, invasions, or other dramatic events that have caused annual speculation about Russia\\'s \\\\\"August curse.\\\\\" Vladimir Putin has been keeping a low profile, and even disappeared from public view for a week. But this also has the feeling of a calm before the storm. Russia is entering a potentially volatile political season with Putin set to seek a fourth term in elections in March, amid rising discontent over corruption and falling living standards. Aleksei Navalny will probably not be allowed on the ballot to run against Putin, but nevertheless he will be a major factor in the elections. Moscow\\'s war in eastern Ukraine simmers on with periodic and sinister hints that it could escalate at any time. And tensions with the West remain high as Russia prepares to hold the Zapad 2017 joint military exercises with Belarus -- the largest war games since the end of the Cold War -- near NATO\\'s borders in September. On this week\\'s Power Vertical Podcast, we\\'ll take advantage of the (so far) quiet \\\\\"cucumber season\\\\\" to take stock and look at potential tempests below the surface in Russian domestic politics and foreign affairs. Joining me will be two veteran Kremlin-watchers: Donald Jensen, a former U.S. State Department official, a fellow at the Center for Transatlantic Relations in the Nitze School of International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis; and James Sherr, an associate fellow with Chatham House\\'s Russia and Eurasia program, a senior fellow at the Institute of Statecraft, and author of the book Hard Diplomacy And Soft Coercion: Russia\\'s Influence Abroad. So be sure to tune in later today!\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: Putin\\'s Lower Profile This Summer Reflects Desire to Project New Image, Experts Say\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 17 - Even though Vladimir Putin reappeared yesterday after a week of being out of public view (themoscowtimes.com\\\\/news\\\\/putin-watch-over-before-it-even-started-58678), the Kremlin leader\\'s personal activities this summer have been significantly less frequent than in earlier years, experts say. They argue that this reflects his desire to present himself in a new way, as a severe but caring father of the nation who focuses on his official duties rather than youthful leader full of vigor with an active private life, a stance he adopted earlier to underscore the differences between himself and his predecessor Boris Yeltsin. In an article today, two URA.ru journalists, Mikhail Vyugin and Aysel Gereykhanova surveyed a variety of commentators as to why there have been significantly fewer well-covered personal activities of the Russian president this year than there were in earlier summers of his rule (ura.news\\\\/articles\\\\/1036271854). \\\\\"For the first time in the last five years, summer has not become a season of \\'popular\\' news from Russian President Vladimir Putin,\\\\\" they write, a change that is striking because \\\\\"Russians are accustomed to the idea that summer is a time for demonstrating ... that he is not only a leader but a man able to combine work with relaxation and hobbies.\\\\\" Vyugin and Gereykhanova survey Putin\\'s activities over the last decade during the summer months and point out that this summer is especially less busy than the last pre-election summer of 2011. Then, Putin went to the bottom of the Taman Gulf, bringing up two amphoras, and took part in a motor-show with the Night Wolves, arriving on a Harley-Davidson. This year, however, the Kremlin leader has been much less in the public eye as far as his private activities are concerned. Valery Fadeyev, the secretary of the Russian Social Chamber, says that instead, Putin has visited the regions where gubernatorial elections are scheduled to give support and direction. Political analyst Oleg Matveychev of the Higher School of Economics, suggests that \\\\\"it would be strange\\\\\" for Putin to behave now the way he did six years ago. He doesn\\'t have to show that he is vigorous; he only needs to show that he is focused on issues of concern to the Russian electorate. Dmitry Orlov, head of the Altay Industrial College, sees a more fundamental shift. Putin, he says, has decided to portray himself now as \\\\\"a wise father\\\\\" of the nation who takes into account the views of all the people in Russia. He doesn\\'t need to appeal to any one group or collection of groups as he may have had to earlier. In 2012, Orlov continues, Putin was organizing a conservative majority, but \\\\\"today he is the leader of the nation. There is thus no need to call focus on any specific group because there are no threats from the opposition as there were in 2011-2012.\\\\\" An anonymous source, identified only as someone \\\\\"close to the Kremlin\\\\\" agrees. He says that Putin is entering the current elections as \\\\\"\\'the president for all\\'\\\\\" and \\\\\"will speak with each electoral group.\\\\\" That is why he has adopted \\\\\"a compromise position\\\\\" on issues like St. Isaac\\'s, housing renovation in Moscow, and the film Mathilda. This same source adds that Putin\\'s relatively infrequent appearances as a private person are part of this effort: They are intended to generate interest among the population as to when and what he might do next, much as the absence of television shows in the summer months leading to speculation about \\\\\"a new season of a favorite serial.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: \\'Crimea is Ours but Novosibirsk Oblast Maybe Not So Much,\\' Some Russians Fear\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 17 - Journalists often refer to August as \\\\\"the silly season\\\\\" because stories that wouldn\\'t normally pass muster are published in the absence of other news, but sometimes these otherwise neglected stories can at least in part shed light on larger issues and thus deserve attention. For the last week, the Russian media, electronic and otherwise, has been filled with stories about the drying out of a lake on the Russian-Kazakhstan border, with some saying that Moscow has ceded a few hectares of territory to Astana, others denying that, and still others saying everything will return to normal when the rainy season come again. Among them are those atkasparov.ru\\\\/material.php?id=599475D40AEBD, ej.ru\\\\/?a=note&id=31452, and regnum.ru\\\\/news\\\\/society\\\\/2310718.html). But far and away the most comprehensive is a report by Novosibirsk journalist Pyotr Manyakin (meduza.io\\\\/feature\\\\/2017\\\\/08\\\\/17\\\\/gde-nahoditsya-granitsa-nikto-ne-ponimaet). Last Thursday, local Russian officials on the border posted online a report saying that the drying out of Lake Sladkoye on the Russian-Kazakhstan border meant that as of now, it is completely part of the territory of Kazakhstan. But the notion that Russia had ceded any land to anyone was so abhorrent that soon that statement was taken down and disowned. But not quickly enough to avoid sparking controversy. More senior Russian officials denied that any transfer had occurred. However, the FSB made it worse by issuing a statement saying that the lake had been divided between the two countries earlier. That of course implied that any change in the waterline would change the border. Kazakhstan\\'s embassy in Moscow insisted that there had been no change in the border, but then Russia\\'s natural resources minister Sergey Donskoy said that everything would go back to normal when the lake fills up with new rain water, again implying but not saying that the border had somehow been shifted. Russia and Kazakhstan have been working on the demarcation of their border since 2005, and Russians are sensitive to any \\\\\"gift\\\\\" of Russian land to anyone, especially after Moscow ceded several hundred hectares to China a few years ago. But the present case highlights something that few recognize. Unlike most countries, Russia in many cases still defines its borders external and internal not by designating lines from one point defined by latitude and longitude to another point similarly defined but rather in terms of named objects and their size, thus opening the way to disputes if the size of a body of water shifts. Over the last two decades, Moscow has moved from this traditional way to the more internationally accepted one; but people who live along borders often still think in terms of mountains, lakes or rivers rather than latitude and longitude. That appears to be what has happened in this case. But post-Soviet borders remain so sensitive to Russians for other reasons as well, including the unhappiness of many of them with the demise of the USSR and the rise of real borders where there were once unimportant administrative ones that any such report can be counted on to generate controversy. Indeed, as one Russian politician, Dmitry Gudkov, put it on his Facebook page, \\\\\"Crimea is ours but Novosibirsk already isn\\'t so much. Lake Sladkoye had been in Russia but now it has become part of Kazakhstan,\\\\\" leading him to ask why there isn\\'t even more anger in Moscow about this (facebook.com\\\\/dgudkov\\\\/posts\\\\/1647452328629534).\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: 99.7 Percent of Taymyr People Say Life \\'Unbearable\\' Since Amalgamation with Krasnoyarsk Kray\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 17 - Life has become \\\\\"unbearable\\\\\" for the residents of the former Dolgano-Nenets Autonomous District, a poll of residents finds; and 1197 of 1200 of them have appealed to Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders to adopt a law that will allow them to reverse that 2005 action. Their request for a referendum on this point has been turned down twice by the Krasnoyarsk authorities; they are now in the process of making a third such request; but because they do not expect a positive answer, they are appealing to Moscow for a new law that will give them that right (svoboda.org\\\\/a\\\\/28679409.html). Dolgan and Nenets activists say, and the indigenous population overwhelmingly agrees that \\\\\"after the dissolution of the autonomy\\\\\" in 2005 as part of Vladimir Putin\\'s regional amalgamation drive, \\\\\"life in the Taymyr became unbearable: the quality of state services declined, as did the state of roads and transport, medicine and education.\\\\\" Twelve years ago, the residents voted 70 percent in favor of amalgamation but only because they were promised that their lives would become better. The reverse has happened, and the people there are angry. Indeed, they have been among the most prominent critics of Putin\\'s program since the outset. (On that and for background, see windowoneurasia.blogspot.com\\\\/2010\\\\/07\\\\/window-on-eurasia-amalgamated-minority.html, windowoneurasia.blogspot.com\\\\/2008\\\\/11\\\\/window-on-eurasia-putin-policies.html, windowoneurasia.blogspot.com\\\\/2009\\\\/10\\\\/window-on-eurasia-non-russian-units-in.html, windowoneurasia.blogspot.com\\\\/2011\\\\/03\\\\/window-on-eurasia-national-districts-of.html,windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com\\\\/2013\\\\/06\\\\/window-on-eurasia-non-russian-regions.html, windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com\\\\/2015\\\\/06\\\\/another-partial-retreat-from-putins.html, windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com\\\\/2017\\\\/07\\\\/putins-regional-amalgamation-program.html and windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com\\\\/2017\\\\/05\\\\/northern-peoples-seek-to-reverse-putins.html.) The appeal by the Taymyr activists is almost certainly going to be ignored by Moscow and turned down by Krasnoyarsk. After all, regional amalgamation is one of Putin\\'s signature programs. But the new poll showing almost universal unhappiness with that program in the Taymyr will have three important consequences: First, it will further radicalize opinion in the Taymyr, many of whose residents have protested and been repressed in various ways for more than a decade. Second, it will encourage dissent in the five other autonomous oblasts that Putin has succeeded in folding into larger and predominantly ethnic Russian federation subjects. These include the Evenk AO which was also folded into Krasnoyarsk kray, the Ust-Orda Buryat AO that was included within Irkutsk oblast, the Komi-Permyak AO which was combined with Perm oblast to form Perm kray, the Agin Buryat AO which was combined with China oblast to form the Transbaikal kray, and the Koryak AO which was linked to Kamchatka oblast which also became a kray. But third - and this is by far the most important result - it will send a powerful message to Russians as well as non-Russians within the Russian Federation that they are not alone if they find Putin policies objectionable and that by itself may encourage ever more of them to speak out in opposition to the Kremlin leader.\\\\n\\\\nWindow on Eurasia -- New Series: \\'There was Always Toilet Paper in the Soviet Union but Only for the Privileged\\'\\\\n\\\\nPaul Goble Staunton, August 17 - Many foreigners and indeed many Russians believe to this day that there was no toilet paper in the USSR until sometime near the end of that state, but in fact, as a debate that has broken out on the Internet suggests, \\\\\"there was always toilet paper in the Soviet Union but only for the privileged.\\\\\" Novyye izvestiya reports on this debate today, picking up on an earlier article on TheQuestion.ru (newizv.ru\\\\/news\\\\/society\\\\/17-08-2017\\\\/tualetnaya-bumaga-v-sssr-byla-vsegda-no-tolko-dlya-izbrannyh-14f4dbee-b2d2-4791-8bd0-7afe8716611c and thequestion.ru\\\\/questions\\\\/49696\\\\/eto-pravda-chto-v-sssr-tualetnaya-bumaga-poyavilas-tolko-v-1969-godu). Asked by The Question whether it is true that \\\\\"in the USSR, toilet paper appeared only in 1969?\\\\\" the q-and-a portal reproduced some of the answers it received: \\\\u00b7 A Russian student too young to have had direct experience wrote in that \\\\\"the production of toilet paper in the USSR began only in 1968\\\\\" at a plan in Leningrad oblast which made use of two English machines. Its production initially attracted \\\\\"zero interest\\\\\" from Soviet consumers because they \\\\\"simply didn\\'t know how it was supposed to be used.\\\\\" And \\\\\"only after a massive ad campaign\\\\\" did purchases take off and turn toilet paper in the USSR into a \\\\\"deficit\\\\\" good for which people stood in lines for hours. \\\\u00b7 Another visitor the site, Ksyusha Krapiva, 46, confirmed this, but she said that during her childhood, newspapers continued to be used because there was no toilet paper in the restrooms of Soviet schools. \\\\u00b7 A third visitor, Vladislav Shikhov, said that while it was true that toilet paper wasn\\'t available in many places, it had always been produced. According to him, it was listed in a 1956 list of products Soviet firms were manufacturing. It was thus available to some Soviet citizens even if it wasn\\'t to most. \\\\u00b7 And a fourth visitor, journalist Aleksandr Budris, suggested that toilet paper production had an even longer history. He noted at that a Lithuanian factory had begun producing toilet paper in 1923. But as the portal\\'s editors pointed out, Lithuania wasn\\'t part of the Soviet Union then.\\\\n\\\\nPutin\\'s Russia rehabilitates Stalin, prosecutes Last Address Activist for Plaque to Victim of the Terror - To Inform is to Influence\\\\n\\\\n18.08.2017 | Halya Coynash In yet another move in Russia to silence those telling the truth about the Great Terror and Stalinism in general, Dmitry Kozlov has been fined for erecting a Last Address plaque, part of the civic initiative honouring the memory of individual victims of the Terror.

A year ago the Republic told about important rearrangements in special services. What has changed since then? Journalist Ilya Rozhdestvensky lists four most important stories of the last year and the main characters. To Rosneft and back Those who follow the case of Alexei Ulyukayev should have heard about Oleg Feoktistov , whose role in the most high-profile criminal trial of the last year remains to be clarified. Coming from the FSB, Feoktistov came to the post of head of security and vice president of Rosneft in September last year. And in November, Ulyukayev was detained with $ 2 million directly on leaving the office of the oil company. Already in March 2017 it became known that Feoktistov left Rosneft and, as the head of the company Igor Sechin put it, \\\\\"returned to the service.\\\\\" Why Feoktistov spent only six months on his new job is unknown, but a high-ranking Republican interlocutor in the FSB explains the logic of events like this: in the pre-election year, the president did not want to consolidate the positions of an already powerful company at the expense of one of the most powerful security forces; According to the source, this decision was also due to \\\\\"exceptional activity\\\\\" in the case of Ulyukaev. As noted by The Bell, in counterintelligence, that is, at the old place of work, Feoktistov did not find a place. This is also confirmed by two sources of the Republic in the FSB. One of them points out that the general was too \\\\\"exposed\\\\\" in the media to continue working in the FSB. A source close to the leadership of the FSB says: \\\\\"Now Feoktistov is listed in the FSB reserve and is waiting for a pension.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nJailed Russian Ex-Intelligence Officer Kvachkov Receives Additional Sentence\\\\n\\\\nA former Russian intelligence officer who is serving a prison term for an alleged attempt to overthrow the government, has been handed an additional prison term for incitement to hatred.

There is no other oil there and it is unlikely to appear, that is why we need to align their receiving our oil with the requirement of using our infrastructure,\\\\\" as said by President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on transport infrastructure development for the northwest Russia which was held on Wednesday, August 16th, in Kaliningrad, as reported by RIA Novosti. Belarus has two oil refineries in Mozyr and Novopolotsk. Russia agreed to supply 24 million tons of oil to Belarus in 2017 on duty-free conditions, 18 million of which go directly to the refineries. However, oil products from these plants are exported through Baltic ports. Belarus does not use Russian ports at all, despite the fact that RZD (JSC Russian Railways) has provided the maximum 50% discount for transportation. \\\\\"We are negotiating, Belarus says that they have long-term contracts for transport with these companies, but we are trying to build a dialogue with them,\\\\\" Oleg Belozyorov, President of RZD, told Putin during the meeting. The main exporter of petroleum products in Belarus is the state-owned Belarusian Oil Company (BNK). It has not disclosed its export volumes through the Baltic ports. However, based on data reported by the business publication Belrynok, the volume of export of petroleum products through Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania is about 10 million tons per year. The same number was confirmed to RBC news agency by one of the transporters engaged in deliveries throughout the Baltics. According to the RBC\\'s source in the Ministry of Energy, Belarus can export up to 6 million tons via Russian ports. Three terminals in northwest Russia can take in Belarusian oil products. They are Ust-Luga Oil, controlled by businessman Andrei Bokarev, St. Petersburg Oil Terminal, and the LUKOIL terminal in Vysotsk. All of them specialize in the transport of petroleum products and own railway lines. Their representatives have not yet responded to RBC news agency\\'s requests, but RBC\\'s source in the Ministry of Energy said that the tariffs for oil shipment through Russian ports were \\\\\"affordable\\\\\". However, he notes that the Baltic States are dropping the transportation prices in order to compensate for the deflated volume of Russian cargo. A representative of the Ministry of Energy told RBC Group that the agency had not yet been instructed to make the provision of Russian oil to Belarus on the condition that Belarusian oil products are transported through Russian ports. Sources in Rosneft and LUKOIL, the main suppliers of oil to Belarus, also said that they did not receive any instructions on this matter and did not participate in any negotiations on this topic. Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev told RBC that the company supports this proposal. At the same time, the source in Rosneft adds that duty-free oil supplies to Belarus are beneficial first of all to this country, and companies perform them only on the government\\'s instructions. Russia purposefully pursues a policy of reorientation of export cargoes, which are transported through ports of neighboring countries to its own ports. As a result, the shipment of Russian cargo through the Baltic ports in 2016 fell by 20%, to 42.5 million tons, according to the information of Association of Sea Commercial Ports, as reported by TASS. Transport of oil and oil products decreased by 49.3%, to 10.08 million tons, and coal volume by 13.3%, to 16.36 million tons. The president of Transneft, Nikolay Tokarev, said at the end of 2016 that the company would cease to deliver oil products to Latvia by 2018. The pipeline monopoly supplies oil products through the pipeline to the port of Ventspils or through the pipeline to Bryansk and then by rail. Now, Transneft is completing the Sever project aimed to increase the capacity of the oil products pipeline to the port of Primorsk from 15 million to 25 million tons per year.\\\\n\\\\nTransnistria \\\\/ Moldova Reports\\\\n\\\\nRomania fears propaganda from Russian-owned Moldovan channel -- The Calvert Journal\\\\n\\\\nThe latest from Romania\\'s ongoing deliberation over a Russian-owned Moldovan TV station\\'s request for a permit to broadcast in Romania\\\\n\\\\nMoldovan girls trafficked to Sweden: Romanian citizen detained\\\\n\\\\nMoldovan girls trafficked to Sweden: Romanian citizen detained\\\\n\\\\nMoldova\\'s LGBT Community Faces a Russia-Inspired Media Crackdown\\\\n\\\\nMoldova&amp;rsquo;s LGBT community has come under increasing fire from a campaign to restrict their use of media and information platforms to mobilize for their rights.

Dana Rohrabacher that Russia was not behind leaks of emails during last year\\'s presidential election campaign that damaged Hillary Clinton\\'s candidacy and exposed the inner workings of the Democratic National Committee. The California congressman spent some three hours with the Australian-born fugitive, now living under the protection of the Ecuadorian embassy in the British capital. Assange\\'s claim contradicts the widely accepted assessment of the U.S. intelligence community that the thousands of leaked emails, which indicated the Democratic National Committee rigged the nomination process against Sen. Bernie Sanders in favor of Clinton, were the result of hacking by the Russian government or persons connected to the Kremlin. Assange, said Rohrabacher, \\\\\"emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved in the hacking or disclosure of those emails.\\\\\" Rohrabacher, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats, is the only U.S. congressman to have visited the controversial figure.

On August 16, the Prosecutor General\\'s Office of Ukraine (GPU) clarified that it is investigating the disclosure of information from a pretrial investigation by the NABU, not interference in US elections.

The disclosed photocopy of part of the document gives the story of the case opened on August 2: \\\\\"According to the appeal of Ukrainian MP Derkach A.L. [unaffiliated MP Andrei Derkach] Ukrainian law enforcement officials disclosed pretrial investigation information by revealing to the media fragments of records made on lists in the Party of Regions\\' \\'black ledger\\' on the name of Donald Trump\\'s campaign manager Paul Manafort. The Ukrainian information discredits the person, degrades his honor and dignity by creating a public impression of illegal interference in the US presidential elections\\\\\". In May 2016, former first deputy SBU (Security Service of Ukraine) head Viktor Trepak gave the NBU documents relating to the Party of Regions\\' \\\\\"black ledger\\\\\". According to him, these documents are evidence of the Party of Regions\\' illegal cash payments to Ukrainian officials and politicians, as well as to Manafort, who later became the head of Trump\\'s electoral campaign. The New York Times subsequently released an article on Manafort\\'s work in Ukraine, after which he resigned from his position as Trump\\'s campaign manager.

Three people were arrested, but a manhunt was underway for the driver of the van used in Thursday\\'s Barcelona attack, which killed 13 people and injured 100 others. The Islamic State group quickly claimed responsibility.\\\\n\\\\nAmid heavy security, Barcelona tried to move forward Friday, with its iconic Las Ramblas promenade quietly reopening to the public and King Felipe VI and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy joining thousands of residents and visitors in observing a minute of silence in the city\\'s main square.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I am not afraid! I am not afraid!\\\\\" the crowd chanted in Catalan amid applause.\\\\n\\\\nBut the dual attacks unnerved a country that hasn\\'t seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 192 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid\\'s commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted some 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\\\\n\\\\nAuthorities were still reeling from the Barcelona attack when police in the popular seaside town of Cambrils, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the south, fatally shot five people near the town\\'s boardwalk who had plowed into a group of tourists and locals with their blue Audi 3. Catalonia\\'s interior minister, Joaquim Forn, told Onda Cero radio they were wearing fake bomb belts.\\\\n\\\\nOne woman died Friday from her injuries, Catalan police said on Twitter. Five others were injured.\\\\n\\\\nCambrils Mayor Cami Mendoza said the town had taken precautions after the Barcelona attack, but that the suspects had centered their assault on the narrow path to the boardwalk, which is usually packed with locals and tourists late into the evening.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We were on a terrace, like many others,\\\\\" said bystander Jose Antonio Saez. \\\\\"We heard the crash and intense gun shots, then the dead bodies on the floor, shot by the police. They had what looked like explosive belts on.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOthers described scenes of panic, and found safety inside bars and restaurants until police had secured the area.\\\\n\\\\nLocal resident Markel Artabe said he was heading to the seafront to get an ice cream when he heard the shots.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We began to run. We saw one person lying on the pavement with a shot in his head, then 20 to 30 meters farther on we saw two more people, who must have been terrorists as they had explosive belts around them. We were worried so we hid.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe Cambrils attack came soon after a white van veered onto Barcelona\\'s picturesque Las Ramblas promenade and mowed down pedestrians, zig-zagging down the strip packed with locals and tourists from around the world. Catalonian authorities tweeted that the dead and injured in the two attacks were people of 34 different nationalities.\\\\n\\\\nForn told local radio RAC1 the Cambrils attack \\\\\"follows the same trail. There is a connection.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHe told Onda Cero that the Cambrils and Barcelona attacks were being investigated together, as well as a Wednesday night explosion in the town of Alcanar in which one person was killed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nForn also suggested a possible connection to an incident Thursday in which the driver of a Ford Focus plowed through a police checkpoint leaving Barelona after the attack, injuring two police officers. The driver was killed. Police initially said there was no connection to the Barcelona carnage, but Forn said an investigation was under way.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"There is a possibility (of a connection), but it is not confirmed,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nThe Barcelona attack at the peak of Spain\\'s tourist season left victims sprawled across the street, spattered with blood and writhing in pain from broken limbs. Others were ushered inside shops by officers with their guns drawn or fled in panic, screaming and carrying young children in their arms.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It was clearly a terror attack, intended to kill as many people as possible,\\\\\" Josep Lluis Trapero, a senior police official for Spain\\'s Catalonia region told reporters late Thursday.\\\\n\\\\nThe Islamic State group said in a statement on its Aamaq news agency that the attack was carried out by \\\\\"soldiers of the Islamic State\\\\\" in response to the extremist group\\'s calls for followers to target countries participating in the coalition trying to drive it from Syria and Iraq.\\\\n\\\\nA third Barcelona suspect was arrested Friday in the northern town of Ripoll, where one of the two detained on Thursday had also been nabbed and where the investigation appeared to be focusing Friday. The third arrest was made in Alcanar, where the gas explosion in a house was being investigated.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"There could be more people in Ripoll connected to the group,\\\\\" Forn told TV3 television, adding that police were focusing their investigation on identifying the five dead in Cambrils as well as the driver of the Barcelona van.\\\\n\\\\nSpanish public broadcaster RTVE and other news outlets named one of the detained in the Barcelona attack as Driss Oukabir, a French citizen of Moroccan origin. RTVE reported that Oukabir went to police in Ripoll to report that his identity documents had been stolen. Various Spanish media said the IDs with his name were found in the attack van and that he claimed his brother might have stolen them.\\\\n\\\\nCiting police sources, Spain\\'s RTVE as well as El Pais and TV3 identified the brother, Moussa Oukabir, as the suspected driver of the van. Forn declined to comment on questions about him Friday, citing the ongoing investigation.\\\\n\\\\nMedia outlets ran photographs of Driss Oukabir they said police had issued to identify one of the suspects. The regional police told The Associated Press that they had not distributed the photograph. They refused to say if he was one of the two detained.\\\\n\\\\nThe driver, however, remained at large.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We don\\'t know if the driver is still in Barcelona or not, or what direction he fled in,\\\\\" Forn, the Catalan interior minister, told SER Radio. \\\\\"We had local police on the scene, but we were unable to shoot him, as the Ramblas were packed with people.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the killings a \\\\\"savage terrorist attack\\\\\" and said Spaniards \\\\\"are not just united in mourning, but especially in the firm determination to beat those who want to rob us of our values and our way of life.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAfter the afternoon attack, Las Ramblas went into lockdown. Swarms of officers brandishing hand guns and automatic weapons launched a manhunt in the downtown district, ordering stores and cafes and public transport to shut down.\\\\n\\\\nBy Friday morning, the promenade had reopened to the public, albeit under heavy surveillance and an unusual quiet.\\\\n\\\\nNewsstands were open selling papers and souvenirs near Plaza de Catalunya, but the iconic flower shops that line the promenade remained shuttered. Vendors who typically sell counterfeit sneakers and soccer jerseys displayed on white sheets were nowhere to be found.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We all feel fine, right?\\\\\" said Tara Lanza, a New York tourist who arrived in Barcelona even after hearing of the attack.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It\\'s sad,\\\\\" John Lanza said, as the family stood outside the gated La Boqueria market. \\\\\"You can tell it\\'s obviously quieter than it usually is, but I think people are trying to get on with their lives.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAt noon Friday, a minute of silence honoring the victims was observed at the Placa Catalunya, near the top of the Ramblas where the van attack started. Rajoy declared three days of national mourning.\\\\n\\\\nSince the Madrid train bombings, the only deadly attacks had been bombings claimed by the Basque separatist group ETA that killed five people over the past decade.

But Ban said he stood by the report, which said the U.N. verified a total of 1,953 youngsters killed and injured in Yemen in 2015 -- a six-fold increase compared with 2014.\\\\n\\\\n___\\\\n\\\\nTillerson, Mattis insist military options remain for NKorea\\\\n\\\\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- America\\'s diplomatic and defense chiefs sought Thursday to reinforce the threat of possible U.S. military action against North Korea after President Donald Trump\\'s top strategist essentially called the commander-in-chief\\'s warnings a bluff.\\\\n\\\\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson stressed after security talks with close ally Japan that the U.S. seeks a peaceful solution to the standoff over North Korea\\'s nuclear weapons program. But he said a U.S.-led campaign of economic pressure and diplomacy needs to be backed by potential military consequences.\\\\n\\\\nWashington is \\\\\"prepared militarily\\\\\" to respond, if necessary, he said.\\\\n\\\\nTillerson spoke after he and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis held annual security talks with Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera and Foreign Minister Taro Kono at the State Department. Much of the discussion focused on North Korea, which also poses a threat to Japan.\\\\n\\\\nNeither Tillerson nor Mattis responded directly to strategist Steve Bannon\\'s argument in an interview published Wednesday that there\\'s no military solution to the North Korean threat.

Robert E. Lee. All those factors made this community a symbolically powerful backdrop for what\\'s considered the largest white nationalist gathering in at least a decade.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"We are a progressive, tolerant city. We are also a Southern city,\\\\\" Mayor Mike Signer said. About a year and a half ago, Charlottesville \\\\\"decided to launch on the difficult but essential work of finally telling the truth about race. That made us a target for tons of people who don\\'t want to change the narrative.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOn the eve of Saturday\\'s rally, hundreds of white men marched through the University of Virginia campus, holding torches and chanting racist and anti-Semitic slogans. The next morning, many looked like they were dressed for war as they made their way to Emancipation Park.\\\\n\\\\nThey clashed with counter-protesters in a stunning display of violence before authorities forced the crowd to disperse. Later, a car plowed into a crowd of demonstrators, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others.\",\"url\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/www.kansascity.com\\\\/news\\\\/nation-world\\\\/article167677977.html\"},\"70\":{\"source\":\"Honolulu Star-Advertiser\",\"text\":\"The main thoroughfare in Kiev, Ukraine in June.

Last winter, he suddenly went dark entirely.\\\\n\\\\nProfexer\\'s posts, already accessible only to a small band of fellow hackers and cybercriminals looking for software tips, blinked out in January -- just days after U.S. intelligence agencies publicly identified a program he had written as one tool used in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee.\\\\n\\\\nBut while Profexer\\'s online persona vanished, a flesh-and-blood person has emerged: a fearful man who Ukrainian police said turned himself in early this year and has now become a witness for the FBI.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I don\\'t know what will happen,\\\\\" he wrote in one of his last messages posted on a restricted-access website before going to the police. \\\\\"It won\\'t be pleasant.

It is this group, which U.S. intelligence agencies believe is operated by Russian military intelligence, that has been blamed, along with a second Russian outfit known as Cozy Bear, for the DNC intrusion.\\\\n\\\\nRather than training, arming and deploying hackers to carry out a specific mission like just another military unit, Fancy Bear and its twin Cozy Bear have operated more as centers for organization and financing; much of the hard work like coding is outsourced to private and often crime-tainted vendors.\\\\n\\\\nRussia\\'s testing ground\\\\n\\\\nIn more than a decade of tracking suspected Russian-directed cyberattacks against a host of targets in the West and in former Soviet territories -- NATO, electrical grids, research groups, journalists critical of Russia and political parties, to name a few -- security services around the world have identified only a handful of people who are directly involved in either carrying out such attacks or providing the cyberweapons that were used.\\\\n\\\\nThis absence of reliable witnesses has left ample room for President Donald Trump and others to raise doubts about whether Russia really was involved in the DNC hack.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"There is not now and never has been a single piece of technical evidence produced that connects the malware used in the DNC attack to the GRU, FSB or any agency of the Russian government,\\\\\" said Jeffrey Carr, the author of a book on cyberwarfare. The GRU is Russia\\'s military intelligence agency, and the FSB its federal security service.\\\\n\\\\nU.S. intelligence agencies, however, have been unequivocal in pointing a finger at Russia.\\\\n\\\\nSeeking a path out of this fog, cybersecurity researchers and Western law enforcement officers have turned to Ukraine, a country that Russia has used for years as a laboratory for a range of politicized operations that later cropped up elsewhere, including electoral hacking in the U.S.\\\\n\\\\nIn several instances, certain types of computer intrusions, like the use of malware to knock out crucial infrastructure or to pilfer e-mail messages later released to tilt public opinion, occurred in Ukraine first. Only later were the same techniques used in Western Europe and the U.S.\\\\n\\\\nSo, not surprisingly, those studying cyberwar in Ukraine are now turning up clues in the investigation of the DNC hack, including the discovery of a rare witness.\\\\n\\\\nSecurity experts were initially left scratching their heads when the Department of Homeland Security on Dec. 29 released technical evidence of Russian hacking that seemed to point not to Russia, but rather to Ukraine.\\\\n\\\\nIn this initial report, the department released only one sample of malware said to be an indicator of Russian state-sponsored hacking, though outside experts said a variety of malicious programs were used in Russian electoral hacking.\\\\n\\\\nThe sample pointed to a malware program, called the PAS web shell, a hacking tool advertised on Russian-language Dark Web forums and used by cybercriminals throughout the former Soviet Union. The author, Profexer, is a well-regarded technical expert among hackers, spoken about with awe and respect in Kiev.\\\\n\\\\nHe had made it available to download, free, from a website that asked only for donations, ranging from $3 to $250. The real money was made by selling customized versions and by guiding his hacker clients in its effective use. It remains unclear how extensively he interacted with the Russian hacking team.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the Department of Homeland Security identified his creation, he quickly shut down his website and posted on a closed forum for hackers, called Exploit, that \\\\\"I\\'m not interested in excessive attention to me personally.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSoon, a hint of panic appeared, and he posted a note saying that, six days on, he was still alive.\\\\n\\\\nAnother hacker, with the nickname Zloi Santa, or Bad Santa, suggested that the Americans would certainly find him, and place him under arrest, perhaps during a layover at an airport.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It could be, or it could not be, it depends only on politics,\\\\\" Profexer responded. \\\\\"If U.S. law enforcement wants to take me down, they will not wait for me in some country\\'s airport. Relations between our countries are so tight I would be arrested in my kitchen, at the first request.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSerhiy Demediuk, chief of the Ukrainian Cyber Police, said in an interview that Profexer went to authorities himself. As the cooperation began, Profexer went dark on hacker forums. He last posted online on Jan. 9. Demediuk said he had made the witness available to the FBI, which has posted a full-time cybersecurity expert in Kiev as one of four bureau agents stationed at the U.S. Embassy there. The FBI declined to comment.\\\\n\\\\nProfexer was not arrested because his activities fell in a legal gray zone, as an author but not a user of malware, the Ukrainian police say. But he did know the users, at least by their online handles. \\\\\"He told us he didn\\'t create it to be used in the way it was,\\\\\" Demediuk said.\\\\n\\\\nA member of Ukraine\\'s parliament with close ties to the security services, Anton Gerashchenko, said that the interaction was online or by phone and that the Ukrainian programmer had been paid to write customized malware without knowing its purpose, only later learning it was used in the DNC hack.\\\\n\\\\nGerashchenko described the author only in broad strokes, to protect his safety, as a young man from a provincial Ukrainian city. He confirmed that the author turned himself in to the police and was cooperating as a witness in the DNC investigation. \\\\\"He was a freelancer and now he is a valuable witness,\\\\\" Gerashchenko said.\\\\n\\\\nA bear\\'s lair\\\\n\\\\nWhile it is not known what Profexer has told Ukrainian investigators and the FBI about Russia\\'s hacking efforts, evidence emanating from Ukraine has again provided some of the clearest pictures yet about Fancy Bear, or Advanced Persistent Threat 28, which is run by the GRU.\\\\n\\\\nFancy Bear has been identified mostly by what it does, not by who does it. One of its recurring features has been the theft of e-mails and its close collaboration with the Russian state news media.\\\\n\\\\nTracking the bear to its lair, however, has so far proved impossible, not least because many experts believe that no such single place exists.\\\\n\\\\nEven for a sophisticated tech company like Microsoft, singling out individuals in the digital miasma has proved just about impossible. To curtail the damage to clients\\' operating systems, the company filed a complaint against Fancy Bear last year with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia but found itself boxing with shadows.\\\\n\\\\nAs Microsoft lawyers reported to the court, \\\\\"because defendants used fake contact information, anonymous Bitcoin and prepaid credit cards and false identities, and sophisticated technical means to conceal their identities, when setting up and using the relevant internet domains, defendants\\' true identities remain unknown.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNevertheless, Ukrainian officials, though wary of upsetting the Trump administration, have been quietly cooperating with U.S. investigators to try to figure out who stands behind all the disguises.\\\\n\\\\nIncluded in this sharing of information were copies of the server hard drives of Ukraine\\'s Central Election Commission, which were targeted during a presidential election in May 2014. That the FBI had obtained evidence of this earlier, Russian-linked electoral hack has not been previously reported.\\\\n\\\\nTraces of the same malicious code, this time a program called Sofacy, were seen in the 2014 attack in Ukraine and later in the DNC intrusion in the U.S.\\\\n\\\\nIntriguingly, in the cyberattack during the Ukrainian election, what appears to have been a bungle by Channel 1, a Russian state television station, inadvertently implicated government authorities in Moscow.\\\\n\\\\nHackers had loaded onto a Ukrainian election commission server a graphic mimicking the page for displaying results. This phony page showed a shocker of an outcome: an election win for a fiercely anti-Russian, ultraright candidate, Dmytro Yarosh. Yarosh in reality received less than 1 percent of the vote.\\\\n\\\\nThe false result would have played into a Russian propaganda narrative that Ukraine today is ruled by hard-right, even fascist, figures.\\\\n\\\\nThe fake image was programmed to display when polls closed, at 8 p.m., but a Ukrainian cybersecurity company, InfoSafe, discovered it just minutes earlier and unplugged the server.\\\\n\\\\nState television in Russia nevertheless reported that Yarosh had won and broadcast the fake graphic, citing the election commission\\'s website, even though the image had never appeared there. The hacker had clearly provided Channel 1 with the same image in advance, but the reporters had failed to check that the hack actually worked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"For me, this is an obvious link between the hackers and Russian officials,\\\\\" said Victor Zhora, director of InfoSafe, the cybersecurity company that first found the fake graphic.\\\\n\\\\nA Ukrainian government researcher who studied the hack, Nikolai Koval, published his findings in a 2015 book, \\\\\"Cyberwar in Perspective,\\\\\" and identified the Sofacy malware on the server.\\\\n\\\\nThe mirror of the hard drive went to the FBI, which had this forensic sample when the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike identified the same malware two years later, on the DNC servers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It was the first strike,\\\\\" Zhora said of the earlier hack of Ukraine\\'s electoral computers. Ukraine\\'s Cyber Police have also provided the FBI with copies of server hard drives showing the possible origins of some phishing e-mails targeting the Democratic Party during the election.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2016, two years after the election hack in Ukraine, hackers using some of the same techniques plundered the e-mail system of the World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, which had accused Russian athletes of systematic drug use.\\\\n\\\\nThat raid, too, seems to have been closely coordinated with Russian state television, which began airing well-prepared reports about WADA\\'s hacked e-mails just minutes after they were made public. The e-mails appeared on a website that announced that WADA had been hacked by a group calling itself the \\\\\"Fancy Bears\\' Hack Team.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIt was the first time Fancy Bear had broken cover.\\\\n\\\\nFancy Bear remains extraordinarily elusive, however. To throw investigators off its scent, the group has undergone various makeovers, restocking its arsenal of malware and sometimes hiding under different guises. One of its alter egos, cyberexperts believe, is Cyber Berkut, an outfit supposedly set up in Ukraine by supporters of the country\\'s pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was ousted in 2014.\\\\n\\\\nAfter lying dormant for many months, Cyber Berkut jumped back into action this summer just as multiple investigations in Washington into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow shifted into high gear. Cyber Berkut released stolen e-mails that it and Russian state news media said had exposed the real story: Hillary Clinton had colluded with Ukraine.\",\"url\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/www.startribune.com\\\\/ukraine-malware-expert-may-blow-whistle-on-russian-hacking\\\\/440791753\\\\/\"},\"73\":{\"source\":\"\\\\u0633\\\\u0627\\\\u06cc\\\\u062a \\\\u062e\\\\u0628\\\\u0631\\\\u06cc \\\\u062a\\\\u062d\\\\u0644\\\\u06cc\\\\u0644\\\\u06cc \\\\u062a\\\\u0627\\\\u0628\\\\u0646\\\\u0627\\\\u0643|\\\\u0627\\\\u062e\\\\u0628\\\\u0627\\\\u0631 \\\\u0627\\\\u06cc\\\\u0631\\\\u0627\\\\u0646 \\\\u0648 \\\\u062c\\\\u0647\\\\u0627\\\\u0646|TABNAK\",\"text\":\"The hacker, known only by his online alias \\\\\"Profexer,\\\\\" kept a low profile.

One of its recurring features has been the theft of emails and its close collaboration with the Russian state news media.\\\\n\\\\nTracking the bear to its lair, however, has so far proved impossible, not least because many experts believe that no such single place exists.\\\\n\\\\nEven for a sophisticated tech company like Microsoft, singling out individuals in the digital miasma has proved just about impossible. To curtail the damage to clients\\' operating systems, the company filed a complaint against Fancy Bear last year with the United States District Court for eastern Virginia but found itself boxing with shadows.\\\\n\\\\nAs Microsoft lawyers reported to the court, \\\\\"because defendants used fake contact information, anonymous Bitcoin and prepaid credit cards and false identities, and sophisticated technical means to conceal their identities, when setting up and using the relevant internet domains, defendants\\' true identities remain unknown.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNevertheless, Ukrainian officials, though wary of upsetting the Trump administration, have been quietly cooperating with American investigators to try to figure out who stands behind all the disguises.\\\\n\\\\nIncluded in this sharing of information were copies of the server hard drives of Ukraine\\'s Central Election Commission, which were targeted during a presidential election in May 2014. That the F.B.I. had obtained evidence of this earlier, Russian-linked electoral hack has not been previously reported.\\\\n\\\\nTraces of the same malicious code, this time a program called Sofacy, were seen in the 2014 attack in Ukraine and later in the D.N.C. intrusion in the United States.\\\\n\\\\nIntriguingly, in the cyberattack during the Ukrainian election, what appears to have been a bungle by Channel 1, a Russian state television station, inadvertently implicated the government authorities in Moscow.\\\\n\\\\nHackers had loaded onto a Ukrainian election commission server a graphic mimicking the page for displaying results. This phony page showed a shocker of an outcome: an election win for a fiercely anti-Russian, ultraright candidate, Dmytro Yarosh. Mr. Yarosh in reality received less than 1 percent of the vote.\\\\n\\\\nThe false result would have played into a Russian propaganda narrative that Ukraine today is ruled by hard-right, even fascist, figures.\\\\n\\\\nThe fake image was programmed to display when polls closed, at 8 p.m., but a Ukrainian cybersecurity company, InfoSafe, discovered it just minutes earlier and unplugged the server.\\\\n\\\\nState television in Russia nevertheless reported that Mr. Yarosh had won and broadcast the fake graphic, citing the election commission\\'s website, even though the image had never appeared there. The hacker had clearly provided Channel 1 with the same image in advance, but the reporters had failed to check that the hack actually worked.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"For me, this is an obvious link between the hackers and Russian officials,\\\\\" said Victor Zhora, director of InfoSafe, the cybersecurity company that first found the fake graphic.\\\\n\\\\nA Ukrainian government researcher who studied the hack, Nikolai Koval, published his findings in a 2015 book, \\\\\"Cyberwar in Perspective,\\\\\" and identified the Sofacy malware on the server.\\\\n\\\\nThe mirror of the hard drive went to the F.B.I., which had this forensic sample when the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike identified the same malware two years later, on the D.N.C. servers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It was the first strike,\\\\\" Mr. Zhora said of the earlier hack of Ukraine\\'s electoral computers. Ukraine\\'s Cyber Police have also provided the F.B.I. with copies of server hard drives showing the possible origins of some phishing emails targeting the Democratic Party during the election.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2016, two years after the election hack in Ukraine, hackers using some of the same techniques plundered the email system of the World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, which had accused Russian athletes of systematic drug use.\\\\n\\\\nThat raid, too, seems to have been closely coordinated with Russian state television, which began airing well-prepared reports about WADA\\'s hacked emails just minutes after they were made public. The emails appeared on a website that announced that WADA had been hacked by a group calling itself the \\\\\"Fancy Bears\\' Hack Team.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIt was the first time Fancy Bear had broken cover.\\\\n\\\\nFancy Bear remains extraordinarily elusive, however. To throw investigators off its scent, the group has undergone various makeovers, restocking its arsenal of malware and sometimes hiding under different guises. One of its alter egos, cyberexperts believe, is Cyber Berkut, an outfit supposedly set up in Ukraine by supporters of the country\\'s pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was ousted in 2014.\\\\n\\\\nAfter lying dormant for many months, Cyber Berkut jumped back into action this summer just as multiple investigations in Washington into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow shifted into high gear. Cyber Berkut released stolen emails that it and Russian state news media said had exposed the real story: Hillary Clinton had colluded with Ukraine.\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.nytimes.com\\\\/2017\\\\/08\\\\/16\\\\/world\\\\/europe\\\\/russia-ukraine-malware-hacking-witness.html\"},\"75\":{\"source\":\"Public CIO magazine\",\"text\":\"Gaston Kirby, right, and Juan Minutella leave Kirby\\'s flooded home in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Monday, Sept. 4, 2017, near the Addicks and Barker Reservoirs, in Houston.

Phillip\\\\n\\\\nThe wonky words infrastructure and resilience have circulated widely of late, particularly since Hurricanes Harvey and Irma struck paralyzing, costly blows in two of America\\'s fastest-growing states.\\\\n\\\\nResilience is a property traditionally defined as the ability to bounce back. A host of engineers and urban planners have long warned this trait is sorely lacking in America\\'s brittle infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nMany such experts say the disasters in the sprawling suburban and petro-industrial landscape around Houston and along the crowded coasts of Florida reinforce the urgent idea that resilient infrastructure is needed more than ever, particularly as human-driven climate change helps drive extreme weather.\\\\n\\\\nThe challenge in prompting change -- broadening the classic definition of \\\\\"infrastructure,\\\\\" and investing in initiatives aimed at adapting to a turbulent planet -- is heightened by partisan divisions over climate policy and development.\\\\n\\\\nOf course, there\\'s also the question of money. The country\\'s infrastructure is ailing already. A national civil engineering group has surveyed the nation\\'s bridges, roads, dams, transit systems and more and awarded a string of D or D+ grades since 1998. The same group has estimated that the country will be several trillion dollars short of what\\'s needed to harden and rebuild and modernize our infrastructure over the next decade.\\\\n\\\\nFor fresh or underappreciated ideas, ProPublica reached out to a handful of engineers, economists and policy analysts focused on reducing risk on a fast-changing planet.\\\\n\\\\nAlice Hill, who directed resilience policy for the National Security Council in the Obama administration, said the wider debate over cutting climate-warming emissions may have distracted people from promptly pursuing ways to reduce risks and economic and societal costs from natural disasters.\\\\n\\\\nShe and several other experts said a first step is getting past the old definition of resilience as bouncing back from a hit, which presumes a community needs simply to recover.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I don\\'t think of resilience in the traditional sense, in cutting how long it takes to turn the lights back on,\\\\\" said Brian Bledsoe, the director of the Institute for Resilient Infrastructure Systems at the University of Georgia. \\\\\"Resilience is seizing an opportunity to move into a state of greater adaptability and preparedness -- not just going back to the status quo.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIn thinking about improving the country\\'s infrastructure, and provoking real action, Bledsoe and others say, language matters.\\\\n\\\\nBledsoe, for instance, is exploring new ways to communicate flood risk in words and maps. His institute is testing replacements for the tired language of 1-in-100 or 1-in-500-year floods. A 100-year flood has a 1 in 4 chance of occurring in the 30-year span of a typical home mortgage, he said, adding that\\'s the kind of time scale that gets people\\'s attention.\\\\n\\\\nVisual cues matter, too, he said. On conventional maps, simple lines marking a floodplain boundary often are interpreted as separating safe zones and those at risk, Bledsoe said. But existing models of water flows don\\'t provide the full range of possible outcomes: \\\\\"A 50-year rain can produce a 100-year flood if it falls on a watershed that\\'s already soaked or on snowpack or if it coincides with a storm surge.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The bright line on a map is an illusion,\\\\\" he said, particularly in flat places like Houston, where a slight change in flood waters can result in far more widespread inundation. Risk maps should reflect that uncertainty, and wider threat.\\\\n\\\\nNicholas Pinter, a University of California, Davis, geoscientist who studies flood risk and water management, said that Florida is well-situated to build more wisely after this disaster because it already has a statewide post-disaster redevelopment plan and requires coastal communities to have their own.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s more typical to have short-term recovery plans -- for digging out and getting the lights back on, as 20,000 utility workers are scurrying to do right now.\\\\n\\\\nThe advantage of having an established protocol for redevelopment, he said, is it trims delays.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Draw up plans when the skies are blue and pull them off the shelf,\\\\\" he said of how having rebuilding protocols in place can limit repeating mistakes. \\\\\"That fast response cuts down on the horrible lag time in which people typically rebuild in place.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe rebuilt levee wall that was destroyed during Hurricane Katrina, in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana (Chris Graythen\\\\/Getty Images)\\\\n\\\\nIn a warming climate, scientists see increasing potential for epic deluges like the one that swamped Houston and last year\\'s devastating rains around Baton Rouge, Louisiana. How can the federal government more responsibly manage such environmental threats?\\\\n\\\\nMany people point to the National Flood Insurance Program, which was created to boost financial resilience in flood zones, but has been criticized from just about every political and technical vantage point as too often working to subsidize, instead of mitigate, vulnerability.\\\\n\\\\nAs has happened periodically before, pressure is building on Congress to get serious about fixing the program (a reauthorization deadline was just pushed from this month toward the end of the year).\\\\n\\\\nHow this debate plays out will have an important impact on infrastructure resilience, said Pinter of the University of California, Davis. If incentives remain skewed in favor of dangerous and sprawling development, he said, that just expands where roads, wires, pipelines and other connecting systems have to be built. \\\\\"Public infrastructure is there in service of populations,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nHe also said the lack of federal guidance has led to deeply uneven enforcement of floodplain building at the state level, with enormous disparities around the country resulting in more resilient states, in essence, subsidizing disaster-prone development in others.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Why should California, Wyoming or Utah be paying the price for Houston, Mississippi or Alabama failing to enforce the National Flood Insurance Program? \\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\nBledsoe, at the University of Georgia, said there\\'s no need to wait for big changes in the program to start making progress. He said the National Flood Insurance Program has a longstanding division, the Community Rating System, that could swiftly be expanded, cutting both flood risk and budget-breaking payouts. It\\'s a voluntary program that reduces flood insurance rates for communities that take additional efforts beyond minimum standards to reduce flood damage to insurable property.\\\\n\\\\nDespite the clear benefits, he said, only one municipality, Roseville, California, has achieved the top level of nine rankings and gotten the biggest insurance savings -- 45 percent. Tulsa, Oklahoma, Fort Collins, Colorado, King County, Washington, and Pierce County, Washington, are at the second ranking and get a 40 percent rate cut. Hundreds of other municipalities are at much lower levels of preparedness.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Boosting participation is low-hanging fruit,\\\\\" Bledsoe said.\\\\n\\\\nSome see signs that the recent blitz of hurricanes is reshaping strategies in the Trump White House. President Donald Trump\\'s infrastructure agenda, unveiled on August 15, centered on rescinding Obama-era plans to require consideration of flood risk and climate change in any federal spending for infrastructure or housing and the like. The argument was built around limiting perceived red tape.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the flooding of Houston less than two weeks later, Trump appointees, including Tom Bossert, the president\\'s homeland security adviser, said a new plan was being developed to insure federal money would not increase flood risks.\\\\n\\\\nOn Monday, as Irma weakened over Georgia, Bossert used a White House briefing to offer more hints of an emerging climate resilience policy, while notably avoiding accepting climate change science: \\\\\"What President Trump is committed to is making sure that federal dollars aren\\'t used to rebuild things that will be in harm\\'s way later or that won\\'t be hardened against the future predictable floods that we see. And that has to do with engineering analysis and changing conditions along eroding shorelines but also in inland water and flood-control projects.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nRobert R.M. Verchick, a Loyola University law professor who worked on climate change adaptation policy at the Environmental Protection Agency under Obama, said federal leadership is essential.\\\\n\\\\nIf Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps incorporated future climate conditions, that move would send a ripple effect into real estate and insurance markets, forcing people to pay attention, he said. If the federal government required projected climate conditions to be considered when spending on infrastructure in flood-prone areas, construction practices would change, he added, noting the same pressures would drive chemical plants or other industries to have a wider margin of safety.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"None of these things will change without some form of government intervention. That\\'s because those who make decisions on the front end (buying property, building bridges) do not bear all the costs when things go wrong on the back end,\\\\\" he wrote in an email. \\\\\"And on top of that, human beings tend to discount small but important risks when it seems advantageous in the short-run.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAfter a terrible storm, he said, most Americans are willing to cheer a government that helps communities recuperate. But people should also embrace the side of government that establishes rules to avoid risk and make us safer. That\\'s harder, he said, because such edicts can be perceived by some as impinging on personal freedom.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"But viewed correctly, sensible safeguards are part of freedom, not a retreat from it,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"Freedom is having a home you can return to after the storm. Freedom is having a bridge high enough to get you to the hospital across the river. Freedom is not having your house surrounded by contaminated mud because the berm at the neighboring chemical plant failed overnight.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThaddeus R. Miller, an Arizona State University scientist who helps lead a national research network focused on \\\\\"Urban Resilience to Extreme Events,\\\\\" said in an email that boosting the capacity of cities to stay safe and prosperous in a turbulent climate requires a culture shift as much as hardening physical systems:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Fundamentally, we must abandon the idea that there is a specific standard to which we can control nature and instead understand that we are creating complex and increasingly difficult-to-control systems that are part social, part ecological and part technological. These mean not just redesigning the infrastructure, but redesigning institutions and their knowledge systems.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAfter the destruction and disruption from Hurricane Sandy, New York City didn\\'t just upgrade its power substations and subway entrances, Miller said in a subsequent phone call. The city also rebooted its agencies\\' protocols and even job descriptions. \\\\\"Every time a maintenance crew opens a sewer cover, fixes or installs a pipe, whether new or retrofitting, you\\'re thinking how to enhance its resilience,\\\\\" Miller said.\\\\n\\\\nMiller said another key to progress, particularly when federal action is limited or stalled, is cooperation between cities or regions. Heat was not an issue in Oregon historically, Miller said, but it\\'s becoming one. The light rail system around Portland was designed to work with a few 90-degree days a year, he said. \\\\\"The last couple of summers have seen 20-plus 90-degree days,\\\\\" he said, causing copper wires carrying power for the trains to sag and steel rails to expand in ways that have disrupted train schedules. Similar rail systems in the Southwest deal with such heat routinely, said Miller, who has worked in both regions. The more crosstalk, the better the outcome, he said.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"At the broadest level, we need to think about risks and how infrastructure is built to withstand them at a landscape level,\\\\\" Miller added. \\\\\"We can longer commit to evaluating the impacts and risks of a single project in isolation against a retrospective, stationary understanding of risk (e.g., the 100-year flood we\\'ve been hearing so much about.)\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHe said that an emerging alternative, \\\\\"safe-to-fail\\\\\" design, is more suited to situations where factors contributing to extreme floods or other storm impacts can\\'t be fully anticipated. \\\\\"Safe-to-fail infrastructure might allow flooding, but in ways that are designed for,\\\\\" he said.\\\\n\\\\n(With an Arizona State colleague, Mikhail Chester, Miller offered more details in a commentary published last week by The Conversation website, laying out \\\\\"six rules for rebuilding infrastructure in an era of \\'unprecedented\\' weather events.\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nDeborah Brosnan, an environmental and disaster risk consultant, said the challenge in making a shift to integrating changing risks into planning and investments is enormous, even when a community has a devastating shock such as a hurricane or flood or both:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"It requires a radical shift in how we incorporate variability in our planning and regulations,\\\\\" she said. \\\\\"This can and will be politically difficult. New regulations like California fire and earthquake codes and Florida\\'s building codes are typically enacted after an event, and from a reactive \\'make sure this doesn\\'t happen again\\' perspective. The past event creates a \\'standard\\' against which to regulate. Regulations and codes require a standard that can be upheld, otherwise decisions can be arbitrary and capricious.

(\\'I face floods; I build a dike; I\\'m safe.\\') We are trying to work against this, by having risk prevention and contingent planning done together.\\\\\"\",\"url\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.cnbc.com\\\\/2017\\\\/09\\\\/14\\\\/after-hurricanes-harvey-irma-infrastructure-discussion-in-congress.html\"},\"77\":{\"source\":\"Billboard\",\"text\":\"The singer wrote her breakthrough hit about \\\\\"never being grounded to a certain place, but having your home with people who you love.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nStruggling to adjust to her new life in Germany after moving from Canada at age 16, Alice Merton wrote her first song: an ode to homesickness titled \\\\\"Little Lighthouse.\\\\\" The burgeoning singer-songwriter, then in high school, was just beginning to branch out from a decade worth of classical music training, subbing arias for the sounds of The Alan Parsons Project and Regina Spektor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"My first song... was basically just about finding my way back home,\\\\\" Merton, now 23, tells Billboard over the phone from Berlin. \\\\\"I just didn\\'t feel at home in Germany at all in the beginning. That\\'s why I kept on searching for this lighthouse, I guess, which would take me back to Canada.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBut Germany wouldn\\'t be the last move for the singer -- who in addition to Canada has also lived in England and America, and has moved between cities a total of 11 times. In fact, the nomadic lifestyle that led to Merton\\'s first original song would also inspire her recent breakthrough hit \\\\\"No Roots,\\\\\" which catapulted her to the top of the charts in Germany -- and now, as the singer inks a deal with New York indie Mom + Pop Music, beginning to trickle over abroad.\\\\n\\\\nReleased overseas in December 2016, \\\\\"No Roots\\\\\" was quickly picked up by blogs and music discovery sites like Hypemachine, climbing to No. 2. on the Spotify Viral 50 charts just before Christmas. The song spent seven weeks on Billboard\\'s Germany Songs charts, peaking at No. 2, and has hit the top 10 on charts in Germany, Luxembourg, Austria and Switzerland since April.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I always wanted to do something with music, but to be honest, I never thought I\\'d be good enough,\\\\\" Merton says of the sudden attention. \\\\\"There\\'s so much good music out there that still hasn\\'t been heard. But I thought if I don\\'t try it, I\\'ll always regret it.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWhile the theme of wanderlust had been on her mind since \\\\\"Little Lighthouse,\\\\\" Merton says that \\\\\"No Roots\\\\\" came together two-and-a-half years ago while she was visiting her parents in England. \\\\\"I was on the beach, and I was just thinking to myself that I have no one place where I actually feel like I\\'m at home,\\\\\" Merton explains. \\\\\"I came up with the idea of having no roots -- never being grounded to a certain place, but having your home with people who you love.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe rollicking, chest-thumping track itself reads like a roadmap, telling Merton\\'s story through a marching drum kick, rugged bass and the chorus\\' chant of \\\\\"I\\'ve got no roots, but my home was never on the ground.\\\\\" And while the track could serve as an ode to globetrotters everywhere, each line is as honest to Merton\\'s experience as possible. Merton\\'s favorite line, for example -- \\\\\"I like digging holes and hiding things inside them \\\\/ when I grow old, I hope I won\\'t forget to find them\\\\\" -- isn\\'t just a figure of speech. The singer-songwriter says she has left her mark in every city she\\'s lived, whether through time capsules buried in backyards or secret messages carved into her wooden school desks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I love writing about things I know, and I like to be very honest in my music,\\\\\" Merton adds. \\\\\"I feel it\\'s much easier to be honest or be myself in songs, when I\\'m playing. That\\'s why I felt: you know, I\\'m going to write the truth.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAfter several meetings with major labels in Germany, Merton says she and her manager, Paul Grauwinkel, discussed a different option: starting their own label, and releasing \\\\\"No Roots\\\\\" on their terms. The two chose the name Paper Plane Records, partly as a homage to one of Merton\\'s favorite songs -- the 2007 M.I.A. hit \\\\\"Paper Planes\\\\\" -- and partly to symbolize their faith in hard work. \\\\\"Paper planes are made of such simple things. It\\'s a piece of paper. But they can fly for three or four meters, depending on how good you build that paper plane,\\\\\" Merton explains. \\\\\"That\\'s why we decided to call it that, because we started out with nothing.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFollowing its success abroad, \\\\\"No Roots\\\\\" has drawn 922,000 total on-demand streams (audio and video combined) in the U.S. to date, according to Nielsen Music. There\\'s more to come -- Merton is getting to work on her debut album, which she says expands on each motif in \\\\\"No Roots.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"What I\\'m doing is taking different parts from \\'No Roots,\\' whether it be the gypsy part or the holes part or needing something to stay, [and] I put all that into different songs,\\\\\" she explains. \\\\\"\\'No Roots\\' is like the stem, and the other songs branch out.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFor now, Merton is based in Berlin, though she often spends time with her family in England and would like to eventually spend time living in New York City. But she\\'ll be a nomad again soon, traveling across Germany this fall for a string of festivals including New Fall Festival in D\\\\u00fcsseldorf, Baden Baden\\'s SWR3 New Pop Festival and, back in her area, Lollapalooza Berlin. Not surprisingly, touring comes naturally to Merton -- and the singer says being onstage is the only way she can comprehend her growing success.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I don\\'t think I registered the fact that there were that many people that have heard it, or seen it,\\\\\" she says. \\\\\"They know the lyrics, they get out their cell phones, they film. That\\'s when it becomes real. That\\'s when I notice that there\\'s actually people out there who listen to my music, which is a really nice feeling.\\\\\"\",\"url\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/www.billboard.com\\\\/articles\\\\/columns\\\\/pop\\\\/7905180\\\\/alice-merton-interview-no-roots\"}}'"
