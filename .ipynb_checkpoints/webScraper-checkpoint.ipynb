His institute is testing replacements for the tired language of 1-in-100 or 1-in-500-year floods. A 100-year flood has a 1 in 4 chance of occurring in the 30-year span of a typical home mortgage, he said, adding that\\'s the kind of time scale that gets people\\'s attention.\\n\\nVisual cues matter, too, he said. On conventional maps, simple lines marking a floodplain boundary often are interpreted as separating safe zones and those at risk, Bledsoe said. But existing models of water flows don\\'t provide the full range of possible outcomes: \"A 50-year rain can produce a 100-year flood if it falls on a watershed that\\'s already soaked or on snowpack or if it coincides with a storm surge.\"\\n\\n\"The bright line on a map is an illusion,\" he said, particularly in flat places like Houston, where a slight change in flood waters can result in far more widespread inundation. Risk maps should reflect that uncertainty, and wider threat.\\n\\nNicholas Pinter, a University of California, Davis, geoscientist who studies flood risk and water management, said that Florida is well-situated to build more wisely after this disaster because it already has a statewide post-disaster redevelopment plan and requires coastal communities to have their own.\\n\\nIt\\'s more typical to have short-term recovery plans -- for digging out and getting the lights back on, as 20,000 utility workers are scurrying to do right now.\\n\\nThe advantage of having an established protocol for redevelopment, he said, is it trims delays.\\n\\n\"Draw up plans when the skies are blue and pull them off the shelf,\" he said of how having rebuilding protocols in place can limit repeating mistakes. \"That fast response cuts down on the horrible lag time in which people typically rebuild in place.\"\\n\\nVice President and Chief Maintenance Officer of New York City Transit and Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) Joseph Leader inspects a flooded stairwell down to a platform beneath street level at the South Ferry-Whitehall Subway Terminal in lower Manhattan, following Hurricane Sandy October 31, 2012. Reuters\\n\\nIn a warming climate, scientists see increasing potential for epic deluges like the one that swamped Houston and last year\\'s devastating rains around Baton Rouge, Louisiana. How can the federal government more responsibly manage such environmental threats?\\n\\nMany people point to the National Flood Insurance Program, which was created to boost financial resilience in flood zones, but has been criticized from just about every political and technical vantage point as too often working to subsidize, instead of mitigate, vulnerability.\\n\\nAs has happened periodically before, pressure is building on Congress to get serious about fixing the program (a reauthorization deadline was just pushed from this monthtoward the end of the year).\\n\\nHow this debate plays out will have an important impact on infrastructure resilience, said Pinter of the University of California, Davis. If incentives remain skewed in favor of dangerous and sprawling development, he said, that just expands where roads, wires, pipelines and other connecting systems have to be built. \"Public infrastructure is there in service of populations,\" he said.\\n\\nHe also said the lack of federal guidance has led to deeply uneven enforcement of floodplain building at the state level, with enormous disparities around the country resulting in more resilient states, in essence, subsidizing disaster-prone development in others.\\n\\n\"Why should California, Wyoming or Utah be paying the price for Houston, Mississippi or Alabama failing to enforce the National Flood Insurance Program? \" he said.\\n\\nBledsoe, at the University of Georgia, said there\\'s no need to wait for big changes in the program to start making progress.\\n\\nHe said the National Flood Insurance Program has a longstanding division, the Community Rating System, that could swiftly be expanded, cutting both flood risk and budget-breaking payouts. It\\'s a voluntary program that reduces flood insurance rates for communities that take additional efforts beyond minimum standards to reduce flood damage to insurable property.\\n\\nDespite the clear benefits, he said, only one municipality, Roseville, California, has achieved the top level of nine rankings and gotten the biggest insurance savings -- 45 percent. Tulsa, Oklahoma, Fort Collins, Colorado, King County, Washington, and Pierce County, Washington, are at the second ranking and get a 40 percent rate cut. Hundreds of other municipalities are at much lower levels of preparedness.\\n\\n\"Boosting participation is low-hanging fruit,\" Bledsoe said.\\n\\nA man carries a dog from a rescue boat as it evacuates people from the rising waters of Buffalo Bayou following Hurricane Harvey in a neighborhood west of Houston, Texas, U.S., August 30, 2017. Reuters/Carlo Allegri\\n\\nSome see signs that the recent blitz of hurricanes is reshaping strategies in the Trump White House.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump\\'s infrastructure agenda, unveiled on August 15, centered on rescinding Obama-era plans to require consideration of flood risk and climate change in any federal spending for infrastructure or housing and the like.\\n\\nThe argument was built around limiting perceived red tape.\\n\\nAfter the flooding of Houston less than two weeks later, Trump appointees, including Tom Bossert, the president\\'s homeland security adviser, said a new plan was being developed to insure federal money would not increase flood risks.\\n\\nOn Monday, as Irma weakened over Georgia, Bossert used a White House briefing to offer more hints of an emerging climate resilience policy, while notably avoiding accepting climate change science: \"What President Trump is committed to is making sure that federal dollars aren\\'t used to rebuild things that will be in harm\\'s way later or that won\\'t be hardened against the future predictable floods that we see.\\n\\nAnd that has to do with engineering analysis and changing conditions along eroding shorelines but also in inland water and flood-control projects.\"\\n\\nRobert R.M. Verchick, a Loyola University law professor who worked on climate change adaptation policy at the Environmental Protection Agency under Obama, said federal leadership is essential.\\n\\nIf Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps incorporated future climate conditions, that move would send a ripple effect into real estate and insurance markets, forcing people to pay attention, he said.\\n\\nThis Thursday, Sept. 7, 2017 photo shows storm damage in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands. Irma scraped Cuba\\'s northern coast Friday on a course toward Florida, leaving in its wake a ravaged string of Caribbean resort islands strewn with splintered lumber, corrugated metal and broken concrete. Jalon Manson Shortte/AP\\n\\nIf the federal government required projected climate conditions to be considered when spending on infrastructure in flood-prone areas, construction practices would change, he added, noting the same pressures would drive chemical plants or other industries to have a wider margin of safety.\\n\\n\"None of these things will change without some form of government intervention. That\\'s because those who make decisions on the front end (buying property, building bridges) do not bear all the costs when things go wrong on the back end,\" he wrote in an email. \"And on top of that, human beings tend to discount small but important risks when it seems advantageous in the short-run.\"\\n\\nAfter a terrible storm, he said, most Americans are willing to cheer a government that helps communities recuperate. But people should also embrace the side of government that establishes rules to avoid risk and make us safer. That\\'s harder, he said, because such edicts can be perceived by some as impinging on personal freedom.\\n\\n\"But viewed correctly, sensible safeguards are part of freedom, not a retreat from it,\" he said. \"Freedom is having a home you can return to after the storm. Freedom is having a bridge high enough to get you to the hospital across the river. Freedom is not having your house surrounded by contaminated mud because the berm at the neighboring chemical plant failed overnight.\"\\n\\nInterstate 10 is closed due to floodwaters from Tropical Storm Harvey Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2017, in Houston. AP/David J. Phillip\\n\\nThaddeus R. Miller, an Arizona State University scientist who helps lead a national research network focused on \"Urban Resilience to Extreme Events,\" said in an email that boosting the capacity of cities to stay safe and prosperous in a turbulent climate requires a culture shift as much as hardening physical systems:\\n\\n\"Fundamentally, we must abandon the idea that there is a specific standard to which we can control nature and instead understand that we are creating complex and increasingly difficult-to-control systems that are part social, part ecological and part technological. These mean not just redesigning the infrastructure, but redesigning institutions and their knowledge systems.\"\\n\\nAfter the destruction and disruption from Hurricane Sandy, New York City didn\\'t just upgrade its power substations and subway entrances, Miller said in a subsequent phone call. The city also rebooted its agencies\\' protocols and even job descriptions. \"Every time a maintenance crew opens a sewer cover, fixes or installs a pipe, whether new or retrofitting, you\\'re thinking how to enhance its resilience,\" Miller said.\\n\\nMiller said another key to progress, particularly when federal action is limited or stalled, is cooperation between cities or regions. Heat was not an issue in Oregon historically, Miller said, but it\\'s becoming one. The light rail system around Portland was designed to work with a few 90-degree days a year, he said. \"The last couple of summers have seen 20-plus 90-degree days,\" he said, causing copper wires carrying power for the trains to sag and steel rails to expand in ways that have disrupted train schedules. Similar rail systems in the Southwest deal with such heat routinely, said Miller, who has worked in both regions. The more crosstalk, the better the outcome, he said.\\n\\n\"At the broadest level, we need to think about risks and how infrastructure is built to withstand them at a landscape level,\" Miller added. \"We can longer commit to evaluating the impacts and risks of a single project in isolation against a retrospective, stationary understanding of risk (e.g., the 100-year flood we\\'ve been hearing so much about.)\"\\n\\nHe said that an emerging alternative, \"safe-to-fail\" design, is more suited to situations where factors contributing to extreme floods or other storm impacts can\\'t be fully anticipated. \"Safe-to-fail infrastructure might allow flooding, but in ways that are designed for,\" he said.\\n\\n(With an Arizona State colleague, Mikhail Chester, Miller offered more details in a commentary published last week by The Conversation website, laying out \"six rules for rebuilding infrastructure in an era of \\'unprecedented\\' weather events.\")\\n\\nPeople evacuate a neighborhood inundated by floodwaters from Tropical Storm Harvey on Monday, Aug. 28, 2017, in Houston, Texas. Charlie Riedel/AP\\n\\nDeborah Brosnan, an environmental and disaster risk consultant, said the challenge in making a shift to integrating changing risks into planning and investments is enormous, even when a community has a devastating shock such as a hurricane or flood or both:\\n\\n\"It requires a radical shift in how we incorporate variability in our planning and regulations,\" she said. \"This can and will be politically difficult. New regulations like California fire and earthquake codes and Florida\\'s building codes are typically enacted after an event, and from a reactive \\'make sure this doesn\\'t happen again\\' perspective. The past event creates a \\'standard\\' against which to regulate.\\n\\nRegulations and codes require a standard that can be upheld, otherwise decisions can be arbitrary and capricious. For climate change, non-stationarity would involve creating regulations that take account of many different factors and where variability has to be included. Variability (uncertainy) is the big challenge for these kinds of approaches.\"\\n\\nStephane Hallegatte, the lead economist at the Word Bank\\'s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, has written or co-written a host of reports on strategies for limiting impacts of climate change and disasters, particularly on the poor.\\n\\nWhen asked in an email exchange what success would look like, he said the World Bank, in various recent reports, has stressed the importance of managing disaster risks along two tracks: both designing and investing to limit the most frequent hard knocks and then making sure the tools and services are available to help communities recover when a worst-case disaster strikes.\\n\\nHe added: \"Facing a problem, people tend to do one thing to manage it, and then forget about it. (\\'I face floods; I build a dike; I\\'m safe.\\') We are trying to work against this, by having risk prevention and contingent planning done together.\"'}, {'url': 'http://www.govtech.com/fs/Rethinking-the-Infrastructure-Discussion-Amid-a-Blitz-of-Hurricanes.html', 'source': 'Public CIO magazine', 'text': 'Gaston Kirby, right, and Juan Minutella leave Kirby\\'s flooded home in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Monday, Sept. 4, 2017, near the Addicks and Barker Reservoirs, in Houston.

He said the National Flood Insurance Program has a longstanding division, the Community Rating System, that could swiftly be expanded, cutting both flood risk and budget-breaking payouts. It\\'s a voluntary program that reduces flood insurance rates for communities that take additional efforts beyond minimum standards to reduce flood damage to insurable property.\\n\\nDespite the clear benefits, he said, only one municipality, Roseville, California, has achieved the top level of nine rankings and gotten the biggest insurance savings -- 45 percent. Tulsa, Oklahoma, Fort Collins, Colorado, King County, Washington, and Pierce County, Washington, are at the second ranking and get a 40 percent rate cut. Hundreds of other municipalities are at much lower levels of preparedness.\\n\\n\"Boosting participation is low-hanging fruit,\" Bledsoe said.\\n\\nSome see signs that the recent blitz of hurricanes is reshaping strategies in the Trump White House. President Donald Trump\\'s infrastructure agenda, unveiled on August 15, centered on rescinding Obama-era plans to require consideration of flood risk and climate change in any federal spending for infrastructure or housing and the like. The argument was built around limiting perceived red tape.\\n\\nAfter the flooding of Houston less than two weeks later, Trump appointees, including Tom Bossert, the president\\'s homeland security adviser, said a new plan was being developed to insure federal money would not increase flood risks.\\n\\nOn Monday, as Irma weakened over Georgia, Bossert used a White House briefing to offer more hints of an emerging climate resilience policy, while notably avoiding accepting climate change science: \"What President Trump is committed to is making sure that federal dollars aren\\'t used to rebuild things that will be in harm\\'s way later or that won\\'t be hardened against the future predictable floods that we see. And that has to do with engineering analysis and changing conditions along eroding shorelines but also in inland water and flood-control projects.\"\\n\\nRobert R.M. Verchick, a Loyola University law professor who worked on climate change adaptation policy at the Environmental Protection Agency under Obama, said federal leadership is essential.\\n\\nIf Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps incorporated future climate conditions, that move would send a ripple effect into real estate and insurance markets, forcing people to pay attention, he said. If the federal government required projected climate conditions to be considered when spending on infrastructure in flood-prone areas, construction practices would change, he added, noting the same pressures would drive chemical plants or other industries to have a wider margin of safety.\\n\\n\"None of these things will change without some form of government intervention. That\\'s because those who make decisions on the front end (buying property, building bridges) do not bear all the costs when things go wrong on the back end,\" he wrote in an email. \"And on top of that, human beings tend to discount small but important risks when it seems advantageous in the short-run.\"\\n\\nAfter a terrible storm, he said, most Americans are willing to cheer a government that helps communities recuperate. But people should also embrace the side of government that establishes rules to avoid risk and make us safer. That\\'s harder, he said, because such edicts can be perceived by some as impinging on personal freedom.\\n\\n\"But viewed correctly, sensible safeguards are part of freedom, not a retreat from it,\" he said. \"Freedom is having a home you can return to after the storm. Freedom is having a bridge high enough to get you to the hospital across the river. Freedom is not having your house surrounded by contaminated mud because the berm at the neighboring chemical plant failed overnight.\"\\n\\nThaddeus R. Miller, an Arizona State University scientist who helps lead a national research network focused on \"Urban Resilience to Extreme Events,\" said in an email that boosting the capacity of cities to stay safe and prosperous in a turbulent climate requires a culture shift as much as hardening physical systems:\\n\\n\"Fundamentally, we must abandon the idea that there is a specific standard to which we can control nature and instead understand that we are creating complex and increasingly difficult-to-control systems that are part social, part ecological and part technological. These mean not just redesigning the infrastructure, but redesigning institutions and their knowledge systems.\"\\n\\nAfter the destruction and disruption from Hurricane Sandy, New York City didn\\'t just upgrade its power substations and subway entrances, Miller said in a subsequent phone call. The city also rebooted its agencies\\' protocols and even job descriptions. \"Every time a maintenance crew opens a sewer cover, fixes or installs a pipe, whether new or retrofitting, you\\'re thinking how to enhance its resilience,\" Miller said.\\n\\nMiller said another key to progress, particularly when federal action is limited or stalled, is cooperation between cities or regions. Heat was not an issue in Oregon historically, Miller said, but it\\'s becoming one. The light rail system around Portland was designed to work with a few 90-degree days a year, he said. \"The last couple of summers have seen 20-plus 90-degree days,\" he said, causing copper wires carrying power for the trains to sag and steel rails to expand in ways that have disrupted train schedules. Similar rail systems in the Southwest deal with such heat routinely, said Miller, who has worked in both regions. The more crosstalk, the better the outcome, he said.\\n\\n\"At the broadest level, we need to think about risks and how infrastructure is built to withstand them at a landscape level,\" Miller added. \"We can longer commit to evaluating the impacts and risks of a single project in isolation against a retrospective, stationary understanding of risk (e.g., the 100-year flood we\\'ve been hearing so much about.)\"\\n\\nHe said that an emerging alternative, \"safe-to-fail\" design, is more suited to situations where factors contributing to extreme floods or other storm impacts can\\'t be fully anticipated. \"Safe-to-fail infrastructure might allow flooding, but in ways that are designed for,\" he said.\\n\\n(With an Arizona State colleague, Mikhail Chester, Miller offered more details in a commentary published last week by The Conversation website, laying out \"six rules for rebuilding infrastructure in an era of \\'unprecedented\\' weather events.\")\\n\\nDeborah Brosnan, an environmental and disaster risk consultant, said the challenge in making a shift to integrating changing risks into planning and investments is enormous, even when a community has a devastating shock such as a hurricane or flood or both:\\n\\n\"It requires a radical shift in how we incorporate variability in our planning and regulations,\" she said. \"This can and will be politically difficult. New regulations like California fire and earthquake codes and Florida\\'s building codes are typically enacted after an event, and from a reactive \\'make sure this doesn\\'t happen again\\' perspective. The past event creates a \\'standard\\' against which to regulate. Regulations and codes require a standard that can be upheld, otherwise decisions can be arbitrary and capricious. For climate change, non-stationarity would involve creating regulations that take account of many different factors and where variability has to be included. Variability (uncertainy) is the big challenge for these kinds of approaches.\"\\n\\nStephane Hallegatte, the lead economist at the Word Bank\\'s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, has written or co-written a host of reports on strategies for limiting impacts of climate change and disasters, particularly on the poor. When asked in an email exchange what success would look like, he said the World Bank, in various recent reports, has stressed the importance of managing disaster risks along two tracks: both designing and investing to limit the most frequent hard knocks and then making sure the tools and services are available to help communities recover when a worst-case disaster strikes.\\n\\nHe added: \"Facing a problem, people tend to do one thing to manage it, and then forget about it. (\\'I face floods; I build a dike; I\\'m safe.\\') We are trying to work against this, by having risk prevention and contingent planning done together.\"'}, {'url': 'https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/14/after-hurricanes-harvey-irma-infrastructure-discussion-in-congress.html', 'source': 'CNBC', 'text': 'The wonky words infrastructure and resilience have circulated widely of late, particularly since Hurricanes Harvey and Irma struck paralyzing, costly blows in two of America\\'s fastest-growing states.\\n\\nResilience is a property traditionally defined as the ability to bounce back. A host of engineers and urban planners have long warned this trait is sorely lacking in America\\'s brittle infrastructure.\\n\\nMany such experts say the disasters in the sprawling suburban and petro-industrial landscape around Houston and along the crowded coasts of Florida reinforce the urgent idea that resilient infrastructure is needed more than ever, particularly as human-driven climate change helps drive extreme weather.\\n\\nThe challenge in prompting change -- broadening the classic definition of \"infrastructure,\" and investing in initiatives aimed at adapting to a turbulent planet -- is heightened by partisan divisions over climate policy and development.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s also the question of money. The country\\'s infrastructure is ailing already. A national civil engineering group has surveyed the nation\\'s bridges, roads, dams, transit systems and more and awarded a string of D or D+ grades since 1998. The same group has estimated that the country will be several trillion dollars short of what\\'s needed to harden and rebuild and modernize our infrastructure over the next decade.\\n\\nFor fresh or underappreciated ideas, ProPublica reached out to a handful of engineers, economists and policy analysts focused on reducing risk on a fast-changing planet.\\n\\nAlice Hill, who directed resilience policy for the National Security Council in the Obama administration, said the wider debate over cutting climate-warming emissions may have distracted people from promptly pursuing ways to reduce risks and economic and societal costs from natural disasters.\\n\\nShe and several other experts said a first step is getting past the old definition of resilience as bouncing back from a hit, which presumes a community needs simply to recover.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think of resilience in the traditional sense, in cutting how long it takes to turn the lights back on,\" said Brian Bledsoe, the director of the Institute for Resilient Infrastructure Systems at the University of Georgia. \"Resilience is seizing an opportunity to move into a state of greater adaptability and preparedness -- not just going back to the status quo.\"\\n\\nIn thinking about improving the country\\'s infrastructure, and provoking real action, Bledsoe and others say, language matters.\\n\\nBledsoe, for instance, is exploring new ways to communicate flood risk in words and maps. His institute is testing replacements for the tired language of 1-in-100 or 1-in-500-year floods. A 100-year flood has a 1 in 4 chance of occurring in the 30-year span of a typical home mortgage, he said, adding that\\'s the kind of time scale that gets people\\'s attention.\\n\\nVisual cues matter, too, he said. On conventional maps, simple lines marking a floodplain boundary often are interpreted as separating safe zones and those at risk, Bledsoe said. But existing models of water flows don\\'t provide the full range of possible outcomes: \"A 50-year rain can produce a 100-year flood if it falls on a watershed that\\'s already soaked or on snowpack or if it coincides with a storm surge.\"\\n\\n\"The bright line on a map is an illusion,\" he said, particularly in flat places like Houston, where a slight change in flood waters can result in far more widespread inundation. Risk maps should reflect that uncertainty, and wider threat.\\n\\nNicholas Pinter, a University of California, Davis, geoscientist who studies flood risk and water management, said that Florida is well-situated to build more wisely after this disaster because it already has a statewide post-disaster redevelopment plan and requires coastal communities to have their own.\\n\\nIt\\'s more typical to have short-term recovery plans -- for digging out and getting the lights back on, as 20,000 utility workers are scurrying to do right now.\\n\\nThe advantage of having an established protocol for redevelopment, he said, is it trims delays.\\n\\n\"Draw up plans when the skies are blue and pull them off the shelf,\" he said of how having rebuilding protocols in place can limit repeating mistakes. \"That fast response cuts down on the horrible lag time in which people typically rebuild in place.\"\\n\\nIn a warming climate, scientists see increasing potential for epic deluges like the one that swamped Houston and last year\\'s devastating rains around Baton Rouge, Louisiana. How can the federal government more responsibly manage such environmental threats?\\n\\nMany people point to the National Flood Insurance Program, which was created to boost financial resilience in flood zones, but has been criticized from just about every political and technical vantage point as too often working to subsidize, instead of mitigate, vulnerability.\\n\\nAs has happened periodically before, pressure is building on Congress to get serious about fixing the program (a reauthorization deadline was just pushed from this month toward the end of the year).\\n\\nHow this debate plays out will have an important impact on infrastructure resilience, said Pinter of the University of California, Davis.

That\\'s why I kept on searching for this lighthouse, I guess, which would take me back to Canada.\"\\n\\nBut Germany wouldn\\'t be the last move for the singer -- who in addition to Canada has also lived in England and America, and has moved between cities a total of 11 times. In fact, the nomadic lifestyle that led to Merton\\'s first original song would also inspire her recent breakthrough hit \"No Roots,\" which catapulted her to the top of the charts in Germany -- and now, as the singer inks a deal with New York indie Mom + Pop Music, beginning to trickle over abroad.\\n\\nReleased overseas in December 2016, \"No Roots\" was quickly picked up by blogs and music discovery sites like Hypemachine, climbing to No. 2. on the Spotify Viral 50 charts just before Christmas. The song spent seven weeks on Billboard\\'s Germany Songs charts, peaking at No. 2, and has hit the top 10 on charts in Germany, Luxembourg, Austria and Switzerland since April.\\n\\n\"I always wanted to do something with music, but to be honest, I never thought I\\'d be good enough,\" Merton says of the sudden attention. \"There\\'s so much good music out there that still hasn\\'t been heard. But I thought if I don\\'t try it, I\\'ll always regret it.\"\\n\\nWhile the theme of wanderlust had been on her mind since \"Little Lighthouse,\" Merton says that \"No Roots\" came together two-and-a-half years ago while she was visiting her parents in England. \"I was on the beach, and I was just thinking to myself that I have no one place where I actually feel like I\\'m at home,\" Merton explains. \"I came up with the idea of having no roots -- never being grounded to a certain place, but having your home with people who you love.\"\\n\\nThe rollicking, chest-thumping track itself reads like a roadmap, telling Merton\\'s story through a marching drum kick, rugged bass and the chorus\\' chant of \"I\\'ve got no roots, but my home was never on the ground.\" And while the track could serve as an ode to globetrotters everywhere, each line is as honest to Merton\\'s experience as possible. Merton\\'s favorite line, for example -- \"I like digging holes and hiding things inside them / when I grow old, I hope I won\\'t forget to find them\" -- isn\\'t just a figure of speech. The singer-songwriter says she has left her mark in every city she\\'s lived, whether through time capsules buried in backyards or secret messages carved into her wooden school desks.\\n\\n\"I love writing about things I know, and I like to be very honest in my music,\" Merton adds. \"I feel it\\'s much easier to be honest or be myself in songs, when I\\'m playing. That\\'s why I felt: you know, I\\'m going to write the truth.\"\\n\\nAfter several meetings with major labels in Germany, Merton says she and her manager, Paul Grauwinkel, discussed a different option: starting their own label, and releasing \"No Roots\" on their terms. The two chose the name Paper Plane Records, partly as a homage to one of Merton\\'s favorite songs -- the 2007 M.I.A. hit \"Paper Planes\" -- and partly to symbolize their faith in hard work. \"Paper planes are made of such simple things. It\\'s a piece of paper. But they can fly for three or four meters, depending on how good you build that paper plane,\" Merton explains. \"That\\'s why we decided to call it that, because we started out with nothing.\"\\n\\nFollowing its success abroad, \"No Roots\" has drawn 922,000 total on-demand streams (audio and video combined) in the U.S. to date, according to Nielsen Music. There\\'s more to come -- Merton is getting to work on her debut album, which she says expands on each motif in \"No Roots.\"\\n\\n\"What I\\'m doing is taking different parts from \\'No Roots,\\' whether it be the gypsy part or the holes part or needing something to stay, [and] I put all that into different songs,\" she explains. \"\\'No Roots\\' is like the stem, and the other songs branch out.\"\\n\\nFor now, Merton is based in Berlin, though she often spends time with her family in England and would like to eventually spend time living in New York City. But she\\'ll be a nomad again soon, traveling across Germany this fall for a string of festivals including New Fall Festival in D\\xc3\\xbcsseldorf, Baden Baden\\'s SWR3 New Pop Festival and, back in her area, Lollapalooza Berlin. Not surprisingly, touring comes naturally to Merton -- and the singer says being onstage is the only way she can comprehend her growing success.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I registered the fact that there were that many people that have heard it, or seen it,\" she says. \"They know the lyrics, they get out their cell phones, they film. That\\'s when it becomes real. That\\'s when I notice that there\\'s actually people out there who listen to my music, which is a really nice feeling.\"'}]\n"
