0,0,"Sometimes it's time to move on. And while sometimes that's obvious -- like when your work environment is downright dangerous or toxic -- sometimes we can get lulled into staying somewhere we really ought to move on from because it's comfortable.

In this week's episode of Industry Focus: Financials, host Gaby Lapera and Motley Fool contributor Dan Kline explain how to know when it's time to move on from your job. Then the cast looks at how to find a new job while you're still working at your old job, how to network, how and why to leave your old job gracefully and tactfully, how honest you'll want to be about your resume -- spoilers: pretty honest -- when it's appropriate to take any position to get your foot in the door and when you'll want to avoid that, and more.

A full transcript follows the video.

Gaby Lapera: Hello everyone! Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. You're listening to the Financials edition, taped on Thursday, August 3rd, 2017. My name is Gaby Lapera, and joining me in the studio is Dan Kline, one of my favorite writers here at The Motley Fool and jack of all trades. Hello, Dan!

Dan Kline: Hello and thank you! I didn't know that. Top ten or top 100?

Lapera: I'm not going to tell you, and also don't tell the other writers. [laughs]

Kline: Well, you can be quite sure that none of the other writers ever watch a podcast they're not on.

Lapera: Fair enough. So, this show is pre-taped. I have no idea when it's going to go out, so if there's some sort of huge financial news that I'm ignoring, it's not on purpose. I'm probably sick or on vacation. I promise I'll cover it when I get back next week. But I bet Motley Fool Money or Market Foolery has said something about it in the meantime. Anyway, turning to our show today, I don't know if you guys remember, but Dan and I did a careers-based show a while back. I don't know how far back, because I don't know when you're listening to this.

Kline: Fourth of July, basically.

Lapera: Over Fourth of July. It was really great, and we got a lot of really good feedback about it, so I invited Dan back again. We're going to talk about two main topics today, one of which is how do you know when it's time to leave a job, and how to find a job when you already have one, and how to leave gracefully. So, those are the two big topics. How to know when to leave a job, I know it varies from person to person but there's a few big things. You see the writing on the wall.

Kline: Yeah. I think the big thing is, people get very scared. They have a job, they're getting a paycheck, they have health insurance, all the things they need.

Lapera: Oh, I love health insurance.

Kline: And they don't think about happiness. You're not going to walk in and quit your job when your job is good enough. But you should start thinking about it. You should start looking. You say ""the writing is on the wall,"" and that can mean a few different things. Maybe you're up for a promotion and you don't get it. Maybe there's just no place to go. You're looking and you're saying, ""I could do this job for the next 20 years. Boy, I would have to do this job for the next 20 years."" And you should think about those things, and not be afraid to open your eyes. It doesn't mean you storm into the boss' office and quit, it doesn't mean you leave Friday and don't come back on Monday. But you should be open to the idea, even though that can be terrifying.

Lapera: Definitely. To circle back around to reasons you might want to quit, but you're not in a huge hurry to quit, like you said, having health insurance is great. But I don't know, you look around the company and you see that maybe there are money issues, and maybe you're worried about the future of the company. You don't think it's going to go bankrupt tomorrow, but you're not really sure if they're going to be around in 10 years.

Kline: What you don't want to be, and I've worked at companies that have run out of money, I've worked at companies that have been teetering. I came up through the internet age, where I worked at a very large internet company that went through something like $80 million in two years.

Lapera: God.

Kline: Which was normal back then. You didn't make money, but you might in the future. None of those companies exist anymore. But if you're working at a company and you start to see things like your direct deposit is two days late, or if you still get a physical check, which I think only about 30% of Americans do, but you still get a physical check and you have to race to the bank because the exact amount is in the account, those are things when you start looking. If you work even with just a handful of people and the company does go out of business, you don't want to be the sixth person from that company who's sending out a resume. So there are situations where you want to get ahead of it. And sometimes it's quality of life. You might have a job you like and your boss leaves, and the new boss, it might not even be a person who's mean, it just might be a style that you don't like, or your talents and their talents are too close together so you don't have the autonomy you once did. It's OK to leave your job because you don't love your job anymore.

Lapera: Yeah, definitely. I will put in a plug that if you work in a toxic work environment, probably time to find a new job.

Kline: Sure. We've written about this a lot. There are a few scenarios where you can leave your job and not give notice, and one of them is if it's dangerous. If you're working for a boss who's saying things like, ""Yeah, I know you think driving 10 hours a day is enough, but I really need you in California tomorrow, so drive straight through until you get there,"" that may not be a safe scenario.

Lapera: Any place where OSHA requirements are being ignored, maybe leave. And I'm not talking about, ""Oh, I stood up on my spinny chair to change a lightbulb because maintenance wasn't fast enough.""

Kline: See, my family is in the ladder business, that kind of stuff drives me insane. That's a good example, if you work someplace where they don't have the proper tools and they ask you to do dangerous things, and you have to judge that for yourself. Maybe standing on that chair to change a lightbulb that's six feet in the air doesn't seem that scary. But if they have an eight foot ladder for a job that needs a 12 foot ladder and you're standing on the top step that says ""not a step,"" which is my email address, if you see an email from me, that's time to go. And other situations -- if you're being sexually harassed, if you're being threatened. But those are not the biggest scenarios. Obviously, they happen. And it's really more of a case of, you have to evaluate. You have to look at your job, and when you stop wanting to get up in the morning ... not all of us can say, ""OK, I don't like this anymore, now I'm done,"" because we still need money and we like to eat. But that's when you can start being open to other things beyond just, ""Yeah, I look at the classifieds for my industry, whatever internet form that takes, and if the dream job was out there, maybe I would apply."" Maybe you start looking at things that would be lateral moves just to shake up your life a little bit.

Lapera: That's actually a really good point. If you get super comfortable at a job, and you look around and you're like, ""What am I doing with my life?""

Kline: Look, there's times in your life, and I'm older than you, as I'm sure anybody watching this can tell, when my son was born -- he's 13 now -- I specifically took jobs based on that I could not be a newspaper editor and have a newborn at home. You can't have a 02:00 AM deadline every night and also be a decent parent. I'm sure people have done it. I don't want to insult anyone who has. But it wasn't going to work for me. So I took a job in my family business in the construction area where very rarely did customers ever need me at night. It was a 07:00 AM to 04:00 PM kind of job. And after two years, I was good at it, and I was looking around going, ""What am I doing with my life? I'm an editor and I'm a writer,"" but I had to wait until my son was a little older and I could move on. So, sometimes boring is OK. But if you don't have those impediments, if you don't have things in your life or reasons -- maybe you have a health issue and you don't want to risk any change in coverage, or something. If those aren't there, life should be exciting. We work a lot. I don't know about you, but 07:00 AM to 05:00 PM can be normal for me. I see that you guys are on, you edit things of mine at 11:00 at night.

Lapera: Yeah, I'm a little bit more of a night owl. That's my issue. So, I get to work late, but then I'm also at work late.

Kline: Yeah. And if you like your work, I think that's great. I'm sure getting to read stories I've written at 11:00 at night is basically like a new show premiering on Netflix, I'm sure it's delightful.

Lapera: Definitely, it's scintillating, I just can't look away.

Kline: But if you don't feel that way ... and maybe it's simple. Maybe the co-workers you had lunch with have all moved on, and the parts you enjoyed about your day have just become drudgery. You can leave. In most cases, you have more value than you think you do. And it's generally easier to get a job when you have a job, as opposed to being unemployed, you become a little bit tainted in the eyes of the people doing the hiring.

Lapera: No, definitely. I think, there's nothing wrong with being comfortable. There's some people who really love their jobs, and they could go into work every day and do the exact same thing for 20 years. And that's awesome. I think that's incredible. I'm not one of those people.

Kline: Neither am I. This is the longest I've ever been working for the same company. But what's interesting about what we do here at Fool, especially those of us who are work from home writers, is that you can make the job whatever you want it to be. So, I work on these podcasts sometimes, I do other special projects. Nobody ever calls and asks you, most of the time, ""Hey, would you like to be involved in a special project?"" You usually have to stand up. So, sometimes it isn't leaving your job. Sometimes it's going to your boss or other people in the company and saying, ""Things are a little stagnant for me, boy I would love to learn this department, we should be in this field."" So you don't always have to leave to leave. You might transfer. You might just create new little wrinkles in your job. It's something you've done here bunch of times.

Lapera: Definitely. Yeah, like, podcast, I was originally not allowed to do that, and now here I am because Kristine hated the financial sector. She used to do this podcast, actually. And just a quick point about that, there are good and bad ways to ask to do new things. A bad way would be going to your boss and saying, ""Hey, man, I'm super bored and I hate my job now! Fix it!"" [laughs]

Kline: You have to approach everything as a positive. There's one major caveat to this. You cannot go to your boss and ask for new responsibilities or even different responsibilities if you're not doing your job well. So, it's very important, when you get bored, to not let that leak into your performance. So if you're someone who's always eager in meetings, and over the course of time becomes someone who sits in the back and doesn't participate, that's going to be noticed. And if it has happened, you need to address it. You need to go to your boss and say, ""Here's what's happening, here's why, I'm going to correct this, but I would also like to move into these areas."" But if you've done a good job, then you point it out to your boss. And sometimes it is, ""I'll do this extra, I'll take this on on the side to see if we can create revenue, momentum, a reason for this to exist."" And we've seen that here at Fool over and over again. You and I both work on the Careers content, which is a relatively new -- which is why we're talking today -- area for us. And we've tried lots of different experiments, and they don't all work. [laughs]

Lapera: Oh, yeah.

Kline: But it's delightful when one does work, and it becomes something we do. And I think, if you work in an office and you have a well laid-out plan that isn't a huge expenditure, and you walk into your boss and your boss just wants things to be exactly as they are, well that tells you a lot about your job and your future and whether you want to be there or not. So, that might be a sign where you say, ""OK, I've tried here, and now it's time to go.""

Lapera: Definitely. Just to recap a little bit: reasons that you might want to leave your job. Maybe not a bad work environment, but a boring work environment where there's not a lot of opportunity.

Kline: You've done it all.

Lapera: You've just done it all, and there may be no opportunity to progress or do anything new. Maybe you've been passed over for a promotion, and there's no more opportunity for promotion. Or maybe you just don't like who you're working for. It's not horrible, but you just don't like them very much.

Kline: We're not really talking today about obvious situations, where they made you take a pay cut so you're going to quit, or something terrible has happened. These are just sort of the [groans]. And when life becomes [groans], then it's time to pack up your desk.

Lapera: I'm going to love seeing how the transcriptionist writes that noise. Sorry. [laughs]

Kline: Hey, if they could handle the singing on Answers, I'm pretty sure they'll be able to figure that out.

Lapera: OK, let's turn to our second topic, which is actually leaving a job. Again, we're still talking about a job that you find tolerable, but maybe not life-affirming. And not all jobs are life-affirming, I know that. I've had plenty of non life-affirming jobs. But you're getting ready to look for a new job. What are some of the things that you should keep in mind?

Kline: First of all, if you have a job and you're not going to be there for 30 years -- if you're a school teacher or nurse and that's what you do, and your goal is to stay in the same place, these things may not be as important. But most people, when they take a job, go in with the idea that it's probably not the rest of their life. Networking is the most important thing. And I don't just mean big ticket, like, ""I'm going to go to the industry trade show and meet the president of so and so!""

Lapera: But you should do that.

Kline: You should do that. But I mean, really going through your LinkedIn contacts, your Facebook, your Rolodex, which I know isn't a thing anymore, and you probably think it's the candy with the caramel inside. But no, your Rolodex is your contacts, everybody you know. And think, ""Hey, does my former intern now work someplace where she could put in a word for me? Does my mother's friend have a contact?"" And the important thing to do is, you want to warm up those relationships, because you don't want to just be the person who, after three years of no contact, emails someone and says, ""Can I have a favor?"" So, that might be as simple as just interacting with them on Facebook by putting a comment on their photo of their dog, or whatever it is.

Lapera: Yeah, asking them out for coffee.

Kline: Yeah, asking them out for coffee. Just having them know who you are in a way beyond, when you ask them for the favor, you have to email them and say, ""You may remember me from three years ago when I was your intern supervisor,"" or whatever it is. But you really should look to everyone out there. And if you don't have the contacts, let's say you really want to change professions, you're working in one area, go meet the people that are necessary.

Lapera: And this really isn't that hard. I think a lot of people get really intimidated by this idea that you can literally just email someone and be like, ""Hey, I would love to work in,"" this actually happened to me a couple months ago, ""I would love to work in online media. Can I grab lunch with you?"" And I was not particularly interested in meeting this person, but they were a friend of friend, and I was like, ""Sure, you know what, let's grab coffee instead,"" because that's less of a commitment. But I was happy to help out this person that I had never talked to in my entire life.

Kline: It happens to me all the time, because parents gets scared, their kids are in year three of communications school, they're getting a degree that doesn't correspond to a job. And sometimes it's just helping them talk it out. I have a very good friend whose son was in the financials space making really good money and he wanted to work in sports journalism. So we sat down and talked it out and we talked about [how] a lot of radio hosts are also the sales director. So, you have all this business experience -- he's actually a producer for Sirius XM now, of business shows. So he's not quite in sports, but he's closer to what he wants to do, and he's in radio, which is something. So, it really is, most people like to be a hero. That's a phrase you'll see me use in articles a lot, we've talked about it here. If you contact someone and you go have coffee and you say, ""Yeah, I really need a foot in the door here,"" somebody somewhere down the line is going to ask them, ""Do you know an entry-level person? I need an assistant, I need a part-timer, ""or whatever it is. And they might go, ""Oh, yeah, I do know someone."" And that's how you get your foot in the door. And it might be your way out from a situation you're not that happy in.

Lapera: Definitely. I think the other thing to think about when you're looking for work is you need to think about what you want to do, and you need to think, what are the things you're looking for in a job that will make you happy? Or that you really need in your life? You mentioned having a set schedule so you could pick up your son from day care, or whatever it was. Or maybe you just graduated from law school and you have a ton of debt, and you're like, ""I'm going to work for a law firm that I don't really like for a little bit because they have a lot of money.""

Kline: Yeah. You sort of need to make your pie chart of priorities. And they're going to change. There might be points in your life where, pretend two years from now you're getting married, and you and your future spouse are sitting down and you want to buy a house in three years. In my case, I have a son going to college in five years, which is terrifying. And you say, ""Boy, I'm going to need X amount of money."" You might take a job that you don't love because it pays better, knowing it's not forever. But even when you do that, you want to make sure that the skills you get from that job help you get to the one you want. So, if your goal is to get to a certain place, it's OK to detour for money or for schedule or whatever, but don't detour so far that you can never get back to where you're going. That's a very important thing to remember. And you really need to sit down and figure out how much you want to leave. There have been times when I've had jobs where I liked the job well enough, but I would be willing to apply for things that, if I got it, not only would it be awesome for me, but when I went in to tell my boss I was leaving, he or she would look at me and be like, ""Oh, yeah, of course. You're going to be a clown in the circus? You have to do that. Who wouldn't do that?""

And then there have been times when I've been at a job where I've applied for anything that would pay enough and get me out of the situation I was in, sometimes even if it was a bad job. And another area, and I've talked to my wife about this a lot over the years, she has a PhD, she works on nonprofits, that sometimes, if you like the people and there's things in an organization you eventually would like doing, it's OK to take a job that isn't the job you wanted. At times in her career, she's wanted to work at universities. And I've said to her, ""Well, they may not hire you as a professor, but if you're the grants administrator and you want to adjunct, you're going to have a much better chance of adjuncting than someone from the outside."" So, sometimes you make those decisions and just get your foot in the door. That's very true of government work, or at a big company like a Microsoft. Once you've been there a year, you get access to jobs before they go open to the public. You have to look and see if a company has a stigma about moving around, but a lot of them don't, or allow it after a certain period of time. So, you really have to set that bar of what's going to get you to move.

Lapera: Yeah. And I want to touch on something you said earlier, which is, you're at a job and you're applying for other jobs, and this is something to keep in mind -- it's way easier to get a job when you already have a job.

Kline: It is. It shouldn't be, but we said it before, there's just something about, you're more in demand. It's kind of like if you're in a relationship perhaps more people think you're attractive when you're out at a bar. That's probably a confidence issue. But that also comes through in job interviews for most people. And you have more salary flexibility when you're working, or your ability to say, ""Hey, I want four weeks vacation."" If you're unemployed, you get all vacation. So there's no negotiating point. It is important, though, to remember that a lot of industries are small, and as you apply for jobs, you want to be careful and discreet, and be aware if your boss is friends with her counterpart at the similar company down the road, maybe don't apply for a job there unless you're willing [to have] your boss find out.

Lapera: Yeah. Being discreet when you're applying for jobs when you already have a job, maybe don't apply for jobs when you're in your office.

Kline: Never use company resources to apply for jobs. Meaning, if you have a company laptop and they let you take it home, don't have your resume on it. Even if you can wipe it, all the things we can do to cover our tracks, don't print out your resume on the computer there. Don't use the fax machine. Because jobs are one of the only things ever that sometimes still require a fax, some very big companies still use that method. Don't use theirs. Go to Office Depot if you have to, because you probably don't have a fax machine at home.

Lapera: And if you don't have a computer, go to your local library.

Kline: [laughs] I've always heard that advice, but the computers at the local library are terrible.

Lapera: Yes, they are.

Kline: Go to a work facility where you can rent a computer, as expensive as that is. Go to a FedEx office. Honestly, you can buy a serviceable laptop for $150. Go buy a laptop.

Lapera: That's true.

Kline: Buy a printer. There's electronic faxes. But don't steal paper from your company. It's not just about leaving, it's also about how you leave. That's something we're going to talk about in the future.

Lapera: Actually, that's a great transition. Let's talk about [laughs] how to leave.

Kline: Sorry.

Lapera: No, I think we covered everything about finding a job, being discreet, thinking about what you want, networking, having a job while you look for a job. And if you do have some sort of gap in your work history -- like, I have three months where I did not work and I was not in school, so I went backpacking in Europe for three months.

Kline: And I think you want to address that on your resume. Luckily, as journalists, it's very easy to do one freelance assignment and say, ""Oh, yes, that six months I was out of work, no, I was freelancing.""

Lapera: Or say you took some time off to write the next great American novel. Just say you took that time and you were trying to do something with it and it didn't work out, so now you're looking for work.

Kline: Yeah. I think it's OK to have done the dream trip or something. Most employers, if you get that interview, they may ask, ""How come for four months, you didn't work?"" And if your answer is, ""Because I always wanted to walk through New Zealand,"" I don't think too many are going to go, ""Well, that's a waste of time. Why did you do that? You're not hired,"" unless you're in a field where you have to keep your skills current, where you'll also want to demonstrate, ""Yes, I did these things, but I still read the industry journals or kept up or took whatever tests were needed. But in general, be up front about things like that.

Lapera: Yeah. Don't lie-lie, just lie a little. [laughs]

Kline: It's funny. A company I used to work with hired an editor to replace a job my wife had actually left, and I was consulting with them a bit on it, and the person who got the job -- [who] has since left the job -- put on her resume that she had been freelancing, and the reality was she had a kid and she had done nothing other than parenting. Which, if she had said, it was a family owned company with multiple generations running it, their kids in positions -- she got the job, but she almost didn't because she was deceptive about it. If she had said, ""I took time off my career to raise my child,"" she probably would have got a pat on the back. So, honesty is generally the best policy. There's gray areas. If you're freelancing 50% of the time, but it wasn't intentional, it's just to pay the bills, it's OK to say, ""I spent that time freelancing, but I would really like to go back to an office setting."" If you're not really, don't! You'll get caught.

Lapera: Yeah. And it's OK not to share everything with an employer. Say you needed to take six months off because of some sort of embarrassing disease, just say, ""I needed to take some time off for my health."" You don't have to say everything that happened to you.

Kline: I think in general, you want to be careful with disclosing health things, because certainly while it's discriminatory to not hire someone because they had just gone through cancer, I'm sure women your age deal with discrimination if you walk into a job and say, ""Oh, I just got engaged,"" because a male boss of a certain age is going to think, ""Is she going to have a baby? Is she going to leave and I'm going to have to pay medical leave?"" In general, stuff you don't have to divulge, don't divulge it.

Lapera: Yeah. If they ask you, say something. If they don't, just don't say anything at all. Anyway, we've definitely gone off track.

Kline: Yes we have. So, how to quit.

Lapera: We'll do a future show about what to say about your resume. It even rhymes, so it's a perfect title. How to leave your job. You want to make sure that you leave well. That means a few different things. First and foremost, it means you want to leave without having burned any of your bridges.

Kline: The first thing is give proper notice. In many industries, proper notice is two weeks. In a few industries -- if you are a teacher, proper notice is the end of the school year. If there's a dire emergency, perhaps the turnover at Christmas time. But, if you're a doctor, there might be different rules. But in general, you should give whatever the standard notice is, and I'm not a fan of giving extra because you become a dead man walking and people stop inviting you to meetings and it just becomes very unpleasant. But two weeks in most cases is enough for them to figure out what you do. And, as you're leaving, one, do as good a job as you possibly can. Don't leave early, don't stop putting the extra effort in, and do whatever you can to make it easy for the company. Meaning, if that means on the weekend you have to write up a guide to what you do and all your passwords and all your different accounts -- there are probably 10 things you do, and three things I do, that our bosses have no idea that we do them.

Lapera: Probably, yeah.

Kline: So, sometimes it's important to have a hand-over document. Now, if you're on a line of 20 people who all do the same job, that's less necessary. And as you leave, just be upbeat about it. Don't make the people who are staying feel bad. It's OK to say to your coworkers, ""Yes, I got an exciting new opportunity."" But don't say, ""Oh, I can't wait to get out of this hellhole."" They have to stay.

Lapera: In a hellhole.

Kline: And you never know -- your boss might be the reason you're leaving, but if you start slacking off, your co-workers are the ones who are going to bear the brunt of that. And you never know when today's person who's three levels below you is going to be sitting across the desk deciding if you get the job. Or even, the phone call comes, ""Hey, I know you used to work at this place where so and so used to work, what was she like?""

Lapera: Oh, yeah. And that's happened to me in real life. I shared earlier with you that I worked for someone and I moved on to another place and he applied for a job there, and I was asked, ""What do you think of him?"" And I didn't even say anything particularly negative. I didn't discuss any of the actually really honestly awful things about him, but I was like, ""Oh, you know, he was a little bit hard to work with."" And that was enough to kill it.

Kline: You need to be as upbeat as possible, especially if the reason you're leaving isn't because the place is terrible. If you're leaving for a better opportunity or just because you need a change, it's fine if they get you a cake on your last day or whatever, but take co-workers you like to lunch. Make sure you plan drinks with people after work that you enjoy. Send your boss a thank-you note for your time there. Don't be over the top. Be yourself. But you want people to know you appreciate it, and you want to leave a good feeling, even if it's a bad work situation.

Lapera: Yeah. The other thing to think about is, this is while you're job-hunting, but also for future jobs, make sure that you leave in such a good way that you can always get a good reference, or at least someone to pick up the phone and say, ""Yes, they definitely worked here.""

Kline: Yeah. It's funny, we've written about this before, so many companies won't give references. But even a company that says, ""We won't give references,"" they all will legally verify employment, but they don't have to return that call. They could always not be at their desk. They could cause you real problems by simply avoiding a phone call for a few days, and then you don't get the job because maybe you lied on your resume about working there. So you really want to think about, even if it was a bad situation, if they're not bad people -- and if they are bad people, and it's dangerous, don't give two weeks' notice. Just leave. But if it's just not for you anymore, even if it's a very unpleasant two weeks, it's only two weeks. It's going to be over. So, upbeat, really respect everybody, and try to smile as you leave, even if the second you're out of there you're going to crack open a bottle of champagne and tell all your friends how terrible it was.

Lapera: Yeah.

Kline: One last thing, also -- social media is public, no matter how private you think it is. So, even if you only have family as your Facebook friends, don't on your last day post ""never have to go back to this dump with these jerks!"" And I'm cleaning up your language. But don't do that, because you never know how things might get out there or what searches might happen or who's going to get hacked. So, just, you can talk quietly with your friends, but keep it to that.

Lapera: Yeah, definitely. This was a really great show, I think, personally. [laughs]

Kline: [laughs] Well, we're both going to find out one way or another.

Lapera: Fair enough. But we talked about a lot of different interesting things. I wanted to close the show with kind of a fun question, well I don't know if this is fun, but let's talk about what your worst job ever was. Dan?

Kline: Well, I worked for a company that was bought by Playboy, and I didn't actually ever end up becoming a Playboy employee, but for about 90 days during the transition, I was back and forth to Chicago. And I don't know what they're like now, it's a very different company, but at the time, they were the most boring, awful place to work, where lawyers checked everything. So, I had this hip young internet company, they're buying us to be hip and young, and everything hit a brick wall. We went from, ""Think of an idea in the morning to get it up on the web in the afternoon,"" and this was the late 90s were that wasn't so simple, to everything had to go through so. And by the time it finally got approved, often it no longer made any sense. So, as a 10 year old boy, you think, ""Someday I'm going to work at Playboy! There will be naked models everywhere!"" There are not.

Lapera: It's full of lawyers instead.

Kline: It's full of lawyers, it's full of dress codes. And once again, that was 1999. I'm sure they're all lovely people and it's very different now, and there's probably now naked models everywhere, and it's the bacchanal you would expect it to be. But boy, going from an internet culture where you just did what felt right to a corporate culture was just a huge shock.

Lapera: Austin?

Austin Morgan: I haven't had a ton of jobs. This is my first job out of college. But, while I was in college, I worked about a month at a summer camp, it was elementary school age kids, and I got strep throat twice in the same month.

Lapera: Little kids are ... I don't know how to say this kindly, they're a cesspool. They're a cesspool for germs and disease. I like them, but they're dirty. [laughs]

Morgan: Yeah. So, that was probably the worst outcome I've got from a job.

Kline: To be fair, if this is his only job, he had to say that. He couldn't say this job.

Lapera: [laughs] That's true. That's part of leaving kindly. OK, I think it's my turn. I worked for a researcher where my job was to keep thousands upon thousands of fish alive, but I think the worst thing that we did, maybe the most interesting thing that we did, too, was we would show these fish horror movies. It was, like, fishy horror movies. So, we would make the fish watch other fish being eaten by fish, and then we would record their behavior. And we had this set up where they couldn't get away from the movie in the tank. They were forced to watch this snuff film, essentially.

Kline: What was the point of the research?

Lapera: We were studying their mating behavior. We can get into it later. But it was just, the constant drudgery of keeping these fish alive. They did not want to stay alive, mind you. They would jump out and hit you in the face with their little tails before plunging to their death below. And then, I realize that they're fish, it's not like showing children slasher films, but at the same time, you're like, ""I'm forcing another living being to watch the demise of another living being.""

Kline: Did the rate of fish suicide go up when you showed them the movies?

Lapera: No. Fish are not bright animals. And I like fish. I like to eat fish. I think fish are pretty. Which is maybe one of the dumber things I've said in the last couple of weeks. And not to put down people who really enjoy fish, but this was just not a great job.

Kline: Are you sure this was a real scientist?

Lapera: It was a real scientist. She had government funding and everything. She was very respected in her field. It was just not the job for me. It was just drudgery. But someone had to keep those fish alive, and I was one of those people.

Lapera: Probably not. Also, I have so many funny stories from that job. But we'll save that for another time. Thank you everyone for listening. I shut my computer, and you would think I had this memorized by now but I don't. Here we go.

1,1,"It's not always an easy decision, and in most cases you should do some planning first, but there are times when you're doing the right thing by quitting your job.

Sometimes it's time to move on. And while sometimes that's obvious -- like when your work environment is downright dangerous or toxic -- sometimes we can get lulled into staying somewhere we really ought to move on from because it's comfortable.

In this week's episode of Industry Focus: Financials, host Gaby Lapera and Motley Fool contributor Dan Kline explain how to know when it's time to move on from your job. Then the cast looks at how to find a new job while you're still working at your old job, how to network, how and why to leave your old job gracefully and tactfully, how honest you'll want to be about your resume -- spoilers: pretty honest -- when it's appropriate to take any position to get your foot in the door and when you'll want to avoid that, and more.

Gaby Lapera: Hello everyone! Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. You're listening to the Financials edition, taped on Thursday, August 3rd, 2017. My name is Gaby Lapera, and joining me in the studio is Dan Kline, one of my favorite writers here at The Motley Fool and jack of all trades. Hello, Dan!

Dan Kline: Hello and thank you! I didn't know that. Top ten or top 100?

Lapera: I'm not going to tell you, and also don't tell the other writers. [laughs]

Kline: Well, you can be quite sure that none of the other writers ever watch a podcast they're not on.

Lapera: Fair enough. So, this show is pre-taped. I have no idea when it's going to go out, so if there's some sort of huge financial news that I'm ignoring, it's not on purpose. I'm probably sick or on vacation. I promise I'll cover it when I get back next week. But I bet Motley Fool Money or Market Foolery has said something about it in the meantime. Anyway, turning to our show today, I don't know if you guys remember, but Dan and I did a careers-based show a while back. I don't know how far back, because I don't know when you're listening to this.

Kline: Fourth of July, basically.

Lapera: Over Fourth of July. It was really great, and we got a lot of really good feedback about it, so I invited Dan back again. We're going to talk about two main topics today, one of which is how do you know when it's time to leave a job, and how to find a job when you already have one, and how to leave gracefully. So, those are the two big topics. How to know when to leave a job, I know it varies from person to person but there's a few big things. You see the writing on the wall.

Kline: Yeah. I think the big thing is, people get very scared. They have a job, they're getting a paycheck, they have health insurance, all the things they need.

Lapera: Oh, I love health insurance.

Kline: And they don't think about happiness. You're not going to walk in and quit your job when your job is good enough. But you should start thinking about it. You should start looking. You say ""the writing is on the wall,"" and that can mean a few different things. Maybe you're up for a promotion and you don't get it. Maybe there's just no place to go. You're looking and you're saying, ""I could do this job for the next 20 years. Boy, I would have to do this job for the next 20 years."" And you should think about those things, and not be afraid to open your eyes. It doesn't mean you storm into the boss' office and quit, it doesn't mean you leave Friday and don't come back on Monday. But you should be open to the idea, even though that can be terrifying.

Lapera: Definitely. To circle back around to reasons you might want to quit, but you're not in a huge hurry to quit, like you said, having health insurance is great. But I don't know, you look around the company and you see that maybe there are money issues, and maybe you're worried about the future of the company. You don't think it's going to go bankrupt tomorrow, but you're not really sure if they're going to be around in 10 years.

Kline: What you don't want to be, and I've worked at companies that have run out of money, I've worked at companies that have been teetering. I came up through the internet age, where I worked at a very large internet company that went through something like $80 million in two years.

Lapera: God.

Kline: Which was normal back then. You didn't make money, but you might in the future. None of those companies exist anymore. But if you're working at a company and you start to see things like your direct deposit is two days late, or if you still get a physical check, which I think only about 30% of Americans do, but you still get a physical check and you have to race to the bank because the exact amount is in the account, those are things when you start looking. If you work even with just a handful of people and the company does go out of business, you don't want to be the sixth person from that company who's sending out a resume. So there are situations where you want to get ahead of it. And sometimes it's quality of life. You might have a job you like and your boss leaves, and the new boss, it might not even be a person who's mean, it just might be a style that you don't like, or your talents and their talents are too close together so you don't have the autonomy you once did. It's OK to leave your job because you don't love your job anymore.

Lapera: Yeah, definitely. I will put in a plug that if you work in a toxic work environment, probably time to find a new job.

Kline: Sure. We've written about this a lot. There are a few scenarios where you can leave your job and not give notice, and one of them is if it's dangerous. If you're working for a boss who's saying things like, ""Yeah, I know you think driving 10 hours a day is enough, but I really need you in California tomorrow, so drive straight through until you get there,"" that may not be a safe scenario.

Lapera: Any place where OSHA requirements are being ignored, maybe leave. And I'm not talking about, ""Oh, I stood up on my spinny chair to change a lightbulb because maintenance wasn't fast enough.""

Kline: See, my family is in the ladder business, that kind of stuff drives me insane. That's a good example, if you work someplace where they don't have the proper tools and they ask you to do dangerous things, and you have to judge that for yourself. Maybe standing on that chair to change a lightbulb that's six feet in the air doesn't seem that scary. But if they have an eight foot ladder for a job that needs a 12 foot ladder and you're standing on the top step that says ""not a step,"" which is my email address, if you see an email from me, that's time to go. And other situations -- if you're being sexually harassed, if you're being threatened. But those are not the biggest scenarios. Obviously, they happen. And it's really more of a case of, you have to evaluate. You have to look at your job, and when you stop wanting to get up in the morning ... not all of us can say, ""OK, I don't like this anymore, now I'm done,"" because we still need money and we like to eat. But that's when you can start being open to other things beyond just, ""Yeah, I look at the classifieds for my industry, whatever internet form that takes, and if the dream job was out there, maybe I would apply."" Maybe you start looking at things that would be lateral moves just to shake up your life a little bit.

Lapera: That's actually a really good point. If you get super comfortable at a job, and you look around and you're like, ""What am I doing with my life?""

Kline: Look, there's times in your life, and I'm older than you, as I'm sure anybody watching this can tell, when my son was born -- he's 13 now -- I specifically took jobs based on that I could not be a newspaper editor and have a newborn at home. You can't have a 02:00 AM deadline every night and also be a decent parent. I'm sure people have done it. I don't want to insult anyone who has. But it wasn't going to work for me. So I took a job in my family business in the construction area where very rarely did customers ever need me at night. It was a 07:00 AM to 04:00 PM kind of job. And after two years, I was good at it, and I was looking around going, ""What am I doing with my life? I'm an editor and I'm a writer,"" but I had to wait until my son was a little older and I could move on. So, sometimes boring is OK. But if you don't have those impediments, if you don't have things in your life or reasons -- maybe you have a health issue and you don't want to risk any change in coverage, or something. If those aren't there, life should be exciting. We work a lot. I don't know about you, but 07:00 AM to 05:00 PM can be normal for me. I see that you guys are on, you edit things of mine at 11:00 at night.

Lapera: Yeah, I'm a little bit more of a night owl. That's my issue. So, I get to work late, but then I'm also at work late.

Kline: Yeah. And if you like your work, I think that's great. I'm sure getting to read stories I've written at 11:00 at night is basically like a new show premiering on Netflix, I'm sure it's delightful.

Lapera: Definitely, it's scintillating, I just can't look away.

Kline: But if you don't feel that way ... and maybe it's simple. Maybe the co-workers you had lunch with have all moved on, and the parts you enjoyed about your day have just become drudgery. You can leave. In most cases, you have more value than you think you do. And it's generally easier to get a job when you have a job, as opposed to being unemployed, you become a little bit tainted in the eyes of the people doing the hiring.

Lapera: No, definitely. I think, there's nothing wrong with being comfortable. There's some people who really love their jobs, and they could go into work every day and do the exact same thing for 20 years. And that's awesome. I think that's incredible. I'm not one of those people.

Kline: Neither am I. This is the longest I've ever been working for the same company. But what's interesting about what we do here at Fool, especially those of us who are work from home writers, is that you can make the job whatever you want it to be. So, I work on these podcasts sometimes, I do other special projects. Nobody ever calls and asks you, most of the time, ""Hey, would you like to be involved in a special project?"" You usually have to stand up. So, sometimes it isn't leaving your job. Sometimes it's going to your boss or other people in the company and saying, ""Things are a little stagnant for me, boy I would love to learn this department, we should be in this field."" So you don't always have to leave to leave. You might transfer. You might just create new little wrinkles in your job. It's something you've done here bunch of times.

Lapera: Definitely. Yeah, like, podcast, I was originally not allowed to do that, and now here I am because Kristine hated the financial sector. She used to do this podcast, actually. And just a quick point about that, there are good and bad ways to ask to do new things. A bad way would be going to your boss and saying, ""Hey, man, I'm super bored and I hate my job now! Fix it!"" [laughs]

Kline: You have to approach everything as a positive. There's one major caveat to this. You cannot go to your boss and ask for new responsibilities or even different responsibilities if you're not doing your job well. So, it's very important, when you get bored, to not let that leak into your performance. So if you're someone who's always eager in meetings, and over the course of time becomes someone who sits in the back and doesn't participate, that's going to be noticed. And if it has happened, you need to address it. You need to go to your boss and say, ""Here's what's happening, here's why, I'm going to correct this, but I would also like to move into these areas."" But if you've done a good job, then you point it out to your boss. And sometimes it is, ""I'll do this extra, I'll take this on on the side to see if we can create revenue, momentum, a reason for this to exist."" And we've seen that here at Fool over and over again. You and I both work on the Careers content, which is a relatively new -- which is why we're talking today -- area for us. And we've tried lots of different experiments, and they don't all work. [laughs]

Lapera: Oh, yeah.

Kline: But it's delightful when one does work, and it becomes something we do. And I think, if you work in an office and you have a well laid-out plan that isn't a huge expenditure, and you walk into your boss and your boss just wants things to be exactly as they are, well that tells you a lot about your job and your future and whether you want to be there or not. So, that might be a sign where you say, ""OK, I've tried here, and now it's time to go.""

Lapera: Definitely. Just to recap a little bit: reasons that you might want to leave your job. Maybe not a bad work environment, but a boring work environment where there's not a lot of opportunity.

Kline: You've done it all.

Lapera: You've just done it all, and there may be no opportunity to progress or do anything new. Maybe you've been passed over for a promotion, and there's no more opportunity for promotion. Or maybe you just don't like who you're working for. It's not horrible, but you just don't like them very much.

Kline: We're not really talking today about obvious situations, where they made you take a pay cut so you're going to quit, or something terrible has happened. These are just sort of the [groans]. And when life becomes [groans], then it's time to pack up your desk.

Lapera: I'm going to love seeing how the transcriptionist writes that noise. Sorry. [laughs]

Kline: Hey, if they could handle the singing on Answers, I'm pretty sure they'll be able to figure that out.

Lapera: OK, let's turn to our second topic, which is actually leaving a job. Again, we're still talking about a job that you find tolerable, but maybe not life-affirming. And not all jobs are life-affirming, I know that. I've had plenty of non life-affirming jobs. But you're getting ready to look for a new job. What are some of the things that you should keep in mind?

Kline: First of all, if you have a job and you're not going to be there for 30 years -- if you're a school teacher or nurse and that's what you do, and your goal is to stay in the same place, these things may not be as important. But most people, when they take a job, go in with the idea that it's probably not the rest of their life. Networking is the most important thing. And I don't just mean big ticket, like, ""I'm going to go to the industry trade show and meet the president of so and so!""

Lapera: But you should do that.

Kline: You should do that. But I mean, really going through your LinkedIn contacts, your Facebook, your Rolodex, which I know isn't a thing anymore, and you probably think it's the candy with the caramel inside. But no, your Rolodex is your contacts, everybody you know. And think, ""Hey, does my former intern now work someplace where she could put in a word for me? Does my mother's friend have a contact?"" And the important thing to do is, you want to warm up those relationships, because you don't want to just be the person who, after three years of no contact, emails someone and says, ""Can I have a favor?"" So, that might be as simple as just interacting with them on Facebook by putting a comment on their photo of their dog, or whatever it is.

Lapera: Yeah, asking them out for coffee.

Kline: Yeah, asking them out for coffee. Just having them know who you are in a way beyond, when you ask them for the favor, you have to email them and say, ""You may remember me from three years ago when I was your intern supervisor,"" or whatever it is. But you really should look to everyone out there. And if you don't have the contacts, let's say you really want to change professions, you're working in one area, go meet the people that are necessary.

Lapera: And this really isn't that hard. I think a lot of people get really intimidated by this idea that you can literally just email someone and be like, ""Hey, I would love to work in,"" this actually happened to me a couple months ago, ""I would love to work in online media. Can I grab lunch with you?"" And I was not particularly interested in meeting this person, but they were a friend of friend, and I was like, ""Sure, you know what, let's grab coffee instead,"" because that's less of a commitment. But I was happy to help out this person that I had never talked to in my entire life.

Kline: It happens to me all the time, because parents gets scared, their kids are in year three of communications school, they're getting a degree that doesn't correspond to a job. And sometimes it's just helping them talk it out. I have a very good friend whose son was in the financials space making really good money and he wanted to work in sports journalism. So we sat down and talked it out and we talked about [how] a lot of radio hosts are also the sales director. So, you have all this business experience -- he's actually a producer for Sirius XM now, of business shows. So he's not quite in sports, but he's closer to what he wants to do, and he's in radio, which is something. So, it really is, most people like to be a hero. That's a phrase you'll see me use in articles a lot, we've talked about it here. If you contact someone and you go have coffee and you say, ""Yeah, I really need a foot in the door here,"" somebody somewhere down the line is going to ask them, ""Do you know an entry-level person? I need an assistant, I need a part-timer, ""or whatever it is. And they might go, ""Oh, yeah, I do know someone."" And that's how you get your foot in the door. And it might be your way out from a situation you're not that happy in.

Lapera: Definitely. I think the other thing to think about when you're looking for work is you need to think about what you want to do, and you need to think, what are the things you're looking for in a job that will make you happy? Or that you really need in your life? You mentioned having a set schedule so you could pick up your son from day care, or whatever it was. Or maybe you just graduated from law school and you have a ton of debt, and you're like, ""I'm going to work for a law firm that I don't really like for a little bit because they have a lot of money.""

Kline: Yeah. You sort of need to make your pie chart of priorities. And they're going to change. There might be points in your life where, pretend two years from now you're getting married, and you and your future spouse are sitting down and you want to buy a house in three years. In my case, I have a son going to college in five years, which is terrifying. And you say, ""Boy, I'm going to need X amount of money."" You might take a job that you don't love because it pays better, knowing it's not forever. But even when you do that, you want to make sure that the skills you get from that job help you get to the one you want. So, if your goal is to get to a certain place, it's OK to detour for money or for schedule or whatever, but don't detour so far that you can never get back to where you're going. That's a very important thing to remember. And you really need to sit down and figure out how much you want to leave. There have been times when I've had jobs where I liked the job well enough, but I would be willing to apply for things that, if I got it, not only would it be awesome for me, but when I went in to tell my boss I was leaving, he or she would look at me and be like, ""Oh, yeah, of course. You're going to be a clown in the circus? You have to do that. Who wouldn't do that?""

And then there have been times when I've been at a job where I've applied for anything that would pay enough and get me out of the situation I was in, sometimes even if it was a bad job. And another area, and I've talked to my wife about this a lot over the years, she has a PhD, she works on nonprofits, that sometimes, if you like the people and there's things in an organization you eventually would like doing, it's OK to take a job that isn't the job you wanted. At times in her career, she's wanted to work at universities. And I've said to her, ""Well, they may not hire you as a professor, but if you're the grants administrator and you want to adjunct, you're going to have a much better chance of adjuncting than someone from the outside."" So, sometimes you make those decisions and just get your foot in the door. That's very true of government work, or at a big company like a Microsoft. Once you've been there a year, you get access to jobs before they go open to the public. You have to look and see if a company has a stigma about moving around, but a lot of them don't, or allow it after a certain period of time. So, you really have to set that bar of what's going to get you to move.

Lapera: Yeah. And I want to touch on something you said earlier, which is, you're at a job and you're applying for other jobs, and this is something to keep in mind -- it's way easier to get a job when you already have a job.

Kline: It is. It shouldn't be, but we said it before, there's just something about, you're more in demand. It's kind of like if you're in a relationship perhaps more people think you're attractive when you're out at a bar. That's probably a confidence issue. But that also comes through in job interviews for most people. And you have more salary flexibility when you're working, or your ability to say, ""Hey, I want four weeks vacation."" If you're unemployed, you get all vacation. So there's no negotiating point. It is important, though, to remember that a lot of industries are small, and as you apply for jobs, you want to be careful and discreet, and be aware if your boss is friends with her counterpart at the similar company down the road, maybe don't apply for a job there unless you're willing [to have] your boss find out.

Lapera: Yeah. Being discreet when you're applying for jobs when you already have a job, maybe don't apply for jobs when you're in your office.

Kline: Never use company resources to apply for jobs. Meaning, if you have a company laptop and they let you take it home, don't have your resume on it. Even if you can wipe it, all the things we can do to cover our tracks, don't print out your resume on the computer there. Don't use the fax machine. Because jobs are one of the only things ever that sometimes still require a fax, some very big companies still use that method. Don't use theirs. Go to Office Depot if you have to, because you probably don't have a fax machine at home.

Lapera: And if you don't have a computer, go to your local library.

Kline: [laughs] I've always heard that advice, but the computers at the local library are terrible.

Lapera: Yes, they are.

Kline: Go to a work facility where you can rent a computer, as expensive as that is. Go to a FedEx office. Honestly, you can buy a serviceable laptop for $150. Go buy a laptop.

Lapera: That's true.

Kline: Buy a printer. There's electronic faxes. But don't steal paper from your company. It's not just about leaving, it's also about how you leave. That's something we're going to talk about in the future.

Lapera: Actually, that's a great transition. Let's talk about [laughs] how to leave.

Kline: Sorry.

Lapera: No, I think we covered everything about finding a job, being discreet, thinking about what you want, networking, having a job while you look for a job. And if you do have some sort of gap in your work history -- like, I have three months where I did not work and I was not in school, so I went backpacking in Europe for three months.

Kline: And I think you want to address that on your resume. Luckily, as journalists, it's very easy to do one freelance assignment and say, ""Oh, yes, that six months I was out of work, no, I was freelancing.""

Lapera: Or say you took some time off to write the next great American novel. Just say you took that time and you were trying to do something with it and it didn't work out, so now you're looking for work.

Kline: Yeah. I think it's OK to have done the dream trip or something. Most employers, if you get that interview, they may ask, ""How come for four months, you didn't work?"" And if your answer is, ""Because I always wanted to walk through New Zealand,"" I don't think too many are going to go, ""Well, that's a waste of time. Why did you do that? You're not hired,"" unless you're in a field where you have to keep your skills current, where you'll also want to demonstrate, ""Yes, I did these things, but I still read the industry journals or kept up or took whatever tests were needed. But in general, be up front about things like that.

Lapera: Yeah. Don't lie-lie, just lie a little. [laughs]

Kline: It's funny. A company I used to work with hired an editor to replace a job my wife had actually left, and I was consulting with them a bit on it, and the person who got the job -- [who] has since left the job -- put on her resume that she had been freelancing, and the reality was she had a kid and she had done nothing other than parenting. Which, if she had said, it was a family owned company with multiple generations running it, their kids in positions -- she got the job, but she almost didn't because she was deceptive about it. If she had said, ""I took time off my career to raise my child,"" she probably would have got a pat on the back. So, honesty is generally the best policy. There's gray areas. If you're freelancing 50% of the time, but it wasn't intentional, it's just to pay the bills, it's OK to say, ""I spent that time freelancing, but I would really like to go back to an office setting."" If you're not really, don't! You'll get caught.

Lapera: Yeah. And it's OK not to share everything with an employer. Say you needed to take six months off because of some sort of embarrassing disease, just say, ""I needed to take some time off for my health."" You don't have to say everything that happened to you.

Kline: I think in general, you want to be careful with disclosing health things, because certainly while it's discriminatory to not hire someone because they had just gone through cancer, I'm sure women your age deal with discrimination if you walk into a job and say, ""Oh, I just got engaged,"" because a male boss of a certain age is going to think, ""Is she going to have a baby? Is she going to leave and I'm going to have to pay medical leave?"" In general, stuff you don't have to divulge, don't divulge it.

Lapera: Yeah. If they ask you, say something. If they don't, just don't say anything at all. Anyway, we've definitely gone off track.

Kline: Yes we have. So, how to quit.

Lapera: We'll do a future show about what to say about your resume. It even rhymes, so it's a perfect title. How to leave your job. You want to make sure that you leave well. That means a few different things. First and foremost, it means you want to leave without having burned any of your bridges.

Kline: The first thing is give proper notice. In many industries, proper notice is two weeks. In a few industries -- if you are a teacher, proper notice is the end of the school year. If there's a dire emergency, perhaps the turnover at Christmas time. But, if you're a doctor, there might be different rules. But in general, you should give whatever the standard notice is, and I'm not a fan of giving extra because you become a dead man walking and people stop inviting you to meetings and it just becomes very unpleasant. But two weeks in most cases is enough for them to figure out what you do. And, as you're leaving, one, do as good a job as you possibly can. Don't leave early, don't stop putting the extra effort in, and do whatever you can to make it easy for the company. Meaning, if that means on the weekend you have to write up a guide to what you do and all your passwords and all your different accounts -- there are probably 10 things you do, and three things I do, that our bosses have no idea that we do them.

Lapera: Probably, yeah.

Kline: So, sometimes it's important to have a hand-over document. Now, if you're on a line of 20 people who all do the same job, that's less necessary. And as you leave, just be upbeat about it. Don't make the people who are staying feel bad. It's OK to say to your coworkers, ""Yes, I got an exciting new opportunity."" But don't say, ""Oh, I can't wait to get out of this hellhole."" They have to stay.

Lapera: In a hellhole.

Kline: And you never know -- your boss might be the reason you're leaving, but if you start slacking off, your co-workers are the ones who are going to bear the brunt of that. And you never know when today's person who's three levels below you is going to be sitting across the desk deciding if you get the job. Or even, the phone call comes, ""Hey, I know you used to work at this place where so and so used to work, what was she like?""

Lapera: Oh, yeah. And that's happened to me in real life. I shared earlier with you that I worked for someone and I moved on to another place and he applied for a job there, and I was asked, ""What do you think of him?"" And I didn't even say anything particularly negative. I didn't discuss any of the actually really honestly awful things about him, but I was like, ""Oh, you know, he was a little bit hard to work with."" And that was enough to kill it.

Kline: You need to be as upbeat as possible, especially if the reason you're leaving isn't because the place is terrible. If you're leaving for a better opportunity or just because you need a change, it's fine if they get you a cake on your last day or whatever, but take co-workers you like to lunch. Make sure you plan drinks with people after work that you enjoy. Send your boss a thank-you note for your time there. Don't be over the top. Be yourself. But you want people to know you appreciate it, and you want to leave a good feeling, even if it's a bad work situation.

Lapera: Yeah. The other thing to think about is, this is while you're job-hunting, but also for future jobs, make sure that you leave in such a good way that you can always get a good reference, or at least someone to pick up the phone and say, ""Yes, they definitely worked here.""

Kline: Yeah. It's funny, we've written about this before, so many companies won't give references. But even a company that says, ""We won't give references,"" they all will legally verify employment, but they don't have to return that call. They could always not be at their desk. They could cause you real problems by simply avoiding a phone call for a few days, and then you don't get the job because maybe you lied on your resume about working there. So you really want to think about, even if it was a bad situation, if they're not bad people -- and if they are bad people, and it's dangerous, don't give two weeks' notice. Just leave. But if it's just not for you anymore, even if it's a very unpleasant two weeks, it's only two weeks. It's going to be over. So, upbeat, really respect everybody, and try to smile as you leave, even if the second you're out of there you're going to crack open a bottle of champagne and tell all your friends how terrible it was.

Lapera: Yeah.

Kline: One last thing, also -- social media is public, no matter how private you think it is. So, even if you only have family as your Facebook friends, don't on your last day post ""never have to go back to this dump with these jerks!"" And I'm cleaning up your language. But don't do that, because you never know how things might get out there or what searches might happen or who's going to get hacked. So, just, you can talk quietly with your friends, but keep it to that.

Lapera: Yeah, definitely. This was a really great show, I think, personally. [laughs]

Kline: [laughs] Well, we're both going to find out one way or another.

Lapera: Fair enough. But we talked about a lot of different interesting things. I wanted to close the show with kind of a fun question, well I don't know if this is fun, but let's talk about what your worst job ever was. Dan?

Kline: Well, I worked for a company that was bought by Playboy, and I didn't actually ever end up becoming a Playboy employee, but for about 90 days during the transition, I was back and forth to Chicago. And I don't know what they're like now, it's a very different company, but at the time, they were the most boring, awful place to work, where lawyers checked everything. So, I had this hip young internet company, they're buying us to be hip and young, and everything hit a brick wall. We went from, ""Think of an idea in the morning to get it up on the web in the afternoon,"" and this was the late 90s were that wasn't so simple, to everything had to go through so. And by the time it finally got approved, often it no longer made any sense. So, as a 10 year old boy, you think, ""Someday I'm going to work at Playboy! There will be naked models everywhere!"" There are not.

Lapera: It's full of lawyers instead.

Kline: It's full of lawyers, it's full of dress codes. And once again, that was 1999. I'm sure they're all lovely people and it's very different now, and there's probably now naked models everywhere, and it's the bacchanal you would expect it to be. But boy, going from an internet culture where you just did what felt right to a corporate culture was just a huge shock.

Lapera: Austin?

Austin Morgan: I haven't had a ton of jobs. This is my first job out of college. But, while I was in college, I worked about a month at a summer camp, it was elementary school age kids, and I got strep throat twice in the same month.

Lapera: Little kids are ... I don't know how to say this kindly, they're a cesspool. They're a cesspool for germs and disease. I like them, but they're dirty. [laughs]

Morgan: Yeah. So, that was probably the worst outcome I've got from a job.

Kline: To be fair, if this is his only job, he had to say that. He couldn't say this job.

Lapera: [laughs] That's true. That's part of leaving kindly. OK, I think it's my turn. I worked for a researcher where my job was to keep thousands upon thousands of fish alive, but I think the worst thing that we did, maybe the most interesting thing that we did, too, was we would show these fish horror movies. It was, like, fishy horror movies. So, we would make the fish watch other fish being eaten by fish, and then we would record their behavior. And we had this set up where they couldn't get away from the movie in the tank. They were forced to watch this snuff film, essentially.

Kline: What was the point of the research?

Lapera: We were studying their mating behavior. We can get into it later. But it was just, the constant drudgery of keeping these fish alive. They did not want to stay alive, mind you. They would jump out and hit you in the face with their little tails before plunging to their death below. And then, I realize that they're fish, it's not like showing children slasher films, but at the same time, you're like, ""I'm forcing another living being to watch the demise of another living being.""

Kline: Did the rate of fish suicide go up when you showed them the movies?

Lapera: No. Fish are not bright animals. And I like fish. I like to eat fish. I think fish are pretty. Which is maybe one of the dumber things I've said in the last couple of weeks. And not to put down people who really enjoy fish, but this was just not a great job.

Kline: Are you sure this was a real scientist?

Lapera: It was a real scientist. She had government funding and everything. She was very respected in her field. It was just not the job for me. It was just drudgery. But someone had to keep those fish alive, and I was one of those people.

Lapera: Probably not. Also, I have so many funny stories from that job. But we'll save that for another time. Thank you everyone for listening. I shut my computer, and you would think I had this memorized by now but I don't. Here we go. As usual, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks -- or quit your job -- based solely on what you hear. Contact us at industryfocus@fool.com or by tweeting us @MFIndustryFocus and let us know what your worst job was. Thank you to Austin Morgan, today's totally rad producer, and thank you to Dan Kline for joining me in the studio.

Kline: Thank you for having me!

Lapera: Always a pleasure! Alright everyone, have a great, excellent week in the future sometime!"
2,2,"Olmsted Medical Center is in the midst of a leadership transition where three key veterans -- all women -- with 102 years of combined experience will be replaced by the end of the year.

Last week, OMC posted job openings that include three key pieces of its leadership team. They include the chief information officer, chief operational officer and chief nursing officer due to the death of Sue Schuett and impending retirements of Lois Till-Tarara and Sue Klenner.

They account for 33 percent of the nine-member leadership team that's led by President Kathryn Lombardo.

The trio of Rochester natives started at the company when it was still known as Olmsted Medical Group and played key roles in its transformative growth -- alongside Mayo Clinic -- in recent decades. The Rochester-based facility that opened in 1949 now includes 10 satellite clinics across Southeast Minnesota, with another partnership starting soon in Lake City.

OMC had 29 physicians when Schuett started in 1980 and just 220 employees when Till-Tarara was hired seven years later. It now boasts 160 clinicians and more than 1,200 other employees.

The women played critical roles in expansion, implementing OMC's electronic health records system, creating award-winning patient safety protocols and planning the $25 million women's health pavilion that opened three years ago in Southeast Rochester, among other things.

""Their respective professional guidance and support that each have provided me during my tenure has been immeasurable, and I am grateful,"" said Tim Weir, OMC's CEO who has worked with the women for the past 12 years. ""I will personally miss their institutional wisdom, but more importantly their friendship.

""We are fortunate to have been aware of their retirements for an extended period of time and are confident that we have the depth of management skill necessary as we recruit for these positions.""

Schuett rose through the ranks during her 36-year career at OMC, ultimately filling the role of chief information officer. Sorensen credited her with impacting ""all aspects of our health care delivery system"" while displaying ""diplomacy and tenacity"" that made her an institutional asset in every role.

However, pancreatic cancer forced Schuett into early retirement. She died Feb. 10, a month after retirement, and her position has been filled on an interim basis since then.

Till-Tarara and Klenner both lauded their longtime colleague's dedication, noting Schuett volunteered to lead OMC's Customer Service Excellence initiative and worked throughout her lengthy battle with cancer.

Her death was a blow as they already were eyeing retirement, said Till-Tarara, a Lourdes grad who has spent 30 years with the organization. She plans to retire at the end of 2017.

""I've had a good ride ... but I want to do things that don't involve meetings and computers,"" said Till-Tarara, who spent the last decade as OMC's vice president of clinical operations. ""We live in the country, and I love to garden, weld, split wood and some of that physical kind of activity. With us losing a colleague, that makes you reconsider your priorities.""

Klenner plans to step away Jan. 5 from her dual role as chief nursing officer and vice president of patient care. She pointed to OMC being recognized by Minnesota Hospital Association for patient safety and her role as co-chair of the women's health pavilion as highlights of her 36-year tenure.

She plans to transition into retirement in order to spend more time with family, which now includes four grandkids.

Till-Tarara and Klenner are prepared to train their replacements as they begin the daunting task of cleaning out their adjoining offices. They both expressed confidence that Weir and others at OMC won't skip a beat without them.

""It's the people and the general culture at Olmsted Medical Center,"" Klenner said. ""I have just a huge amount of respect for the staff and administration and the direction of the organization. It's always been the right fit for me. But I'm very content with my decision. The timing is right for me, and I'm looking forward to passing the torch.""

Added Till-Tarara: ""It's kind of bittersweet. It's been a wonderful place to work. It's hard to give that up."""
3,3,"Artificial intelligence - commonly known as A.I. - is already exceeding human abilities. Self-driving cars use A.I. to perform some tasks more safely than people. E-commerce companies use A.I. to tailor product ads to customers' tastes quicker and with more precision than any breathing marketing analyst.

And, soon, A.I. will be used to ""read"" biomedical images more accurately than medical personnel alone - providing better early cervical cancer detection at lower cost than current methods.

However, this does not necessarily mean radiologists will soon be out of business.

""Humans and computers are very complementary,"" says Sharon Xiaolei Huang, associate professor of computer science and engineering at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA. ""That's what A.I. is all about.""

Huang directs the Image Data Emulation & Analysis Laboratory at Lehigh where she works on artificial intelligence related to vision and graphics, or, as she says: ""creating techniques that enable computers to understand images the way humans do."" Among Huang's primary interests is training computers to understand biomedical images.

Now, as a result of 10 years work, Huang and her team have created a cervical cancer screening technique that, based on an analysis of a very large dataset, has the potential to perform as well or better than human interpretation on other traditional screening results, such as Pap tests and HPV tests - at a much lower cost. The technique could be used in less-developed countries, where 80% of deaths from cervical cancer occur.

The researchers are currently seeking funding for the next step in their project, which is to conduct clinical trials using this data-driven detection method.

A more accurate screening tool, at lower cost

Huang's screening system is built on image-based classifiers (an algorithm that classifies data) constructed from a large number of Cervigram images. Cervigrams are images taken by digital cervicography, a noninvasive visual examination method that takes a photograph of the cervix. The images, when read, are designed to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which is the potentially precancerous change and abnormal growth of squamous cells on the surface of the cervix.

""Cervigrams have great potential as a screening tool in resource-poor regions where clinical tests such as Pap and HPV are too expensive to be made widely available,"" says Huang. ""However, there is concern about Cervigrams' overall effectiveness due to reports of poor correlation between visual lesion recognition and high-grade disease, as well as disagreement among experts when grading visual findings.""

Huang thought that computer algorithms could help improve accuracy in grading lesions using visual information - a suspicion that, so far, is proving correct.

Because Huang's technique has been shown, via an analysis of the very large dataset, to be both more sensitive - able to detect abnormality - as well as more specific (fewer false positives), it could be used to improve cervical cancer screening in developed countries like the U.S.

""Our method would be an effective low-cost addition to a battery of tests helping to lower the false positive rate since it provides 10% better sensitivity and specificity than any other screening method, including Pap and HPV tests,"" says Huang.

Correlating visual features and patient data to cancer

To identify the characteristics that are most helpful in screening for cancer, the team created hand-crafted pyramid features (basic components of recognition systems) - as well as investigated the performance of a common deep learning framework known as convolutional neural networks (CNN) for cervical disease classification.

They describe their results in an article in Pattern Recognition called: ""Multi-feature based benchmark for cervical dysplasia classification evaluation."" The researchers have also released the multi-feature dataset and extensive evaluations using seven classic classifiers here.

To build the screening tool, Huang and her team used data from 1,112 patient visits, where 345 of the patients were found to have lesions that were positive for moderate or severe dysplasia (considered high-grade and likely to develop into cancer) and 767 had lesions that were negative (considered low-grade with mild dysplasia typically cleared by the immune system).

These data were selected from a large medical archive collected by the U.S. National Cancer Institute consisting of information from 10,000 anonymized women who were screened using multiple methods, including Cervigrams, over a number of visits. The data also contains the diagnosis and outcome for each patient.

""The program we've created automatically segments tissue regions seen in photos of the cervix, correlating visual features from the images to the development of precancerous lesions,"" says Huang. ""In practice, this could mean that medical staff analyzing a new patient's Cervigram could retrieve data about similar cases--not only in terms of optics, but also pathology since the dataset contains information about the outcomes of women at various stages of pathology.""

From the study: ""...with respect to accuracy and sensitivity, our hand-crafted PLBP-PLAB-PHOG feature descriptor with random forest classifier (RF.PLBP-PLAB-PHOG) outperforms every single Pap test or HPV test, when achieving a specificity of 90%. When not constrained by the 90% specificity requirement, our image-based classifier can achieve even better overall accuracy. For example, our fine-tuned CNN features with Softmax classifier can achieve an accuracy of 78.41% with 80.87% sensitivity and 75.94% specificity at the default probability threshold 0.5. Consequently, on this dataset, our lower-cost image-based classifiers can perform comparably or better than human interpretation based on widely-used Pap and HPV tests...""

According to the researchers, their classifiers achieve higher sensitivity in a particularly important area: detecting moderate and severe dysplasia - or cancer.

Exploring classification with improved imaging technique

Among Huang's other projects is a collaboration with Chao Zhou, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Lehigh. They are working on the use of an established medical imaging technique called optical coherence microscopy (OCM) - most commonly used in ophthalmology - to analyze breast tissue to produce computer-aided diagnoses. Their analysis is designed to help surgeons minimize the tissue removed while operating on cancer patients by providing highly accurate, real-time information about the health of the excised tissue.

They recently conducted a feasibility study with promising results that have been published in an article in Medical Image Analysis called: ""Integrated local binary pattern texture features for classification of breast tissue imaged by optical coherence microscopy.""

Huang and Zhou used multi-scale and integrated image features to improve classification accuracy and were able to achieve high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (85.2%) for cancer detection using OCM images.

""Chao has done a lot of work in new instrumentation - improving the quality of biomedical images,"" says Huang. ""Since he works on the images - or data inputs - and I work on the results of the data analysis - or outputs, our collaboration is a natural fit."""
4,4,"Duke University researchers have developed a handheld device for cervical cancer screening that promises to do away with uncomfortable speculums and high-cost colposcopes.

The ""pocket colposcope"" is a slender wand that can connect to many devices, including laptops or cell phones.

If widely adopted, women might even use the device to self-screen, transforming screening and cure rates in low-income countries and regions of the United States, where cervical cancer is most prevalent.

Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with more than 500,000 new cases occurring annually worldwide. In the United States, physicians diagnose more than 10,000 cases each year. While more than 4,000 American women die of the disease each year, the mortality rate has dropped more than 50 percent in the past four decades, largely due to the advent of well-organized screening and diagnostic programs.

While the Pap smear can be performed by a non-specialist, colposcopy requires visualization of the cervix, relying on highly trained professionals and expensive equipment that is not easily accessible to underserved populations. These factors make cervical cancer more prevalent in women living in low socioeconomic communities.

In a new paper published in the journal PLOS One, researchers from Duke believe they have found a better way.

""The mortality rate of cervical cancer should absolutely be zero percent because we have all the tools to see and treat it,"" said Nimmi Ramanujam, the Robert W. Carr, Jr., Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Duke. ""But it isn't. That is in part because women do not receive screening or do not follow up on a positive screening to have colposcopy performed at a referral clinic. We need to bring colposcopy to women so that we can reduce this complicated string of actions into a single touch point.""

Current standard practices for cervical cancer screening require three things: a speculum, a colposcope and a trained professional to administer the test.

The speculum is a metal device designed to spread the vaginal walls apart. The colposcope is a magnified telescopic device and camera designed to allow medical professionals to look through the speculum to see the cervix, which is located three to six inches inside the vagina. Colposcopes and people who know how to use them are difficult to find in many low-income regions, both domestically and internationally.

Ramanujam believes she can replace at least two of these requirements. Her laboratory has developed an all-in-one device that resembles a pocket-sized tampon with lights and a camera at one end. Health providers - or even women themselves - are able to capture images of the cervix using the rounded tip of the device to manipulate its position if necessary. The device also includes a channel through which contrast agents used for the cervical cancer screening procedure can be applied.

""We recruited 15 volunteers on Duke's campus to try out the new integrated speculum-colposcope design,"" said Mercy Asiedu, a graduate student working on the project in Ramanujam's lab. ""Nearly everyone said they preferred it to a traditional speculum and more than 80 percent of the women who tried the device were able to get a good image. Those that couldn't felt that they just needed some practice.""

Ramanujam and Asiedu are now working on clinical trials to see how their design stacks up against the traditional colposcopy used with a speculum. By using both methods to visualize the cervix, the researchers will be able to make a direct comparison.

Asiedu is also working to automate the screening process. By using image processing and machine learning to teach computers how to spot signs of precancerous and cancerous cells, Asiedu hopes to remove the need for a trained physician at any point in the screening process and shift the task to midwives, community health workers and even the women themselves.

""There have been a few other attempts to come up with a better solution, but none of them have succeeded,"" said Asiedu. ""One design using an inflatable cylinder proved just as uncomfortable as a traditional speculum. Another using directed airflow is just as bulky and expensive as a modern colposcope. With our handheld, low-cost design, we're hoping to redefine the entire procedure.""

This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (1R01CA195500, 1R01CA193380).

5,5,"During the Sunday school class in a Pentecostal church two weeks ago, Tomiwa, 11, was called upon by the coordinator of that session to read a verse in the Bible. Having been relaxed and certainly not expecting to be called, more so that there were many other Bible scholars around, she began to scramble for her eyeglasses.

Until her elder sister, who sat close to her, helped her to locate the eyeglasses, tucked somewhere in her bag, Tomiwa struggled to read the Bible passage, slowly, because she had to bring the Bible very close to her eyes, about five inches away. But when her sister located the eyeglasses and handed it over to her, she heaved a sigh of relief and began reading the passage with ease. And on a closer look, the thickness of the lenses would make it clear to anyone who bothered to look that it was beyond fashion.

In the past, like decades ago, the likes of Tomiwa had nothing to do with eyeglasses; it wasn't for children, and if they were to wear any, they were mostly for fashion.

Back then, the elderly wear glasses more. In fact, wearing a pair of glasses was like a symbol of old age.

But these days, all age groups seem to wear eyeglasses as a corrective device, regardless of gender and age. And, like Tomiwa, many children now wear eyeglasses. But why is this? Experts gave some reasons.

Birth influence: A consultant endocrinologist, Dr. Michael Olamoyegun, said apart from the fact that vision impairment could be hereditary, certain avoidable activities could be responsible for why more children now wear eyeglasses. He explained that there are certain drugs women should not take during pregnancy. If they take such drugs, he said they could cause vision impairment in the baby they are carrying. He added that in some cases, the effect of such drugs could go beyond impairment to cause outright blindness. He said, ""That is why we always counsel that pregnant women should not take drugs that have not been prescribed by doctors, because some drugs could have adverse effect on the baby. The drug may not even be harmful to the woman, but to the child.""

Untreated STD as of delivery time: It has been said that sexually transmitted diseases have enormous negative effects including infertility, kidney problem, heart-related problems, itching and irritation of the genitals, but one other thing STDs could do is that if a pregnant woman has any, it could affect the baby she is carrying. Olamoyegun said, ""When a pregnant woman has gonorrhea, we advise strongly that she gets it treated before her delivery date. This is because at the time of delivery, if the infection is still there and she's delivered of the baby through the normal birth canal, the baby, in the course of passage, could have his or her eyes affected, and that could later manifest in vision impairment. Usually, if the infection has not been completely treated as of the time of delivery, the woman could be delivered of her baby through Caeserean Section, just for the sake of the baby. So, that is another way children could contract such impairment.""

Meanwhile, findings showed that other STIs are risky to the baby, especially during childbirth because STIs are highly contagious. Genital herpes, which often manifest in sores around the vagina, is very contagious and it could affect the baby's eyes, while chlamydia, another STI, is said to have similar effect on the eyes of a baby if the mother had the infection at birth. Also, syphilis has been found to predispose children to vision impairment if their mother had it at their birth.

Perhaps this explains why parents are advised to make sure their children's eyes are examined after birth.

Use of non-prescribed drugs: According to the endocrinologist, one of the things that impair children's vision is the use of certain drugs at a tender age. He said drugs like chloroquine should not be taken by children, say below the age of 10, unless prescribed by a doctor. ""There have been instances of vision impairment in children who took chloroquine at a tender age without prescription, and there are some other drugs like that, which could affect their vision. That is why people are advised not to take drugs, unless prescribed by a doctor.""

Increased awareness: Meanwhile, an optometrist, Dr. Chigozie Onyesonwu, pointed out that increased usage of eyeglasses among children is also partly due to the fact that, with the increased awareness among parents, who now take their children for check up at an early age, some children now wear glasses in their early years to correct any defect that might arise as they grow older. He said, ""In the past, it was like a taboo to see young children wear corrective devices, and back then even if the child's complaint about his or her vision was genuine, parents would dismiss it thinking it was aimed at being fashionable, but now parents have found out that it's for the good of the child to take that step early.

Exposure to radioactive screens: Children are delighted by computers, phones and television and that is quite understandable. But findings have shown that excessive exposure to the screens of these devices could impair their vision over time. Onyesonwu said, ""The radiation, especially the blue ray, coming from the screens of those devices alters many things in the eyes of children and so parents are advised to limit their children's exposure to them. Apart from few cases that are age dependent, eye problem doesn't know gender or age, and so, parents should take note."" He stressed that adults should also limit their exposure to those screens. He added, ""For people who use computer a lot, they should try and take break off the screen intermittently, especially when they are on that marathon usage or exposure. If the light is disturbing you so much, you have to use corrective lens on the system, which would shield the eyes from the blue light. We call them anti-reflective lenses. You don't necessarily need to have eye problem before you use them, you just need to have them.""

In addition to this, WebMD, an online publisher of news and information pertaining to human health and well-being, advised people to follow the 20/20/20 rule, which says look at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds every 20 minutes. It adds that people should place their screen about 25 inches away and slightly below the eye level.

Meanwhile, regardless of whether people have impaired vision or not, Onyesonwu advised that people should visit their eye specialists from time to time, saying that is one way they could help their eyes.

On how often people should visit the specialist, he said at least once a year and that people from the age of 40 should see their eye doctor more than once a year, especially those whose families have a history of eye problem, like glaucoma. ""Most of the time, eye problem is hereditary and for people who have it in their family, once they are 40, they need to see their doctor regularly, even if it's every six months, and this is also because early detection is key in preserving the eyes,"" he added.

Interestingly, there are things people could do to have healthy eyes. According to WebMD, these include eating well, especially food that are rich in Vitamin A, as such have been found to aid good vision. Food items recommended include citrus fruits, carrot, orange, vegetables, dark leafy greens, whole grains and food rich in zinc, like beans, peanuts and poultry products, which have been found to help the eyes resist light damage. Onyesonwu said people could also consider supplements that could give the vitamins that the eyes need.

While wearing sunglasses, sometimes, has a fashion appeal, people who use them may be doing themselves some good, as they have been found to protect the eyes and help to guard against eye problems like cataracts, cornea burns and cancer of the eyelid. WebMD also advised that people whose eyes are exposed to debris or hazardous chemicals, like welders and those working in quarries or construction sites, should always use protective eyewear.

People are equally advised not to ignore eye problems, and that they should see a doctor if they notice pain, secretions, swelling, sensitivity to light or blurred vision.

Also, for people who use eyeglasses, they are advised to use only approved cleaners and they should never wear the eyeglasses to bed."
6,6,"A polyamory evangelist with a genius IQ said he got hosed out of $15,500 by a pal who goes to the Burning Man festival with him and his crew.

Leon Feingold, a Manhattan member of the brainiac club MENSA, said in 2012 he created a dues-paying group called New York Dangerous that annually sets up camp at the psychedelic drug and art festival in the Nevada desert.

But even with all of Feingold's smarts, a member of New York Dangerous managed to pull a fast one on him, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday in Manhattan Supreme Court.

Feingold says in the lawsuit that in 2016 Adam Librot hijacked New York Dangerous, creating websites for the group without permission.

When Feingold and other leadership in the group told Librot to hand over control of the domains, he initially agreed but never carried through, the lawsuit says.

Instead, Librot set up a PayPal account to collect all the membership fees for their annual trip to the desert. In total, Librot collected $20,000 in dues from about 100 members.

Feingold said Librot was one of the camp leaders for New York Dangerous, but the group makes decisions collaboratively. He said the group said no to most of Librot's planned purchases -- like a piano -- but he bought them anyway.

Out of the $20,000 in dues, Librot was only approved to spend $5,000 on Burning Man expenses, Feingold says.

""It was an awful situation. He completely went renegade and did his own thing,"" said Feingold, a lawyer and real estate broker who preaches about the pleasures of having multiple romantic partners.

After the 2016 festival, which takes place in early September, Feingold asked Librot for the remainder of the money, about $15,500. The lawsuit says Librot refused and pocketed it.

""At some point, he drained the account, put it into his own personal account and disappeared,"" Feingold told the Daily News.

Librot, a 39-year-old consultant, said Feingold's pants must be on fire because his version of events are far from the truth.

He said he spent all of the membership money on Burning Man expenses for New York Dangerous.

In fact, Librot said, he spent three weeks of his time preparing the camp for the 2016 festival and used $2,000 of his own money on expenses. He said he never asked for his cash back.

""I decided I'd rather give up a few thousand dollars than engage in the hassle of trying to get it back. But he wouldn't let me walk away,"" Librot said of Feingold.

Librot said Feingold ""enjoys the spotlight,"" noting how he posed as Christ in a recreation of the Last Supper at Burning Man in 2016.

Harvey evacuees endure housing restrictions, price gouging

Feingold only asked for the money when his fiancee was diagnosed with cancer, Librot added.

""It's a real tragic story. However, it doesn't entitle him to demand camp dues back,"" Librot said.

Feingold, who heads the Greater New York City chapter of MENSA, turned a Bushwick brownstone into a polyamorous community in 2015 for residents who are open to open relationships.

The weeklong Burning Man Festival in Black Rock, Nev., attracts 70,000 people each year, where attendees rave, build pyres and create art.

7,7,"The power holders have almost unrestricted control over people's freedoms and lives, as well as over how they perceive reality.

A view of Silivri Prison, near Istanbul,Turkey, 2014. Wikicommons/CeeGee. Some rights reserved.When the anti-terror squad raided the hotel on the island of Büyükada near Istanbul in the morning of July 5, the door of the meeting room was open. It was the fourth day of a training workshop, in which eight Turkish activists and two trainers from Germany participated. They were all arrested in the conference room of the hotel for their alleged association with an unspecified terrorist organization. The eight activists were Günal Kurşun (IHGD, Human Rights Agenda Association), İdil Eser (Amnesty International), İlknur Üstün (Women's Coalition), Nalan Erkmen (hYd, Citizens' Assembly), Nejat Taştan (Association for Monitoring Equal Rights), Özlem Dalkıran (hYd, Citizens' Assembly), Şeyhmus Özbekli (Rights Initiative) and Veli Acu (IHGD, Human Rights Agenda Association).

In addition, the two trainers Ali Ghavari and Peter Steudner were also taken into custody. The workshop was organized by IHOP (Joint Platform of Human Rights NGOs). The aim of the workshop was to increase awareness about the risks and threats that human rights defenders face, including information security and high-stress, and to develop the skills necessary to deal with them.[1]

The case reflects the sort of power relations and the particular conception of morality that dominate the so-called 'New Turkey'- that is to say Turkey as it is re-constructed under Erdogan's 'strong-willed' leadership. In this 'New Turkey' a form of violence that disregards human rights, even including the right to life and the manipulation of reality and morality to suit the interests of power holders, are part and parcel of everyday life.

Nowadays the power holders of Turkey don't need to go to great lengths to fabricate evidence or elaborate legal justifications to be able to arrest people, hold them in prolonged periods of pretrial detention, or even deprive them of their right to life. The power holders have almost unrestricted control over people's freedoms and lives, as well as over how they perceive reality - for almost all media outlets with an oppositional stance have been driven into virtual non-existence.

This mass media-driven obscurity notwithstanding, however, for those whose compass is calibrated by a quest for truth, the reality has never been this obvious. And it is because of this clarity that different actors in the mainstream, pro-government media as well as in the judicial establishment are forced to approach the matter in different ways reflecting their different styles of ingratiating themselves with the powers-that-be.

Thus for example, in the pro-government media the training workshop in question was initially presented as a meeting of international coup plotters and the fact that the arrests took place just days before the first anniversary of the failed coup attempt of July 15, 2016 allowed them to concoct a new 'glorious' history in which yet another sinister international conspiracy against the nation has been thwarted by heroic public authorities. There was, however, no shred of evidence to support such wild allegations and this absence of evidence soon became obvious even to those who have no wish to see the truth.

Hence, after a while, even some pro-government columnists and AKP politicians started to question the arrests, this time suggesting that, perhaps, it was not the arrested human rights activists who were involved in an anti-government conspiracy after all, but the officials who decided to detain them on such flimsy grounds! In the television program Media Critic broadcast on TV channel TGRT on August 18, 2017, embedded journalists Cem Kucuk and Fuat Ugur made comments to that effect. Unfortunately, in the New Turkey, even a truth that is obvious for anyone to see, does not guarantee that justice will be done. Thus, 8 of the 10 human rights activists are still in jail and all motions to release them on bail are still being denied.

This is why these arrests give us an excellent opportunity to analyze power relations in contemporary Turkey. First - a closer look at the process of the arrests themselves.

The fact that the activists were arrested in the morning was discovered only in the evening of July 5; in the meantime they were all denied access to their families and lawyers. The official report of the arrests was prepared hours after the raid and since the police could not find any evidence against them in the first seven days in which they were held in custody, the period of custody was extended to 13 days.

During that period, the police went to a fishing expedition searching their houses and going over their computers with a toothcomb in an attempt to find the slightest shred of evidence that can remotely justify their arrests. None was found, yet on the 13th day of their custody a court committed four activists and their two trainers to pretrial detention on suspicion of alleged association with unspecified terrorist organizations! The court initially released Ilknur Ustun, Nalan Erkem, Nejat Tastan and Seyhmus Ozbekli, on bail pending trial.

But the injustice of this court order was not the end of the story. It was only the beginning.

Later on, on the objection of the public prosecutor, two more activists, Ilknur Ustun and Nalan Erkem too were remanded, and thus now eight activists are in detention pending trial for an unspecified time, and the indictment against them has not yet been prepared. Ilknur Ustun is held in Sincan Prison near Ankara. The remaining seven activists were sent to Silivri prison near Istanbul, which, since its opening in 2008, has become famous for its political inmates.

All activists have been subjected to at least one day of solitary confinement. Ali Gharavi, Gunal Kursun, Peter Steudner and Veli Acu, for their part, remained for longer periods in solitary confinement, so much so that there were worries about their health. Meanwhile, Nalan Erkem has not been provided with the necessary medication for her health condition, and was brought for medical examination in handcuffs; and Idil Eser, who was under observation for a suspected cancer diagnosis, has not been examined properly. Veli Acu, who lives with a medical implant that needs to be cleaned every two days, was denied that opportunity for 20 days.

Later, it turns out that the initial arrests were based on information probably received from one of the interpreters employed for the workshop. It transpires that this person harbored nationalistic sentiments and was repeatedly pulled up by the English-speaking participants of the workshop for making false translations and asking manipulative and provocative questions. Other evidence used to justify the decision to detain the eight activists includes a childish map drawn by one of the participants in an exercise designed to reflect the most pressing issues that stress her out, and correspondence regarding the ""No"" campaign in the presidential referendum of April 16, 2017.

So there is no reasonable motive for arresting the participants. There is no evidence to justify their detention. And there is no indictment yet. But the clock of their time in jail is still ticking.

IHOP (Human Rights Joint Platform) consisting of hYd (Citizens' Assembly), IHD (Human Rights Association), IHGD (Human Rights Agenda Association) and Amnesty International, are all specialized organizations in the field of human rights advocacy, with longstanding experience in promoting democratization, equality, freedom, feminism and lgbti rights. Similarly, the participants of the workshop are all well-known and well-respected for their work in the field of human rights, and each of them represent their respective prestigious institutions.

The fact that the participants are all reputable human rights activists, well known for their contributions to the promotion of democracy and democratization both inside and outside Turkey, gave the power holders an excellent opportunity to make an international showcase of what they deem to be the new 'local and national' values of what they call the new 'New Turkey.'

It allowed them not only to stage a glorious celebration of the anniversary of the failed coup, but also to divert public attention away from the 24-day Justice March from Ankara to Istanbul organized by the main opposition party, CHP, which took between June 15 and July 9, 2017. The march was a protest against the arrest of CHP MP Enis Berberoglu. In addition to CHP supporters, many civil organizations and other opposition party members, including the Kurdish ones, participated in the march and the march ended with a big rally of more than 1 million people in Maltepe, Istanbul. Of course the accusations have no foundation in reality. But it is very important for Erdogan to keep what he calls ""local and national"" sentiments aroused, until at least the 2019 presidential elections.

At this point, not only 10 human rights activists, but also a very large number of other Turkish and International rights advocates and journalists, including such international names as Deniz Yucel, are held in jail as hostages. The most recent executive decree which allows the government to exchange international inmates in Turkish prisons for Turkish political refugees abroad, is the clearest manifestation of this approach of using judicial processes as a means to political ends.

Meanwhile Erdogan is aware of the need to keep transnational economic relations as relaxed as possible. Thus for example, the Turkish National Intelligence Agency's alleged list of German companies supporting terrorism precipitated an international crises and formal protest from Germany, upon which Turkey gave the huge bid for renewable energy to a consortium including the German giant, Siemens.

While Erdogan's responsibility in all this is undeniable, it would be a mistake to think of him as the sole perpetrator. The German media in particular signals him out as the real culprit, but this hides the fact that he has secular-nationalist partners within the state bureaucracy in devising and implementing his hardline policies. And it is impossible to understand Turkey without understanding this relationship which has its roots in an almost century-old statist tradition.

Presenting Erdogan as the only perpetrator also allows Europe in general and Germany in particular to hide the indirect support they gave to Erdogan through such political acts as Merkel's pre-election visit to Turkey on November 1, 2015 or doubling the number of arms sold to Turkey in recent years, or the shady refugee deal Merkel struck with Erdogan.

To summarize, then, while human rights activists, journalists and Kurdish politicians are held as hostages, and the tension between democracy and authoritarianism is translated into an international tension between Turkey and the European Union, the economic necessities of the neoliberal world are still met. And this allows the naked truth to be seen by those who have eyes to see.

12,12,"As we age, our tendency is to exist in comfort zones.

We're all guilty, right?

Today, I'm suggesting that you fight this natural human instinct...

Because, quite frankly, comfort zones are dangerous.Comfort zones have a deadening effect, weakening us with every breath.

So here's what I'd like you to do ASAP... Embrace chaos.

Chaos can be a very good thing.

Heck, chaos can even make you richer.

Perhaps Petyr Baelish -- a character on the popular show Game of Thrones -- put it best...

Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.

When viewed through Baelish's lens, it's easier to understand modern-day liberals -- and why they're tearing down statues. They're creating chaos -- hopeful that the chaos leads to upward mobility for millions of Americans.This happens in business, too.

Microsoft caused chaos in the 1990s, minting plenty of personal fortunes along the way.

Apple caused chaos in the 2000s and hatched a new bloodline of millionaires and billionaires as a result.

Amazon is causing chaos right now, and shareholders get richer by the day.With that in mind, below are three chaotic events happening inside the stock market at this very moment! Each ""act of chaos"" warrants your immediate investment attention.

Genetic Photoshop on the Way?

In 2003, after 13 years of painstaking work, researchers cracked the human genome code.

Consisting of more than 3.5 billion base pairs, this schematic has provided scientists with invaluable insight into how the immune system works.

In fact, immunotherapy -- a new, powerful cancer treatment that enhances a patient's own immune system to fight off cancer cells -- is a direct result of this chaotic discovery.

But it's the next application of this research that investors should really be watching for...

Using a tool called CRISPR, scientists can now actually edit genomes with precision.

The possibilities for this technology are endless...

Eradicating genetic diseases, making animal organs viable for humans or even ending famine.

To be sure, this technology is controversial and must be applied ethically.

Bottom line: Gene editing has the potential to not only save billions of lives but enrich early investors many times over as well.

Creating Billions out of Thin Air

If ever there was a chaotic invention, it's cryptocurrencies.

Ten years ago, the possibility of a digital, decentralized form of currency wasn't even on anybody's radar.

Heck, the very notion that a $175 billion market could be created out of thin air would have seemed insane.

Yet from Satoshi Nakamura's mother's basement in 2009, a giant new market has emerged.

It's no scam, either. Far from it...

In an era when governments are threatening to abolish cash and monitor everyone's payment records, an anonymous store of wealth and means of exchange, uncontrolled by governments, is clearly needed.

If Big Brother can use Big Data in an attempt to know everything, cryptocurrencies are a means by which ordinary people can fight back and preserve some financial privacy.

They are thus a vital element in our future freedoms and will continue to maintain a substantial long-term economic presence.

The prospect of portable electronic devices being able to understand, translate and then act upon commands -- spoken in every language in the world in a matter of seconds -- is as chaotic as it gets.

But thanks to profound advances in natural language processing and machine-learning, as well as wide-scale availability of mobile devices and internet access, voice is the next revolutionary -- and inevitable -- progression in the way humans interact with machines.

In fact, Gartner predicts that within 12 months, 30% of all human interactions with technology will be via voice

To quote top venture capitalist Benedict Evans, we need to prepare for a completely frictionless interface: ""No buttons, apps or intermediate steps. No 'computer stuff' between you and the service. Just use it.""

And we need to prepare now!

Although voice recognition technology has been around for decades, we're mere decimal points away from a key inflection point.

More specifically, back in the 1990s, computers could recognize roughly 60% of spoken words. Impressive, but for the technology to really be useful and gain mainstream adoption, industry insiders agreed that the accuracy rate would need to hit 95%.

Fast-forward to October 2016, and Microsoft engineers revealed in a research paper that they achieved an accuracy rate of 94.1%. Even for the most complicated languages, like Mandarin Chinese.

Then in March 2017, IBM's speech recognition team achieved a new record high at 94.5%.

""As Shawn DuBravac, chief economist for the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), says, 'We've seen more progress in this technology in the last 30 months than we saw in the last 30 years.'""

Translation: In a matter of months, we'll breach the tipping point for mass adoption.

Understandably, companies levered to this trend stand to deliver handsome profits to savvy investors.

All the major tech companies -- from Apple to Microsoft to Google to Amazon to Samsung -- are banking on voice as the next big interface.

But the most explosive profits will be confined to small-cap and microcap innovators in the space.

13,13,"Your cell phone, tablets, laptops and desktop computers could be making you ugly, according to a new research.

Have you ever noticed your skin getting darker and inflamed when you mostly stay indoors and don't even step out in the midday sun? According to a new study by skincare brand Murad, the blue light from your electronic gadgets may be causing your skin damage.

David Whyte, Murad's Asia Pacific global educator, said the excessive blue light from electronic devices -- smartphone, television and laptops, and some fluorescent lighting -- could be one of the environmental factors causing your skin damage.

Dr. Howard Murad, the brand's founder, has previously identified pollution and infrared radiation (microwave ovens), and exposure to the sun's UVA/UVB rays as among the environmental factors that contribute to skin damage. New research has emerged that excessive daily exposure to blue light also triggers inflammation and skin darkening.

In fact, excessive blue light could even be more damaging than UVA/UVB, Whyte said. Four days of eight-hour daily exposure to blue light, according to Murad, is equivalent to 20 minutes under the midday sun without sun protection.

Mineral sunscreen

Whyte, with Rustan's, recently introduced the Murad City Skin Age Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 50 PA ++++, a sunscreen that's designed even for people who stay mostly indoors.

""Just because you don't stay under the sun doesn't mean you're not being attacked by blue light or pollution, especially if you live in the urban areas,"" said the Sydney, Australia-based executive.

The City Skin Age Defense is 100-percent mineral sunscreen that contains lutein, an ingredient naturally found in dark, green leafy plants that physically blocks blue light. Murad derives its lutein from the marigold plant.

In vitro tests

In the City Skin Age Defense, Murad in vitro tests have proven that it physically blocks 89 percent of blue light from devices, and 96 percent of select pollutants.

Whyte added that you can get lutein from your food, for a more holistic, very Murad way of approaching skincare. ""There's only so much you can apply on the skin before they evaporate, so feed the body. Start from within,"" he said.

""What's exciting about the City Skin Age Defense is that I don't think there's any other brand that I'm aware of that's using lutein for blue light yet,"" Whyte said. ""It's also unique, in that it has a breathable column of polymer matrix over the surface that creates a physical barrier for pollution from getting into the skin, so it minimizes free radicals from getting in.""

Whyte had tested it in humid Manila ""and it's not greasy and doesn't sweat off, and I have very oily skin."" Since it has no hydration properties, it doesn't feel heavy even if you layer with your favorite moisturizer, he added.

Night detoxifier

There are still no studies that point to a direct link between blue light and skin cancer, he said.

To complement the sunscreen, Whyte also unveiled the City Skin Overnight Detox Moisturizer, which detoxifies the skin from the accumulated pollutants during the day while you sleep.

""When the sun goes down and you put away your laptop, it doesn't mean the damage isn't in your skin,"" Whyte said. ""The environmental aggressors that have accumulated in your skin will speed up free radicals to go on a rampage. There's a chain reaction -- they attack skin cells, so the cells power down, and then they die.""

The Overnight Detox Moisturizer is formulated with Marrubium plant skin cells, which has powerful antioxidants, and neutralizes the damage to skin cells. Romans and Arabs have used the Marrubium plant for thousands of years for various ailments.

It also has Murad's concentrated and stable form of Vitamin C, a skin brightener that also stimulates collagen and elastin production.

Whyte, however, recommends using a chemist-grade sunblock with the City Skin Age Defense on your next trip to the beach.

""This is a physical sunblock with SPF 50, but I will still not recommend it when you lie on the sand,"" he said. A chemist-grade sunscreen ""is thicker, and you won't put makeup over it. But you can layer them. It's always a good thing to layer, since people don't apply properly and patches are missed. SPFs have a time span, they rub off and degrade, so you need to reapply every two hours.""

In Australia, where people love the outdoors, Whyte said, it took decades before people made sunscreen use de rigueur -- and that was only after many studies showed the link between melanoma and excessive sun exposure.

Applying the same to the Philippines, it might ""take a couple of generations to realize its importance,"" he said. Hopefully by then, it won't be too late."

DAYS 5-6 | SEPT. 11-12

'First Reformed,' 'Downsizing' bring climate change to the fore

""Will God forgive us for destroying his creation?"" The man asking the question is the Rev. Toller (Ethan Hawke), an ex-military chaplain-turned-rural minister who finds himself undergoing a profound crisis of faith. He has already lost a son and a wife, and his insides are rotting from cancer, all of which might well drive even a devout believer to feel that God has abandoned him. But what genuinely haunts Toller, and inspires him to consider an act of extreme, violent desperation, is his eye-opening encounter with Michael (Philip Ettinger), a militant eco-activist who is terrified by the prospect of humanity's mass extinction.

""First Reformed,"" Paul Schrader's somber, beautifully composed and entirely mesmerizing new drama, is not a work of particular subtlety. Its moral argument is as clear and crystalline as its images, shot by cinematographer Alexander Dynan in the nearly square academy-aspect ratio. The severity of Toller's convictions, as well as his disgust at the knowledge that his church has taken money from one of the town's biggest polluters, gives rise to an angry, confrontational question: Why have so many Christians rejected the science of climate change, effectively abdicated their God-given responsibility to look after the Earth?

Speaking as a believer who has often pondered that and other dispiriting questions about why evangelical Christianity has been so readily co-opted by conservative politics, I'll confess that the heaviness of Schrader's moral inquiry and the earnestness of his provocations were right up my alley. And it's nothing short of fascinating to watch the director reconcile the queasy momentum of a thriller with the hushed, transcendental austerity of the masters he's emulating: Even if Schrader hadn't acknowledged his debt to ""Diary of a Country Priest,"" the visual and dramatic parallels between his film and that 1951 Robert Bresson masterpiece would be more than apparent. (Ingmar Bergman's ""Winter Light"" looms heavily over the proceedings too.)

""First Reformed,"" which played at the Venice and Telluride film festivals before arriving in Toronto, is an exceptional return to form for Schrader after several much-maligned disappointments (""The Canyons,"" ""Dying of the Light""). It continues the director's career-long grappling with his Calvinist beliefs, even as it becomes the latest iteration of a story he has told before, in movies like ""American Gigolo"" and ""Hardcore"" and his screenplay for ""Taxi Driver."" (Amanda Seyfried is piercingly good as the environmentalist's pregnant wife, whose relationship with Toller sets the drama fatefully in motion.)

Above all, perhaps, it is a timely reminder that Ethan Hawke is one of the most reliable and severely underrated actors working today; he holds nearly every frame of this picture with the initially calm, easygoing demeanor of a friendly neighborhood pastor, only to give way to greater and greater fits of rage and torment. At the film's Venice press conference, Hawke noted that he had been ""surrounded by religion"" his entire life, and that his great-grandmother once wanted him to enter the priesthood. He may not have been destined to be a man of the cloth, but ""First Reformed"" leaves no doubt he was born to play one.

The issue of climate change also figures prominently in Alexander Payne's wry science-fiction comedy ""Downsizing,"" though only at the end of a long and convoluted story that seems to be making itself up as it goes along. For a while, that's not such a bad thing. The movie has an enjoyable opening hour in which it lays out the basics of its rigorous, ludicrous premise: In a not-so-distant future, an unprepossessing nice guy named Paul Safranek (Matt Damon) opts to shrink himself to just a few inches tall, availing himself of a dynamic new procedure devised by Norwegian scientists that promises stability and even prosperity in an unforgiving economy.

If Paul is shrinking himself, it's nice for a while to see Payne stretching himself. He's still working in the barbed humanist vein of films like ""Sideways,"" ""The Descendants"" and ""Nebraska,"" but this time with an out-there twist that raises far broader implications beyond Paul's quality of life. ""Downsizing"" begins as a high-concept farce, morphs into a satire of class, consumerism and globalization, and ends with a sincere lament for Third World suffering and the sustainability of the planet.

But the reach of the movie's topical ambitions far exceeds its tonal grasp. More often than not, Payne's preferred method of trying to squeeze laughs and tears from the same moment -- or rather, following a lump-in-the-throat moment with a carefully timed comic jab -- simply cancels itself out. There's an emotional flatness to this movie, which doesn't feel like it's bursting with ideas so much as meandering noncommittally from one to the next.

Damon comes off as a total shlump, but that's what his Everyman role more or less calls for. Elsewhere, there's fine supporting work from Kristen Wiig as Paul's wife and from the eccentric duo of Christoph Waltz and Udo Kier as a couple of pint-sized opportunists who give the proceedings a regular jolt of comic energy. Enlisted for a similar purpose, but also an ostensibly grander one, is Hong Chau, who turns up in the role of Ngoc, a disabled Vietnamese refugee who was forced to undergo the shrinking procedure against her will. Despite her sufferings, which (ahem) dwarf Paul's significantly, she retains an energetic can-do spirit and an unflagging empathy for the most marginalized people in this diminutive society.

""What an inspiration,"" you're meant to think. ""What a crock,"" I concluded. There's an art to depicting a character who speaks in broken pidgin English without lapsing into caricature, but Payne, whose writing is rarely more condescending than when it's straining for sensitivity, may not be the artist to pull it off. Chau is an excellent actress (as borne out even by her minor role in ""Big Little Lies,"" which I had the pleasure of bingeing right before Toronto), but Ngoc is an appalling creation. Ridiculed and sanctified in equal measure, she's the kind of sop to on-screen diversity that makes you wish the filmmakers had left white enough alone.

DAY 4 | SEPT. 10

The dead-dad dramas of 'Disobedience' and 'Dark River'

Covering the Toronto International Film Festival can sometimes make you feel like one of those fabled blind men touching the elephant.

Trying to find a unifying festival theme, a favorite sport of journalists but a dubious endeavor under most circumstances, becomes outright impossible at a festival as immense as this one. (The 2017 edition, although slimmed down from last year's program by a reported 20%, boasts no fewer than 255 features.) Every attendee is on his or her own unique track, and while we can certainly identify dramatic and thematic parallels within those tracks, ascribing some sort of grand narrative to the festival as a whole is generally a fool's errand.

So, I won't make too much of the fact that a few of the movies I've seen in the last several days seem to be carrying on a conversation about the plight of young people chafing against the social and cultural restrictions imposed by their families. Going deeper still, the movies I'm thinking of all address the specific plight of women and their difficult relationships with their fathers, whose sins run the gamut from being unreasonably demanding to inflicting acts of physical and psychological abuse.

One of the most fascinating aspects of Aaron Sorkin's biographical drama ""Molly's Game,"" which I wrote about in my previous entry, is the notion that Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain), a Colorado-born cocktail waitress who found herself running a high-stakes New York gambling operation, has conceived her entire scheme as an act of revenge against her intensely tough and critical father (Kevin Costner). It's likely to be the most criticized element of the story, insofar as it uses deep-seated daddy issues to lightly chip away at our heroine's psychological armor, but it's also a possibility that the movie playfully considers, and critiques, in ways both humorous and cathartic.

By contrast, we never see father and daughter together in Sebastián Lelio's somber and passionate new drama, ""Disobedience,"" which begins with the death of a celebrated Orthodox rabbi in North London -- a loss that brings his only child, Ronit (Rachel Weisz), back home from New York to settle her father's estate. Received with frosty politeness by the community she fled years ago for a life of secular freedom, Ronit gradually rekindles her friendship with Esti (Rachel McAdams), whom she is surprised to learn is now the wife of Dovid (Alessandro Nivola), a spiritual disciple of Ronit's father.

As will soon come to light, in a series of erotic encounters that are at once tasteful and unusually candid for a prestige drama, Ronit and Esti carry a torch for one another that years apart has failed to extinguish. That more or less explains why Ronit left, but the film, adapted from Naomi Alderman's 2006 novel, is equally curious about why Esti stayed. Both Rachels are superb here, and if Weisz is ultimately the story's anchor, the grieving outsider whose perspective we share at every moment, then McAdams is its secret weapon: She's piercing to watch as she reveals the cracks in her character's quietly contented facade, in a story that takes the full measure of her tragedy as well.

The intensity of repressed feeling coursing beneath so much grave religiosity has already led some to liken the film to an Orthodox Jewish retelling of ""Carol."" It's not at all an unflattering comparison; I'd add only that ""Disobedience,"" with its gray, muted palette, also reminded me at times of ""Beyond the Hills,"" the grim 2012 Romanian drama about inconvenient lesbian desires threatening the sanctity and order of an Orthodox convent.

But Lelio, a gifted Chilean writer-director (""Gloria"") making his first English-language feature, remains exquisitely attentive, even generous, to the people and circumstances surrounding Ronit and Esti. He understands that desire and identity don't take shape in a vacuum, and that while religion can be an instrument of oppression, it can also be a source of deep, abiding mystery.

I headed straight from ""Disobedience"" on Sunday night to the premiere of Clio Barnard's superbly atmospheric ""Dark River,"" another movie that begins with a daughter's homecoming after her father's death. This one, however, is set not in London but rather in the farther-flung sheep pastures of Yorkshire, where a woman named Alice (Ruth Wilson) has spent 15 years drifting and working as a shearer. Once she learns of her dad's passing, she immediately returns home to claim tenancy of her family's small farm, to which she believes she is entitled, although her rough, ill-tempered brother, Joe (Mark Stanley), obviously has different ideas in mind.

Adapted and significantly changed from Rose Tremain's France-set novel ""Trespass,"" ""Dark River"" is both a ferocious drama of sibling animus -- beautifully enacted by Wilson and Stanley -- and a harrowing chronicle of abuse. We glimpse Alice's physical violation at her father's hands in brief, splintered flashbacks, which Barnard weaves into her narrative with shivery skill. Audiences who have seen the director's brilliant experimental documentary ""The Arbor"" (2011) and her heartrending drama ""The Selfish Giant"" (2013), know her skill at conjuring a bleakly enveloping sense of place, and this movie, with its wild, rugged moors pelted by sudden rains, is no exception.

""Dark River"" is screening in Toronto's Platform competition, as is ""What Will People Say,"" a strong second feature directed by Iram Haq, whose 2013 debut, ""I Am Yours,"" was informed by her own experiences growing up in Norway as the daughter of Pakistani immigrants. Her follow-up, by the director's own admission, is even more hair-raisingly personal. It tells the story of 16-year-old Nisha (Maria Mozhdah), who, after being caught with a boy in her bedroom by her father (Adil Hussain), is effectively kidnapped by her own family and sent to live with relatives in Pakistan, a world that could scarcely be more different from the snowy Norwegian town she once called home.

My thoughts kept returning to ""What Will People Say"" while I was watching ""Disobedience,"" insofar as both films are about insular communities that can become religious and cultural prisons, especially for young daughters who fail to live up to their parents' exacting (double) standards of sexual purity. In Haq's film, we repeatedly hear Nisha's parents complaining about how her actions have exposed them to deep social shame, though it's a measure of where this film's sympathies ultimately lie that we hear more about that shame than we actually see it.

DAY 3 | SEPT. 9

'The Shape of Water' triumphs in Venice, while 'Molly's Game' comes up aces in Toronto

The announcement Saturday that Guillermo del Toro's ""The Shape of Water"" had won the Golden Lion, the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, came as both heartening news and a reminder that, while one major film gathering is crazy enough, two unfolding simultaneously can be a recipe for pure madness.

I was at TIFF in 2009 when word reached us that Samuel Maoz's ""Lebanon,"" a drama notable for unfolding entirely within the tight confines of an Israeli tank, had just won the Golden Lion in Venice. Within minutes, a small, high-concept war movie from a little-known filmmaker became Toronto's hottest ticket, causing a near-stampede among journalists racing to get to the next screening.

Maoz came close to repeating that victory Saturday: His long-overdue follow-up feature, ""Foxtrot,"" won Venice's second-place grand jury prize. Whether or not that honor raises the film's profile here in Toronto, it deserves to. A wrenchingly acted, ingeniously structured drama about Israeli parents (Lior Ashkenazi and Sarah Adler) grieving the loss of their soldier son, ""Foxtrot"" is both a logical companion piece to ""Lebanon"" and a marked improvement on it. This time, the formal conceits enhance and deepen the tragedy rather than stifling it.

But the big winner of the day, and the first American film to take the Golden Lion since Sofia Coppola's ""Somewhere"" in 2010, was ""The Shape of Water,"" a densely imagined period fantasy that marks an exquisite return to form for Del Toro. Already warmly embraced by festival audiences in Telluride, Colo., and set to premiere in Toronto on Monday evening, the movie tells of a most remarkable discovery -- an amphibious humanoid creature, found somewhere off South America -- that is being kept locked in a tank at a U.S. government facility amid the mounting Cold War anxieties of 1962.

If that seems plenty outlandish already, rest assured that Del Toro is just getting started. Always a spirited devotee of old-school Hollywood genres, the director achieves an inspired melding of creature feature, spy thriller and wondrously perverse love story, the latter sustained by Sally Hawkins' achingly delicate performance as Eliza, a mute cleaning lady who immediately bonds with the imprisoned merman (played, naturally, by Del Toro's prosthetic-happy muse, Doug Jones).

But then, there's great acting everywhere you look in ""The Shape of Water,"" from Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins as Eliza's loyal friends, Michael Stuhlbarg as a doctor who becomes an unexpected ally, and Michael Shannon, almost too ideally cast as a scarily menacing federal agent.

Like Del Toro's 2006 triumph, ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" ""The Shape of Water"" is a once-upon-a-time fairy tale rooted in a specific historical moment. It's rich and transporting, if also a bit calculated in its lyricism; you can sometimes see Del Toro's mental gears spinning as he writes his characters into one corner after another. But there's no denying they spin with passion.

Elsewhere, I hope Toronto festival-goers (to say nothing of the broader art-house audience) will have the chance to see some of the other Venice prizewinners playing here. I was glad I made time for ""Custody,"" a razor-sharp, genuinely harrowing story of a very bad dad (the terrifying Denis Ménochet) terrorizing his young son and his soon-to-be-former wife. It's an impressive feature debut for French filmmaker Xavier Legrand (an Oscar nominee in the short film category), who duly won the Venice jury's Silver Lion for best director, and who stands a shot at winning another prize in Toronto's Platform competition.

Also screening in that program is Warwick Thornton's ""Sweet Country,"" a deliberately paced, morally bruising tale of frontier violence set in 1929 Alice Springs, in Australia's Northern Territory. Like his 2009 debut, ""Samson & Delilah,"" the new film, which won a special jury prize in Venice, finds Thornton expressing a palpable anger at the brutal mistreatment of his country's Aboriginal people, in a style that melds classical western filmmaking with studied art-film longueurs.

Few people are having a busier festival season than Annette Bening, who not only served as president of this year's Venice jury but also has a new movie, ""Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool,"" which is screening here in Toronto following its Telluride premiere. Directed by Paul McGuigan (in a decisive change of pace after ""Victor Frankenstein""), the film offers a ""My Week With Marilyn""-style gloss on the life of the great, oft-neglected stage and screen actress Gloria Grahame (Bening), who won an Academy Award for ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" and who is perhaps best remembered now for her heartbreaking performance opposite Humphrey Bogart in Nicholas Ray's 1950 noir masterpiece, ""In a Lonely Place.""

""Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool"" regards Grahame through the eyes of a young Brit named Peter Turner (Jamie Bell), who was an up-and-coming actor in his 20s when he began a love affair with Grahame, a woman almost 30 years his senior. At the time, Grahame was trying to re-energize her acting career on the London stage, and the movie glides between sunny California and not-so-sunny England, between Grahame's tempestuous romance with Turner and her later years wasting away from cancer in Liverpool, under the care of Turner and his family. The movie is wanly conventional but affecting, and Bell holds his own very nicely opposite Bening, who marbles her gift for emotional nuance with a palpable respect for her character's often shabbily treated Hollywood legacy.

Whether the feat of playing an Oscar winner will finally net that elusive lead actress statuette for Bening herself is one of the questions looming over this year's awards-season landscape -- one that might have been settled, perhaps, if the actress had received the honors she deserved for last year's ""20th Century Women."" As it is, the latest Toronto chatter suggests she may face another stiff round of competition this time from a field that includes Hawkins in ""The Shape of Water""; Margot Robbie in the Tonya Harding biopic ""I, Tonya""; Frances McDormand, so commanding in Martin McDonagh's small-town noir ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri""; and Jennifer Lawrence, the beating heart of Darren Aronofsky's thrilling and divisive ""mother!""

I'll have more to say about ""mother!"" in my review for The Times when the film opens in theaters. But I'll reserve a few words here in praise of Jessica Chastain, who is rightly drawing raves for her forceful, breathtakingly controlled work in ""Molly's Game."" Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut tells the fiendishly complicated story of how a very smart 26-year-old named Molly Bloom (Chastain) came to operate a high-stakes gambling ring that pulled in Hollywood celebrities, Wall Street billionaires and Russian mobsters -- a recipe not only for a very expensive disaster but also for a sensationally entertaining movie that maintains a tight grip on the audience over nearly 2½ hours.

Not least among its accomplishments, ""Molly's Game"" drives a nail into the coffin of the idea that voice-over is an anti-cinematic device. Sorkin remains a master of breathless, hyper-articulate verbiage; you could cut yourself with some of the dialogue volleys that Molly and her attorney (an excellent Idris Elba) fling back and forth. But in contrast with his fact-based scripts for ""The Social Network"" and ""Steve Jobs,"" he relies heavily this time on his protagonist to tell her own story, and she does so, with nearly wall-to-wall narration that doesn't waste a single word.

It's a pointed decision from a writer who has often been taken to task for his representations of women, and who has clearly decided to greet that charge head-on. The gamble paid off. By the end of ""Molly's Game,"" Chastain isn't the only one looking like a winner.

DAY 2 | SEPT. 8

The brilliance of Saoirse Ronan and the thrilling challenge of 'Zama'

What comes to mind when you hear the name Greta Gerwig? Maybe it's the cancer-stricken punk-feminist photographer she brought to such vivid life in last year's ""20th Century Woman,"" or the delightfully loopy screwball princesses she played in ""Mistress America"" and ""Damsels in Distress."" For me, it's the blissful image of Gerwig running in ""Frances Ha,"" her arms flailing and her hair whipping behind her as she sprints and leaps down a New York Chinatown street -- an ebullient vision of carefree innocence set to the crackling beat of David Bowie's ""Modern Love.""

FULL COVERAGE: Toronto International Film Festival 2017 ""

I thought about that image a few times during ""Lady Bird,"" a delightfully spry and smart high school comedy that marks Gerwig's solo directing debut. (She co-directed the 2008 indie ""Nights and Weekends"" with Joe Swanberg.) Set during the early 2000s, a time of clunky desktop computers and news of the Iraq war blaring from every TV screen, the movie follows a fiercely independent Sacramento teenager named Christine (Saoirse Ronan) -- or Lady Bird, as she has defiantly rechristened herself -- as she tries to deal with an overly critical mother (Laurie Metcalf), changing friendships, all manner of boy trouble and the usual anxieties about college and the future.

In other words, ""Lady Bird"" isn't out to reinvent the coming-of-age genre, though what it lacks in originality it makes up for in sheer velocity. The movie runs 94 minutes and moves like the wind. Gerwig paces every comic episode so briskly, and with such a joyous sense of forward propulsion, that we feel effortlessly caught up in what we're watching: not a series of carefully plotted mishaps and epiphanies, but rather the swiftly pulsing beats of time -- and life itself -- passing our heroine by.

Not every actor-turned-director with a distinctive on-screen presence necessarily brings that presence to bear on their filmmaking; I'd go so far as to say most of them don't. This year's Toronto program offers a number of opportunities to test that theory, including Angelina Jolie's ""First They Killed My Father,"" a well-received drama set during the 1970s Cambodian genocide, and George Clooney's ""Suburbicon,"" a misfired attempt to reinvigorate the dark-underbelly-of-the-American-dream subgenre through a racially segregated 1950s prism.

Gerwig has noted the semi-autobiographical nature of her story, but a basis in real life alone wouldn't be enough to make it ring true. The casting is impeccable down to the smallest role; there are terrific performances by Beanie Feldstein as Lady Bird's loyal best friend, Lucas Hedges as her theater-geek crush, Tracy Letts as her easygoing dad and, best of all, Metcalf as a mother who shows how resentment can be an act of love (and also how it can't).

And then there is Ronan, who, whether or not she resembles the 2002-era Greta Gerwig, owns her role with a flinty intelligence and piercing vulnerability that makes you want to follow her anywhere she goes -- by which I don't mean just Christine/Lady Bird, but also Ronan herself. This remarkable actress has gone from strength to strength in recent years, peaking with her astonishingly fine-grained work in ""Brooklyn,"" in which she played a very different young woman tentatively finding her way in the world.

Ronan is so good that she can emerge smelling like a rose even from a well-mounted if ultimately unsatisfying effort like ""On Chesil Beach,"" her other picture playing in Toronto this year. Seeing that movie back-to-back with ""Lady Bird,"" if anything, only underscored the actress' versatility: Whereas Gerwig's film casts her as a 21st century American teenager eager to fall in love and shed her virginity, ""On Chesil Beach"" locks her into the role of Florence, a British woman who embodies the buttoned-down timidity of the stifling, pre-sexual-revolution 1960s.

Adapted by Ian McEwan from his own novel, the movie centers on Florence and her genial, slightly awkward new husband, Edward (Billy Howle, likable but not quite up to the level of his more established co-star), as they make an ill-fated attempt to consummate their marriage. A painfully awkward beachside retreat is interspersed with telling flashbacks to their respective histories, resulting in a lumpy, lurching back-and-forth structure that suggests a movie forever clearing its throat to articulate something meaningful.

Individual scenes play deftly enough; the director, Dominic Cooke, is a theater veteran making his feature debut, and he coaxes as much emotional truth out of this clenched, overdetermined scenario as possible (as well as a certain degree of cringe-inducing comedy). And Ronan, who came to prominence in a considerably better McEwan adaptation called ""Atonement,"" gives eloquent voice and conviction to Florence's repression. Her tempestuous emotions complicate a story that often feels too tidy by half.

""Too tidy by half"" are not words that any critic will level against the South American period epic ""Zama,"" which surely ranks among the most challenging, intricately structured and formally innovative pictures playing in Toronto. Like the previous features directed by the brilliant Argentinean filmmaker Lucrecia Martel (""La Ciénaga,"" ""The Holy Girl,"" ""The Headless Woman""), this isn't just a movie but a full-on miasma -- a humid, atmospheric vision of a complex world conjured from the inside.

Every new scene presents itself as a kind of puzzle in which viewers must continually reorient themselves. Do not look to any of the characters to walk you through who they are, what happened before or what will happen next. ""Zama"" doesn't filter history through an easily clarifying prism. Through her sly editorial disjunctions, her tactile, off-center compositions and her wild, teeming sonic landscape, Martel conjures the haunted interiority of the past. She brings history into an uncomfortably intimate present tense.

The film is an adaptation of Antonio di Benedetto's 1956 novel about Diego de Zama (Daniel Giménez Cacho, never cracking a smile), an official of the Spanish crown who has been stationed for years at a remote outpost in what is now Paraguay, where he is impatiently awaiting a transfer. But it's immediately clear from the outset that Zama's wait will be in vain, and that as he wearily seeks a series of favors -- from a local minister or a teasing noblewoman (Lola Dueñas, a regular of Pedro Almodóvar, one of the film's co-producers) -- we will observe the stagnation and rot of the colonialist experiment firsthand.

In ""The Headless Woman,"" her 2008 puzzler about a woman who may or may not have run over a child with her car, Martel gave us a dark comedy of bourgeois indictment, evoking the woman's concussed, amnesiac state without assuaging, let alone absolving, her guilt. Emerging nearly 10 years later and set more than two centuries earlier, ""Zama"" nonetheless suggests a curious extension of that film's waking nightmare, in which the scars of oppression are no less evident. Watch how carefully Martel etches the brutal reality of slavery in her images, the way she uses crowded frames and half-naked bodies to suggest humanity matter-of-factly choking the life out of its own. Even before the movie erupts in a fatal, inevitable crescendo of violence, you can feel dread emanating from every pore.

""Zama"" isn't easy. I saw it for the first time last week at the Venice Film Festival, where I was in attendance as a guest of the Biennale College program, and I don't mind admitting that my intense jet lag, confronted with Martel's attention-demanding style, kept me from getting more than a foothold. A wide-awake second viewing in Toronto with a packed press audience -- most of whom, despite a few walkouts, clung to every perplexing, thrilling moment -- felt revelatory, even restorative. This is a long-overdue return from a master filmmaker whose next cinematic enigma is hopefully not another decade off. ""Zama"" may be a challenge, but at this point in the festival, it also feels like a gift.

DAY 1 | SEPT. 7

Wiseman's 'Ex Libris' enthralls, while 'Borg/McEnroe' serves its purpose

For better and for worse, the Toronto International Film Festival is an event that invites bold predictions, most of them involving the months-long industry and media grind that we call awards season. Four years ago, Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave"" so galvanized audiences here that a number of journalists declared the race for the best picture Oscar effectively over. (They were right.) It's still too early in this year's 42nd annual festival for anyone to have made a similar declaration yet, although a few tantalizing narratives have already begun to surface.

One of these is the widespread adoration of ""Call Me by Your Name,"" Luca Guadagnino's intoxicating coming-of-age love story, which has enraptured festival audiences (myself included) since its first screenings at Sundance. Its spell showed no signs of abating in Toronto, where it screened for a public audience on Thursday night, with Guadagnino in attendance with his stars Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer.

And speaking of actors, in the next few days festival-goers will spend minutes in line parsing the Oscar prospects of overdue stars like Gary Oldman and Annette Bening, whose respective films, ""Darkest Hour"" and ""Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool,"" are set to screen here after making their festival debuts in Telluride, Colo., last week.

Oscar buzz has become a necessary evil at Toronto. On one hand it ensures the packed houses, bustling red carpets and gobs of press coverage that keep this festival running year after year. But it also inevitably overshadows the many, many worthy films that arrive here with no media profile or awards prospects of which to speak, and which have little hope of finding a commercial audience anywhere near as sizable or enthusiastic as the up-for-anything crowds packing Toronto screening venues this week.

Few people are having a busier festival season than Annette Bening, who not only served as president of this year's Venice jury but also has a new movie, ""Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool,"" which is screening here in Toronto following its Telluride premiere. Directed by Paul McGuigan (in a decisive change of pace after ""Victor Frankenstein""), the film offers a ""My Week With Marilyn""-style gloss on the great stage and screen actress Gloria Grahame (Bening), who won an Academy Award for ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" and is perhaps best remembered today for her heartbreaking performance opposite Humphrey Bogart in Nicholas Ray's magnificent 1950 noir, ""In a Lonely Place.""

""Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool"" regards Grahame through the eyes of a young Brit named Peter Turner (Jamie Bell), who was an up-and-coming actor in his 20s when he began a love affair with Grahame, a woman almost 30 years his senior. At the time, Grahame had been largely forgotten by Hollywood and had shifted her attention to the London stage, and the movie glides between sunny California and not-so-sunny England, between Grahame's tempestuous romance with Turner and her later years wasting away from cancer in Liverpool, under the care of Turner and his family. The movie is wanly conventional but affecting, and Bell holds his own very nicely opposite Bening, who marbles her gift for emotional nuance with a palpable respect for her character's often shabbily treated Hollywood legacy.

Whether the feat of playing an Oscar winner will finally net that elusive lead actress statuette for Bening herself is one of the questions looming over this year's awards-season landscape -- one that might have been settled, perhaps, if the actress had received the nomination she deserved for her achingly good performance in last year's ""20th Century Women."" As it is, the latest Toronto chatter suggests she may face another stiff round of competition this year from a field that includes Sally Hawkins in ""The Shape of Water""; Margot Robbie in the Tonya Harding biopic ""I, Tonya""; Frances McDormand, so commanding in Martin McDonagh's small-town noir ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri""; and Jennifer Lawrence, the beating heart of Darren Aronofsky's thrilling and divisive ""mother!""

I'll have more to say about ""mother!"" in my review for The Times when the film opens in theaters next week. But I'll reserve a few words here in praise of Jessica Chastain, who is drawing well-deserved raves for her performance in ""Molly's Game."" Aaron Sorkin's terrifically suave directorial debut tells the fiendishly complicated story of how a very smart 26-year-old named Molly Bloom (Chastain) came to operate a high-stakes gambling ring that pulled in Hollywood celebrities, Wall Street billionaires and Russian mobsters -- a recipe for very expensive disaster, but also, in this case, for a sensationally entertaining movie that never loosens its grip over the course of nearly two-and-a-half hours.

Not least among its accomplishments, ""Molly's Game"" drives a nail into the coffin of the idea that voiceover is somehow an anti-cinematic device. Sorkin remains a master of breathless, hyper-articulate verbiage; you could cut yourself with some of the dialogue volleys that Molly and her attorney (an excellent Idris Elba) fling back and forth. But in contrast with Sorkin's fact-based scripts for ""The Social Network"" and ""Steve Jobs,"" this time he relies heavily on his protagonist to tell her own story, and she does so, with nearly wall-to-wall narration, that doesn't waste a single word. It's a pointed decision from a writer who has often been taken to task for his female characters, and who has clearly decided to greet that charge head-on. The gamble paid off; by the end of ""Molly's Game,"" Bloom isn't the only one who looks like a real winner.

To partially redress that sad state of affairs, allow me to make my own prediction -- an impish and utterly unprovable one, measurable only by the whimsies of personal taste, but one that I believe has a decent chance of holding true when the festival is over. Namely, there will be no better new movie at TIFF this year than ""Ex Libris -- The New York Public Library,"" Frederick Wiseman's almost indecently rich and stimulating new documentary, which represents a landmark achievement even in the context of this master filmmaker's career.

First presented last week in competition at the Venice Film Festival, ""Ex Libris"" screened Thursday for press and industry audiences in Toronto, or at least the handful who were willing to set aside three hours and 17 minutes for an impassioned deep-dive portrait of an invaluable institution. Limiting himself to 11 of the New York Public Library's 92 branches, and returning continually to its fabled flagship building on Fifth Avenue opposite East 41st Street, Wiseman sifts through lectures, classes, Q&As, policy meetings, tutoring sessions and stage performances to build a mighty case for the library as the city's social and intellectual lifeblood.

From an onstage conversation with Elvis Costello to a community discussion of the misrepresentation of slavery in McGraw-Hill textbooks to a Gabriel Garciá Márquez book group so smart and impassioned that I wanted to sign up for it immediately, ""Ex Libris"" demonstrates Wiseman's usual genius at constructing a mosaic of the quotidian. As always, we are never with any one story for very long, although there are a few threads to which the film keeps returning, none more significant than a staff meeting to determine how best to digitize the library's materials and boost online use in a city where many New Yorkers still don't have access to the Internet.

""Libraries are not about books,"" one observer notes. ""Libraries are about people."" And because Wiseman's cinema has always concerned itself with people -- people at work, people in conversation, people helping others, people trying to better themselves -- it would be hard to imagine a more fitting alchemy of filmmaker and subject. His films have always been, to some degree, about the pursuit of knowledge, a fact that gives ""Ex Libris"" the feel of an epic career summation.

It would also be hard to imagine a subtler or more devastating rebuke of the anti-intellectualism embodied by the Trump administration, which has spent much of the past year threatening the funding of arts and cultural institutions nationwide, libraries included. ""Ex Libris,"" which opens in theaters later this month through Zipporah Films, offers a troubling reminder of what we stand to lose if greedy, short-sighted policies are allowed to prevail. But the movie is the opposite of pessimistic: It suggests that the desire for knowledge, creativity and community is its own sustaining, revitalizing impulse.

The festivities got off to a slick, serviceable start on Thursday night with the official opening-night selection, ""Borg/McEnroe,"" a slick, lightweight dramatization of the nail-biting 1980 Wimbledon showdown between those powerhouse players, Björn Borg and John McEnroe. Directed by the Danish-born Janus Metz, it's one of a few films this year that suggest TIFF might as well temporarily change its name to the Tennis International Film Festival; the others include ""Battle of the Sexes,"" starring Emma Stone and Steve Carell as Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, respectively, and ""Love Means Zero,"" Jason Kohn's documentary about the legacy of star tennis coach Nick Bollettieri.

At times suggesting a less adrenalized version of Ron Howard's Formula One rivalry saga, ""Rush"" (2013), ""Borg/McEnroe"" is an involving if low-impact study in emotional contrasts. Cross-cutting between his protagonists in precise, well-targeted editorial volleys, with occasional flashbacks to their respective troubled childhoods, Metz shows how the cool, calculating Swedish stud and the foul-mouthed American hothead may have had more inner demons in common than you might expect.

That tidy psychological construct is reinforced by fine performances from the Swedish-born Icelandic actor Sverrir Gudnason, whose brooding affect captures the machine-like precision and emotional containment that defined Borg's behavior on (and mostly off) the court, and from Stellan Skarsgard as Borg's long-suffering coach, Lennart Bergelin. And Shia LaBeouf, always an erratic talent, acquits himself nicely, or not so nicely, as McEnroe; there's something fitting about enlisting one notoriously filter-free bad boy to play another.

There have been far better and far worse TIFF opening-night movies than ""Borg/McEnroe,"" which is fast-paced, inoffensive and about as emotionally resonant as your next poutine. But few have been more emblematic of the reality that film festivals have become their own competitive sport -- a kind of cinephile Grand Slam.

The year begins with Sundance and Berlin, both held shortly after the Australian Open in January, then builds to the Gallic prestige of Cannes in May, right before the French Open. There may be no Wimbledon equivalent on the festival calendar, but the U.S. Open works overtime to make up the difference, falling at roughly the same time as Venice, Telluride and Toronto.

And of course, that fall trifecta constitutes a competition unto itself, one that threatened to turn nasty three years ago when Toronto, irked by Telluride's early access to some of the season's most coveted films, sought to impose a penalty of sorts by restricting all Telluride-screened titles from screening the first weekend of TIFF.

Since then those rules have relaxed and the tensions have largely blown over. Venice, Telluride and Toronto have mostly learned to share and play nice, as they have done for the four-plus decades that all three have been in existence.

The system, as it is, still sends an enormous glut of films scrambling for a limited number of slots, hopefully bolstering their Oscar hopes and burnishing the festivals' reputations in the process. And as the films roll out (or worse, even before they roll out), we find ourselves treating their fortunes as sport, pitting them against each other, judging their long-term prospects with critics and academy voters, and effectively dividing them into winners or losers.

Cannes or Venice? Telluride or Toronto? ""Moonlight"" or ""La La Land""? In a system so driven by narratives of competition, it can be awfully hard to appreciate the actual art that ostensibly motivates all this premature handicapping. It's a problem from which I certainly don't exempt myself; on the contrary, I'm as invested as anyone in seeing my own personal favorites duly and tangibly rewarded.

Which brings me to a concluding thought and my own shameless awards-season plug: Frederick Wiseman received an honorary award earlier this year from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, an organization that has never seen fit to nominate one of his films for an Oscar for documentary feature. Wouldn't the release of ""Ex Libris"" suggest the perfect opportunity to rectify that particular injustice?

16,16,"Drug designing tools are software and databases that are used at an early stage of modern drug discovery process. The use of computers and computational tools have permeated all aspects of drug-discovery and have formed essential part of structure-based drug design. Drug discovery and development is tremendous lengthy process involving multiple disciplines such as chemistry, biology, biophysics, structural biology and computational science. Typical drug discovery starts with target identification, lead discovery & optimization, pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies involving approximately 12 to 14 years and costs up to US$ 1.2 to 1.4 Bn. However, in silico screening of chemical database has now become the important tool to reduce the time, cost and chances of failure of lead at later stage of development. Computer aided drug designing or in silico drug designing has gained significant momentum in past 3 decades. There are different techniques used in in silico drug designing and including visualization, molecular dynamics simulation, homology, energy minimization tools, molecular docking etc. drug discovery tools can be used in all stages of drug development including discovery pre-clinical and clinical stage. Today all pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies take the advent of drug designing tools to cut down the time and resources required in drug development process and modern drug discovery is almost impossible without the use of computational tools. Thus market for drug designing tools is ever growing with rapid technological advancements developments.

Drug Designing Tools Market: Drivers and Restraints

Ball believes AI and machine learning will give people more flexibility, and a better work-life balance.

""AI will allow us to be more human and allow us to spend more time thinking about the big problems in the world, and what matters,"" she says.

AI has existed over the past 40 to 50 years as a principle discipline. It started in 1956 at Dartmouth University in the UK. Since then this technology has been on the rise and is having a significant impact of many industries.

""The basic thesis back then was computers are complicated, humans are complicated, so why can't we get computers to behave like humans.""

Ball says computers - and robots - are only as good as people make them, and there's plenty of room for development.

Rod Drury, founder and chief executive of accounting software maker Xero, says his firm has taken its first steps towards the use of artificial intelligence.

""The first thing was the fundamental architecture change of taking data out of individual PCs and getting them into a centrally managed store. We processed $1.4 trillion of transactions last year, so its super exciting because accounting is such a structured taxonomy and we're getting pretty good results from pretty basic,"" Drury said.

""[Our use of AI] is simplifying accounting and addressing the problem that most people don't know how to do.""

Drury said Xero is working on using more AI in its operations.

""Over the next year or two we'll be able to do more and more.

""The really big move will be moving from accounting where you think 'oh, I must go and do something and walk up to a computer or mobile phone to do it, to the machine telling you what to do next - that's the next generation we'll be showing a whole lot more of next year.""

Drury says its hard to fathom what AI could look like in the long run.

""I don't know how good it will be in five years, I can't even imagine that far out, but what I do know is that in the next two or three years it will radically transform,"" he says. ""What will be quite interesting, and what I think we'll see, is a very human kind of thing where the machine starts thinking for you. Once you've gone through a period of a few months and it's hitting all of your internal boxes then people can become quite reliant on it.

""The big thing for us is we know the technology will take us to a very interesting place. What we need to do is not passively accept the role of humans, we need to actively design that in. It's humans that have purpose, empathy and we have an opportunity as an industry and community to design the human interactions in as we do all the cool technology stuff.""

Brazilian academic Tiberio Caetano started working on machine learning 17 years ago.

""Machine learning has existed as a discipline for at least 40 or 50 years, mostly in laboratories and universities all over the world, it's just now we are at the awakening of machine learning and all the science research that has been developed is having an opportunity to have a significant impact if society,"" Caetano says.

""Data is really the thing that is fuelling predominantly the success of AI now.""

He said we're at a new dawn for AI and what's coming.

Ball says society has never had job losses through the role of automation, but there has one exception.

""If someone sits there and says 'oh a robot is going to take my job', then I really have to wonder what they are doing for work because quite frankly there has only ever been one job that's ever been automated,"" she says.

""The only job that's actually gone completely is the elevator operator.""

Ball says she believes AI and machine learning will allow people to be more human.

""It is going to allow us to spend more time thinking about the big problems in the world; an ageing population, how we find cures for cancer, how we eradicate famine, how we cope with climate change.""

The future of AI and artificial intelligence is bright.

Caetano says the world economy will be transformed dramatically when AI takes full rein.

""The jobs that will exist in 10 years' time will likely be different, and in some areas very different.""

He has no doubts that technology will disrupt the traditional workforce.

In Australia, it is predicted that in five to 10 years, 40 to 60 per cent of all workers will be self-employed.

""The idea of jobs for life is gone,"" Ball says. ""People spend an average of two years at each corporate they work out but now people have side shows that they're turning into start-ups or small businesses.""

Transport, legal, medical, technology, mining and agriculture industries are some of the sectors tipped to see the most disruption by AI and automation in coming years.

Creative sectors are likely to boom as automation and AI becomes more prominent, he says.

Ball says she isn't fazed by the thought of robots and machines taking jobs.

""Computers at the moment are only as good as we train them,"" she says.

""Robots are good at playing simple games and simple moves with simple rules and that's why I don't lose sleep over it.""

Ball says society is going to see incredible changes with AI and automation.

""There are different levels of autonomy and there are different levels of automation, and I actually see there being a bit of a Goldilocks zone in the next five years,"" she says.

Nick Houldsworth, Xero general manager of ecosystem partners, says AI has significant benefits for small business owners.

""For the most part it will be benefits. It is effectively like you're going to have intelligent people in your business taking care of things and helping you make decisions, but ultimately you are the one who designs the strategy for the business.

""At a super macro level humans seem to go through revolutions of some forms of technology in industries every few hundred years, but the pace of these revolutions seems to be getting faster, and inevitably you find that certain industries become less relevant,"" he says.

""I don't think at any point ever in all of human history there has been less for people to do. People are more productive and we've found ways to innovate and create new opportunities.""

AI presents further opportunity for businesses, Houldsworth says.

Xero data shows 35 per cent of small businesses want to grow and more than 60 per cent want to be more efficient and get their life back, Houldsworth says.

Getting into the cloud and becoming digital is a way to do that, he says.

""Take steps to digitalise and find advice, and once you've got your time back, then you can think of what that next stage if growth looks like.

""There's probably a legacy of who people think it's going to be very expensive [to go digital], and that was the case,"" he says. ""If you needed a website 10 years ago, it was $50,000, and on page 90 of Google whereas now you don't even need a website, you can list on Amazon and reach customers.""

He says it is vital for businesses to adopt new technologies for a prosperous future.

""Often your fear of change is out of proportion to the actual effort to do it and the benefits.

""It may not be critical for survival but to unlock the full potential of the business, to enjoy what you do and to have the time to think about what you will do next, it is critical."""
20,20,"Frederick Wiseman's new documentary, ""Ex Libris: The New York Public Library,"" which opens today, revels in the glorious paradox of his half century of directorial work. The modern documentary, born in 1960 with Robert Drew's ""Primary"" and Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's ""Chronicle of a Summer,"" is defined by the presence of the filmmakers. It's a holistic, existential cinema rooted in the filmmakers' shared environment with their subjects -- and in their subjects' conspicuous interaction with, even performance for, the camera. This is true of the work of documentary filmmakers who got their start in the sixties, too, such as the Maysles brothers and D. A. Pennebaker -- but Wiseman, whose first film, ""Titicut Follies,"" dates from 1967, seems to be different.

When editing, Wiseman rigorously excludes his interactions with the film's participants or subjects; he isn't heard talking with them, they aren't heard responding to him, and they aren't seen looking into the lens. Where, then, is Wiseman's presence in his films? Does he embody an ideal of the ""fly on the wall,"" the unnoticed observer whose presence is only a necessary evil of the reporting process?

""Ex Libris,"" a meticulous and wide-ranging three-hour-and-twenty-five-minute display of the library's varied offerings and activities, whether open to the public or occurring behind closed doors, displays the aesthetic power of Wiseman's cinematic practice and the distinctive presence on which his films are based. The work -- his forty-first documentary -- involves far more than the mere fact of directorial decision-making, the selection of subjects and shots, the analytical composition and editorial organization that so evidently distinguishes his films both from passive recording and from less accomplished documentaries.

Beginning and ending with a pair of public discussions in the library's main building, on Fifth Avenue between Fortieth and Forty-second Streets, Wiseman visits branches throughout the city (actually, in Manhattan and the Bronx, because Brooklyn and Queens have their own library systems) and the neighborhoods in which they're located. He shows patrons using the facilities, and librarians and other officials working with them, keeping the libraries running and planning their evolving uses. Along the way, and by way of the things that he sees taking place in and around the New York Public Library, Wiseman is getting at something that is embodied by what he finds and shows, and by the way that he shows it: what he sees inwardly, in his mind's eye. His films are as much a matter of his comprehensive imagination as of his observations.

Wiseman's films have always emphasized and examined institutions, and their titles (whether ""High School"" or ""Hospital,"" ""Welfare"" or ""Model,"" ""Public Housing"" or ""Boxing Gym"" or ""National Gallery"") have made this focus plain. But Wiseman is no mere analyst; in filming institutions, he films the ideas on which they run and the ideas that they embody -- and also the ideals that they're meant to realize and, for that matter, his own ideals, to which these institutions measure up to varying degrees. When Wiseman films an institution, he films the community of people who keep it going, the community where it's placed, the community that it both fosters and serves. His films evoke a sort of utopia, a vision of a society that isn't quite real but that can be -- and that these very institutions are, ever so incrementally and imperfectly, helping to realize. ""Ex Libris"" may be his clearest, most explicit exposition of the principles and activities on which this ideal depends.

""Ex Libris"" is about an ideal of reason and knowledge -- and about the gap between that ideal and what takes place beyond the library's walls. With Wiseman's series of extended scenes of lectures, discussions, and performances (no mere snippets but fully realized sequences that allow ideas to develop), he is also issuing a series of correctives to widespread misconceptions -- whether in opening the film with a scene of Richard Dawkins, speaking in the library's main building, affirming the truth of evolutionary science or, near the film's end, showing a discussion in the Macomb's Bridge Library among patrons and librarians, all of whom are black, about the falsehoods perpetrated in widely disseminated high-school textbooks about enslaved Africans in the United States, who are lumped in among immigrants entering the labor force.

Discussions of the library's central administration are focussed on funding (both private and public), and that quest for financing is aimed principally at the ongoing reshaping of the library's mission toward education. The library's president, Anthony Marx, emphasizes that the new century's informational frontier is digitalization and universal access to information, and he emphasizes that the purpose of this transformation is essentially political and democratic, declaring his belief that widespread access to information is central to reducing inequality. (He also is keenly concerned with the financing on which this project depends.)

Yet he also emphasizes, subtly but firmly, the library's other core mission -- the preservation and dissemination of the esoterica or arcana of culture and science for the purpose of fostering future scholarship.

Observing the library in its daily functions, Wiseman suggests an essential connection between the nuts and bolts of universal education and the highest realms of scholarship. A branch's discussion of educational materials for students in a largely nonwhite and immigrant neighborhood appears, in Wiseman's vision, as much a matter of social progress and self-determination as a range of scholarly library events, such as a lecture regarding nineteenth-century political philosophers' views of slavery, a talk by a social historian about the political role of food in the integration and increased acceptance of Jewish immigrant families at a time of forceful anti-Semitism, and a public discussion by Ta-Nehisi Coates calling for a redefinition and reorientation of rhetoric about ""black-on-black crime.""

Throughout ""Ex Libris,"" Wiseman's political vision comes through with sharp and clear lines. He emphasizes the connection between knowledge and power -- and between culture and power. In a public discussion at the library, the poet Yusef Komunyakaa, asked about the politics of his poetry, answers, ""Language is political."" Khalil Gibran Muhammad, the former director of the Schomburg Center, cites Toni Morrison's reference to libraries as ""pillars of our democracy,"" and suggests that libraries play a crucial role in preparing for what John Lewis called ""necessary trouble"" -- protest, and the awareness of the conditions that call for it. The very subject of ""Ex Libris"" is the development and sustenance of an informed citizenry and an informed electorate, and Wiseman's point is that an institution that preserves, fosters, and disseminates scientific and humanistic knowledge enables ordinary people to make reasonable decisions about their lives and about the country at large. (It's also a matter of practical reason and empowerment, as in scenes showing readers using library computers and microforms to research colorectal cancer and to lodge a complaint about bank fraud.)

""Ex Libris"" is a vision of a virtual utopia of knowledge rendered accessible, and, like almost all utopian visions, it veers at times toward sentimentality. Like many films involving libraries, it also veers toward sanctimony regarding the fundamental value of reading, of consuming and producing culture. (After all, plenty of illiberals write theses, too.) Wiseman is very much at home in the discourse of bureaucracy and administration, of managers sustaining the institution with respectful consideration of diverging forces and interests, positioning it with respect to electoral politics and personal relationships while keeping focus squarely on the library's mission and values. The movie's air of benign, benevolent calm suggests at times the sense of an official culture of impersonal gentility. If there's a shadow to the splendor and the clarity of Wiseman's idealistic intellectual vision, it's the need for something other than the sweetness of angels.

Despite its celebration of cultural treasures, there's little sense that much of the best art is made by people too wild or disreputable to spend time in libraries, even if their work ends up there long after they're dead. For all its documentary ardor, Wiseman's ideal often takes precedence over the real, and the one thing that never comes through is the reason why the devil gets the good lines."

An Ottawa mother says she wants public libraries across Canada to consider setting up an adults-only computer section after her two daughters were exposed to hard-core pornography at their local branch this summer.

The incident, first reported by CBC News, occurred in July as the family was visiting Ottawa's Greenboro library.

Story continues below

Jennifer St. Pierre had brought her daughters, 11 and 13, to the facility to pick out some reading material when one of them reported that she'd seen a man watching something ""inappropriate"" on a nearby computer.

READ MORE: Is enough being done to protect children from viewing pornography online?

""I was standing at the shelf behind him, and I could see that he was on a porn site ... so I just quickly went to the library desk and let the lady know and we left right away,"" St. Pierre said.

""I was in shock. I couldn't believe that that's what he was watching.""

She was even more disturbed to learn that the Ottawa Public Library's official position was that the man (who was over 18) was within his rights to access legal pornography on the computer system -- even though he was in a high-traffic area.

""I think there should be firewalls in place, or at the very least there should be somewhere, an alcove,"" said St. Pierre. ""My 13-year-old's books are put in an alcove off to the side where she goes to look, but this guy is sitting on the main floor.""

Censorship?

The St. Pierre family's experience has prompted broader questions surrounding which side should win out when there's a conflict between individual freedoms and the safety and comfort of others in public spaces.

WATCH: Why it's important to talk with teens about pornography

According to the library's chief executive officer, Danielle McDonald, the library does, in fact, have filters in place on its wi-fi and wired computer systems that target illegal material like child pornography.

""However, we are not in the business of censorship,"" McDonald confirmed in an emailed statement.

""The (Ottawa Public Library) aims to strike a balance between customer privacy, intellectual freedom, and the safety and security of our spaces, but there are times when it can be challenging ... We recognize that there are varying points of view on this matter, and that not everyone will agree with the position of the OPL. It is, however, a fundamental tenant of a public library to uphold access to information without censorship.""

The number of incidents of users accessing what could be considered ""inappropriate"" material (legal porn, graphic violence, etc.) fell from 15 in 2015 to three so far in 2017, she added.

Similar policies in Halifax, Toronto

Libraries across Canada have various policies in place when it comes to porn being accessed via their computers. Toronto and Halifax, for instance, follow Ottawa's lead and do not censor online content unless the computer terminal is specifically designated for children.

""There is no perfect filter that would filter only illegal material,"" noted Michelle Leung of the Toronto Public Library.

""For example, a pornography filter might block critical information about breast cancer.""

Most libraries do, however, enforce a blanket rule that forbids behaviour which could be deemed ""disruptive"" or ""unsafe,"" or actions that affect the enjoyment of the library in a general sense.

That could easily be applied to publicly viewing porn, in which case staff can intervene and ask the user to stop what they're doing. For the most part, said Leung, people will comply.

WATCH: Lethbridge library handing out lifetime bans to curb drug problem

In Halifax, library staff similarly reserve the right to end Internet sessions when ""inappropriate"" material is displayed.

""It is relatively rare that we receive complaints,"" said Halifax Regional Library spokesperson Kasia Morrison, adding that staff regularly roam through the library spaces and handle situations as they arise.

Criminal behaviour

The Criminal Code applies inside a library just as it does anywhere else, so accessing or distributing child pornography or obscene materials (as defined by law) can be immediately reported to the police by library staff.

The Criminal Code also includes provisions that target public indecency or public mischief, explained criminal lawyer Michael Spratt, which could potentially be used to crack down on users who access pornography in public areas, particularly those frequented by children.

""I think that we can all agree that it's not right to expose children, especially in a place of learning, to things that are indecent or graphic or not appropriate,"" he said.

But, Spratt cautioned, it's also important to consider freedom of speech and access to information issues. Rushing to lay charges may not be the most effective approach in every situation.

""This is not a black and white area; As much of the law is, it's a grey area,"" he said. ""The Criminal Code is a very poor and blunt tool to bring about social change or enact social policy.""

For her part, St. Pierre said she has an open and honest dialogue with her daughters about sexuality, but ""they were seeing things that they never would have heard of"" that day in the library.

She wants other parents to be aware of the possibility, however slim, that they could find themselves in a similar situation.

""Be prepared to talk about it, because it can happen."""
22,22,"Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news) 's new ""spaceship"" headquarters peeked above a nearby hillside as the sun shined gloriously through towering glass walls of the entryway to Steve Jobs Theater.

The smell of freshly turned soil was heavy in the warming air even as the site was inaugurated with the unveiling of a 10th anniversary iPhone at Apple Park in Silicon Valley.

""Apple Park has been built to reflect Apple's values for technology and the environment,"" chief executive Tim Cook said after paying tribute to late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs at the first-ever media event at the new campus Tuesday.

""The park itself was converted from a sea of asphalt to a green space with more than 9,000 trees; designed to be transparent with nature and bring the outside in.""

Glass walls give the feeling of remaining in nature even after stepping inside.

Plants and trees taking root throughout the grand campus are native to California, and drought-resistant.

All the electricity needed to run the campus comes from an on-site solar power system, one of the largest in the world.

- Steve's 'baby' -

Light streams down onto a curved stairway made of gold-toned stone leading down to Steve Jobs Theater built into the hill.

""Steve Jobs was an incredibly detail-oriented person, and this was his baby,"" said Creative Strategies analyst and Silicon Valley veteran Tim Bajarin.

""This should be a crown jewel in the sense of design.""

Apple Park was created with ""extraordinary attention to detail and materials,"" according to Cook.

A visitors center that will open to the public later this year features an augmented reality experience to virtually explore the campus.

About six months ago, workers began boarding the futuristic new campus, fulfilling a vision set out by Jobs, the company's late founder.

The process of moving more than 12,000 people to a new campus that Jobs envisioned as a ""center for creativity and collaboration"" was expected to continue late into the year.

A theater on the new Apple Park campus was named in honor of Jobs, who died six years ago after a battle with pancreatic cancer.

""Steve's vision for Apple stretched far beyond his time with us,"" Cook said in a release earlier this year.

""He intended Apple Park to be the home of innovation for generations to come.""

- 'Staggering' -

The 175-acre (70-hectare) campus with a ring-shaped main building clad in giant panels of curved glass blends workspaces and parkland.

""I was amazed at the landscape,"" Bajarin said after leaving Apple Park.

""It was staggering how huge the campus is.""

The ring design is aimed at fostering better collaboration among those working inside.

""It is a unique design; very different that what you think of with a Silicon Valley campus,"" analyst Bajarin said.

""We are used to campuses where there are multistory buildings close together -- Apple broke with convention.""

Campus features include a fitness center, foot paths, research labs and an orchard.

""We have approached the design, engineering and making of our new campus with the same enthusiasm and design principles that characterize our products,"" Apple chief design officer Jony Ive said in a statement.

Apple celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. The Silicon Valley legend sprang out of Jobs's garage to reshape modern life with trend-setting gadgets.

Jobs, a tech-savvy marketing genius, and Steve Wozniak, who invented the Apple computer, formed what would become the world's largest corporation with eye-popping annual profits.

The two college dropouts created the company that has changed the way people use computers, listen to music, communicate on the go, and made people at home in a world of ""apps"" tailored for work, play, education, health and more.

Apple's hit products command a cult-like following, long after the company's humble beginning in Jobs's Cupertino, California garage on April 1, 1976.

The new campus is in Cupertino as well, with the Jobs Theater on a hilltop overlooking meadows and the main building.

""Steve (Jobs) was exhilarated, and inspired, by the California landscape, by its light and its expansiveness,"" his widow Laurene Powell Jobs said.

""It was his favorite setting for thought. Apple Park captures his spirit uncannily well.""

Cook began the first-ever media event in the theater with a tribute to Steve Jobs, whose image and words were shared with the audience.

""I love gearing his voice, and his inspiring message,"" Cook said.

""We dedicated this theater to Steve because we loved him and because he loved days like this.""

23,23,"Cloudflare's joint research with ""a large e-commerce site"" and Mozilla found that between 4-10% of secure, encrypted web connections are ""intercepted,"" largely by corporate antivirus software that inserts its own certificates into users' browsers, allowing it to scan all traffic entering workers' computers.

This kind of workplace surveillance is often hand-waved away by capitalist bootlicker apologists who say that you should expect no privacy while using employer-provided equipment (I think this is bullshit: you'd be pissed if discovered that your private lunch break parking-lot conversation with your spouse about your cancer diagnosis was secretly recorded by your employer's hidden mics; your employer's man-in-the-middle attack on your personal Gmail traffic during your lunch break is no more acceptable).

But even if you're OK with the idea of your employer spying on you, there's the matter of overall security: man-in-the-middling browsers significantly reduces their security.

In addition to the ""legitimate"" workplace surveillance and other anti-virus/anti-malware interceptions, Cloudflare detected a large amount of ""unknown"" interceptions it attributed to malware.

The net result of using bad crypto, illustrated below, is that it opens up weaker connections to attacks. Hackers could also intercept encrypted connections and steal confidential data such as credentials, instant messages, and emails. In certain cases, like Komodia, the cryptographic implementation is so broken that an attacker can intercept any encrypted communication with little effort.

To quantify how HTTPS interception affects connection security, we analyzed the security of the cryptographic stacks used by these interceptors. Overall, we found that 65% of the intercepted connections going to the Firefox update server have reduced security, and a staggering 37% are easily vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks due to blatant cryptographic mistakes (e.g., certificates are not validated). As reported in the chart above, while a little better, the numbers for Cloudflare are still concerning: 45% of the intercepted connections to Cloudflare have decreased security, and 16% are severely broken. Finally, the numbers for the e-commerce website sit in between: 62.3% have reduced security and 18% are severely broken.

Mr Hunt said: 'So what might medicine look like when the NHS is 80 [in 2028]? Well, the first thing is we may well not be going to doctors for a diagnosis, we might be going to computers instead'.

Artificial intelligence could help in diagnosing patients by analysing X-rays and samples to determine conditions such as cancer, according to NHS England bosses.

In as little as a decade's time, patients may even be diagnosed with disorders before they develop symptoms as DNA screening is set to become accessible to the masses, Mr Hunt said.

The future will also see patients being able to declare their wishes about sensitive subjects such as organ donation and end-of-life care through apps, Mr Hunt added.

Patients may one day be diagnosed by computers, not doctors, according to Jeremy Hunt

ROBOTS COULD SOON CARE FOR DEMENTIA PATIENTS

Robots could soon be caring for dementia patients, a Lancet Commission report suggested in July.

Technological advancements mean gadgets and apps are already being introduced into dementia care.

Devices like GPS trackers are used to ensure patients do not get lost, while monitors in the home can detect falls and tell if the phone or television is being used, which then sends this information back to family and carers.

Some dementia patients wear smartwatches, which collect data on their sleep and eating patterns, blood pressure and sugar levels for analysis by doctors, researchers and carers.

And interactive technology, including virtual reality, and specialised apps and computer games, have been introduced to care homes to help calm patients with dementia.

Electronic calendars and speaking reminders can also help patients tell the time or remind them to do simple tasks such as washing their hands.

'We may well not be going to doctors for a diagnosis'

Speaking at the NHS Expo conference in Manchester, Mr Hunt said: 'The changes in medical innovation are likely to transform humanity by as much in the next 25 years as the internet has in the last 25 years.

'So what might medicine look like when the NHS is 80 [in 2028]? Well, the first thing is we may well not be going to doctors for a diagnosis, we might be going to computers instead, who will be looking at the 300,000 biomarkers in every single drop of blood, mashing that with big data information about everyone else's biomarkers.

'And when we do go to a doctor, he or she may will be comparing your medical record with our fully sequenced genome and giving us much more accurate predictive information.

'We may be in a world where if we show any symptoms of a disease, we consider that a sign of failure - because the name of the game will be to catch diseases when we are asymptomatic and we have a much better chance of being able to nip illness in the bud.'

Mr Hunt also wants patients to be able to view their GP interactions on an app 'as simply as you can look at your entire order history on Amazon.'

He also hopes patients can one day declare their preferences for end-of-life care and organ donation through apps.

Mr Hunt said: 'In organ donation where there is a big debate about opt-out and opt-in, we think that it should be as easy as loading up an app on your smartphone to change your preference.

'We are very keen to boost the number of organs that are available for transplant and we think this is a very easy way to do that and gives us the opportunity to prompt people to express a preference actively through technology that they might not otherwise do.

'And this is going to take a bit longer to get right but this also gives us the opportunity for people to express their end-of-life preferences online and in particular that crucial piece of information as to whether people would prefer to die at home or in a hospital setting.

'If we can get that information early enough and get it agreed early enough then it means we can give a much better end-of-life experience.'

Artificial intelligence could help in diagnosing NHS patients by analysing their X-rays

'AI is better than doctors at diagnosing certain conditions'

NHS England medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh said: 'We know from a number of studies that have been done that in certain circumstances AI is better than doctors at diagnosing certain conditions.

'It's possible that certain types - and there are many different types of AI - will be able to read X-rays. I've been told by people who are developing this sort of stuff that's within a four-year time frame.

'All of this takes us into very new territory and it's not a long way over there, it's actually here now.'

NHS chief executive Simon Stevens told delegates: 'We have great opportunity to get smarter about the way we are using AI and machine learning with data sets to improve the quality of clinical care.'

Mr Stevens added NHS England will be investing funds into the development of AI over the next year."
25,25,"The new cohost of 'SportsCenter' and her partner, Michael Smith, have been blamed for the network's perceived liberal bias. Should they embrace debate or block the trolls? Hill shares her side.

One afternoon in June, Jemele Hill and Michael Smith were sitting in a small green room at ESPN headquarters. It was an hour before the start of the 6 p.m. SportsCenter. But for my presence, they were alone  --  away from producers offering notes, prying executives, and the outraged wails of social media.

Hill and Smith meet here every day. They don't rehearse the show, exactly. They map out the trajectories of each other's arguments and try out lines. It's like telling a joke to a friend in the adjoining cubicle and asking, ""Should I tweet that?""

Today, the topic was where free agent Gordon Hayward should sign.

""What is it  --  Miami, Boston?"" Hill asked.

""Honestly, that feels like an easy choice to me,"" Smith said.

""Miami will always be in the recruiting game. Because Miami.""

""That's a whack-ass reason to sign somewhere.""

""Brother living in Utah for four years,"" Hill said. ""That's all I'm saying.""

""Boston is a thriving metropolis,"" Smith said with a touch of civic pride. Before coming to ESPN, he was a reporter at the Globe.

Hill said: ""Last thing I need is Boston on my back ..."" She was once suspended by ESPN for comparing rooting for the Celtics to having sympathy for Hitler.

A joke had popped into Hill's head, and she was deciding whether to use it.

She did: ""We're talking about white dudes. That's a different experience. [Boston] might be like Miami for them.""

""Precisely,"" Smith said. ""That's mecca right there! Shit's lit!""

An hour later, on SportsCenter, Hill and Smith rebooted their debate for the cameras. Smith said, ""Boston is a thriving metropolis,"" and Hill repeated that she didn't need a few million angry Bostonians on her back. But I noticed they never used the joke that cracked them up in the green room.

This is the irony of the show ESPN calls SC6 or simply The Six. When Hill tweets about Donald Trump, some of Twitter's noisiest critics like to complain about what she and Smith are doing to SportsCenter. But if you talk to Hill and Smith, you find them asking the opposite question: What's the franchise doing to them?

""Because we're SportsCenter, we overthink a lot,"" Hill told me. ""We're like, 'Does this fit the SportsCenter brand?' 'Would this be OK?' It's not [ESPN executives]  --  they're not putting pressure on us to do that. It's just we're in our own heads about it. ... That's some of the downside of how the label can suffocate you.""

This tension  --  between being the fearless opinion-slinger ESPN hired and honoring the legacy of a venerable franchise  --  isn't just the kind of thing that's on Jemele Hill's mind. It's the very dilemma of the network she's trying to help reinvent.

These days, if someone is mad online at ESPN, chances are they're also mad at Hill. Why won't she stick to sports? Why is she so ""liberal?"" Why are she and Michael defiling the temple of Dan and Keith? To just about every critic, Hill is a debate-show avatar rather than an actual person  --  one who has found her first six months on the network's flagship show to be thrilling and bewildering in equal doses. I wondered: Who is she?

A little after 9:30 that morning, after an interview on Mike & Mike, Hill was talking to Mike Greenberg off-camera. She was wearing flip-flops and a T-shirt with a picture of Doughboy from Boyz n the Hood. (""I remember the movie from the theaters,"" Greenberg said on the air, like a man insisting on a level of cultural cred.)

Hill has made it her mission to teach Greenberg the occasional bit of slang. Once, she told him that morning, she and Cari Champion appeared on ESPN in short skirts. ""As the young kids say, you got to let the lambos out,"" Hill told Greenberg. She added: ""You can use that.""

When Hill and I were out of earshot, I told her there was no chance Greenberg would use ""let the lambos out.""

""Oh, no, he 100 percent would,"" Hill said. Two years ago, when Hill was on Mike & Mike, Greenberg blurted out another phrase Hill taught him: ""Is the mid still sellin'?"" Hill cracked up, and Greenberg got a panicked look on his face. ""Did I use it correctly?"" he said. ""Was that not an appropriate mention of it?"" Hill forgot to tell him it was a reference to weed.

A few hours after Mike & Mike, Hill walked into SC6's morning staff meeting and met Smith, the man who fondly calls her his work wife. Michael and Jemele were first pitched as a romantic item. In 2002 they spotted each other across the Celtics locker room. Hill was covering the NBA for the Detroit Free Press, Smith for the Globe. Rob Parker, who was then a columnist in Detroit, thought they were so similar in their youthful ambition that they might be a couple.

Accompanied by Parker and the writer A. Sherrod Blakely, Smith and Hill went to a screening of Spider-Man. They were seated next to each other, like shy middle schoolers. At the end of the night, they exchanged numbers.

""If there's one thing he has over me,"" Hill said, ""it's that I called first."" She was coming to Boston to cover the playoffs, she told Smith. What was there to do around town?

Smith said he didn't go out much.

Hill said: ""OK, let me be more forward then. Do you want to go grab dinner or go hang out somewhere?""

On the set of SC6, as they were on their old ESPN2 show, His & Hers, Hill and Smith are a matched set. In person, you can see their differences more clearly. Smith is all verbal output  --  the grandson of a minister who's forever on the verge of his next sermon. ""I'm a ponderer,"" Hill said. ""I stew."" Even on TV, you see her taking a half-second to calculate her response to Smith, to size up where he's going. Cari Champion calls her Suffers in Silence.

Both Hill and Smith are known as mentors at ESPN, especially for the network's young black employees. But Hill has a gift for attracting friends. ""There's a competition to see who's her best friend,"" Smith said. Smith figures he's no. 2 in the rankings, behind only Kelley L. Carter, an Undefeated writer who was Hill's roommate in college. He begged me not to tell him if I found out differently.

Behind Hill's warm smile lurks the heart of a pessimist  --  someone who doesn't necessarily think everything at ESPN is going to turn out alright. Once, she thought Smith was rolling over in negotiations with executives. ""For somebody who is very direct about how they think,"" Hill told him, ""you're the most accommodating motherfucker ever.""

ESPN's transformation is usually described as swapping a highlight for a debate segment. But the changes are even more elemental than that. At the SC6 staff meeting, everyone had their heads buried in their social media feeds, looking for content for the show. ""I'm a hawk on TweetDeck,"" said Jeremy Lundblad, one of SC6's producers.

Twitter is now the de facto coordinating producer of ESPN's daytime lineup. The network's old currency was a highlight of Klay Thompson shooting a 3. The new currency  --  and, indeed, that day's top offering  --  was a video of Thompson dancing like a dork in a Chinese nightclub. Programming ESPN is like curating your Twitter feed: find the content that everyone's talking about and craft the right joke.

The Thompson video gave Hill an idea of how they could open that night's episode of SC6. They would show Thompson dancing, then cut to a video of Smith dancing with Bell Biv DeVoe at an ESPYs party.

On the air, Hill called Smith and Thompson members of the ""light-skinned delegation.""

Smith merrily shot back: ""Why you act like you black as the ace of spades?""

That kind of banter is exactly what filled His & Hers, which aired every day at noon. It's radically different than almost anything that has appeared on SportsCenter. Last fall, after ESPN executives tapped Hill and Smith to host the 6 p.m. edition, they began to realize their mission was more than just creating a good show  --  it was working against 40 years of accumulated nostalgia, against the idea that a show called SportsCenter ought to be done a certain way.

One of the first things Hill and Smith did was ask if they could change the show's title. Maybe call it something like SportsCenter Presents His & Hers. Management said no. ""I will fully cop to having a strong SportsCenter bias,"" Rob King, the executive in charge of the franchise, told me. The idea was to overhaul the brand rather than scrap it.

At times, it felt like ESPN was tearing an ACL in its attempts to tell cord-cutting millennials that SC6 was their kind of show. For weeks, the network ran an ad campaign that promised ""Sports Music Movies + More.""

""ESPN, they were well-intentioned,"" Hill said. ""Their heart was in the right place. But when you roll out a campaign that says, 'Sports Music Movies + More,' you give people the idea that when we come out of the gate, we're going to be doing television upside down. ... Are we? We are doing a sports discussion show.""

It's true that Hill and Smith are pop culture fanatics. In June, when the rapper Prodigy died, they quoted his lyrics to each other on the air. They interviewed Love & Basketball director Gina Prince-Bythewood, which prompted a burp of protest from Fox Sports agitator Clay Travis. After they produced grand parodies of Empire and Anchorman, the March 10 edition of The Six began with the opening credits of A Different World.

But if you watch SC6 every day, you realize pop culture is more often Hill and Smith's go-to reference rather than their actual subject. When critics complain that they're mixing genres, Smith hears the ring of a double standard. ""When Bill Simmons does it, he's celebrated for it ..."" he told me. ""When [Scott] Van Pelt does it, he's awesome, he's everyman, we relate to him. When Barstool does it, they're anti-establishment, they're new, they're fresh, they're the anti-ESPN.

""When we do it? 'Get this black shit out of here!' That's what it feels like.""

Here, Stuart Scott's example is instructive. When he died of cancer, in 2015, he was hailed for bringing a new sensibility to SportsCenter. But in Scott's early years at ESPN, critics greeted him with reactions that ranged from sneering to incomprehension. In 2001, the Chicago Sun-Times' Richard Roeper wrote a whole column scolding Scott for saying ""boo ya!"" because the catchphrase had its origins in gang violence.

Scott ""stayed true to himself so that me and Jemele could stay true to ourselves,"" Smith said. Now, ""boo ya!"" is scribbled on SC6's video backdrop as a memorial and a kind of rallying cry.

In the morning meeting where Hill and Smith sorted through the day's news, they also broached the trickiness of the time slot. The 6 p.m. SportsCenter has always been positioned at an inconvenient spot in the sports day: too late to cover last night's games and too early to cover tonight's. ""What I have at midnight are results,"" said Van Pelt. ""At 6, all you have are topics.""

Topics are why Hill and Smith were tapped for the gig, which began in February. But they were still trying to figure out their responsibility to the news. A Woj bomb that dropped at 5:30 would rightly require them to change the lineup. But what if The New York Times posted a mildly interesting news story while SC6 was on the air  --  were they supposed to stop and read it? ""What is our obligation to tell people news that just happened even if we're supposed to be a discussion show?"" Hill asked. ""I don't know. We haven't figured that out yet.""

SC6's format was tweaked after I visited this summer. In the opening ""Six at 6"" segment, Hill and Smith blitz through a list of news items, highlights, and social media offerings. The segment helped the show's pacing, and it created a place for Hill and Smith to talk about a great catch from a day baseball game or Le'Veon Bell rapping about his teammates  --  stuff they knew should be a part of the 6 p.m. SportsCenter but didn't always have a spot for.

Every debate show on ESPN has topic bars  --  blocks at the bottom of the TV screen where you can see what burning question the hosts are chewing over. (The idea is that ESPN can be watched with the sound off.) Hill and Smith were told that SC6 couldn't have topic bars, because that wasn't how SportsCenter was supposed to look. Later in the summer, the decision was reversed, and now Hill and Smith have topic bars.

After the staff meeting, Hill and Smith ate lunch in the ESPN cafeteria, then sat side by side at computers in a noisy room called ""Screening."" They call themselves ""former journalists,"" in deference to their print colleagues, but they write their own scripts. A few hours later, they mapped out their debates in the green room. Just before 6, Hill was sitting on the cavernous SC6 set, which ESPN says is designed to evoke a loft space. Smith looked at the camera and asked, ""What's good?""

""This is a pretty big shift from the Lindsay Czarniak SportsCenter,"" said Bomani Jones. ""There's a picture of Bob Marley and a picture of Jordan 6s in the background. It's SportsCenter being done in the image and personality of the hosts, all the way down to the set.""

""If we struggle in any area with SportsCenter, it's because we're still trying to be all things to all people,"" Smith said. ""We're trying to keep that person that's just not gonna be kept, no matter how hard we try, in 2017. And we gotta let go of that. We gotta just be Michael and Jemele.""

Hill cast the process of reimagining SC6 as a search for identity. ""You know what First Take is,"" she said. ""Debate show. Highly Questionable, you know what that is. Around the Horn, PTI. They have a set identity. We can debate whether it works or doesn't work, but you know what the identity is. What is the identity of SportsCenter?""

Hill was born in Detroit in 1975. In 1980, she and her mother, Denise Dennard, moved to Houston. As Dennard was leaving work, she was pulled into a van at gunpoint and raped. Dennard had been sexually abused as a child, and Hill watched as the incident sent her into a spiral. Dennard couldn't sleep with the lights out. She kept a knife and a bat and a 12-gauge shotgun under her bed. ""If I couldn't get to one, I could get to the other,"" Dennard said. ""Nobody was going to hurt me and my baby.""

Years later, Dennard realized she was living with undiagnosed PTSD. But as a black woman living near the poverty line, she got no help from family or government agencies. She and Hill had to fend for themselves. ""It was God and her and I,"" Dennard said.

To cope, Dennard turned to prescription pain medication. Hill, who wasn't yet a teenager, became a voyeur to her mother's addiction. Back in Detroit, they would get into Dennard's Chevette, and drive to Linwood Avenue. From the passenger seat, Hill could see dealers hawking their wares by putting up fingers. Two fingers for Tylenol 2, three for Tylenol 3. She sat in the car while her mom scored.

Other times, Hill followed her mom into strange apartments. Dennard would walk into a back bedroom and shut the door while she scored. Hill waited patiently as if she was sitting outside a fitting room while her mom tried on a new top.

Once, Hill got a TV from her grandmother for her birthday. Dennard pawned it to buy more pills. ""I told her I did it,"" Dennard said. ""I told her it was me. I said, 'Never let anybody else do this to you.'"" Before her senior year of high school, Hill got so sick of her mom's antics that she spent the year living with her grandmother in the black, middle-class suburb of Southfield.

Dennard was on and off welfare for years. To survive, she cleaned apartments. She told Hill, who was tagging along, to sit still and behave. One of Dennard's clients was an 80-year-old man who subscribed to the Detroit News and Free Press. Hill was a sports fan, a tomboy who impressed the neighborhood boys with her arm at shortstop. While Dennard cleaned she lost herself in the papers' sports pages.

Hill also began to write in journals, composing stories and novels. It was creativity learned as a defense mechanism. Writing allowed Hill to imagine an alternate universe where her mom wasn't on drugs and didn't live in a constant state of terror.

""I really blamed myself the whole time for her childhood,"" Dennard said. ""Of course I apologized to her upon sobriety. But I always felt that guilt. No kid should have to live through that.""

Dennard got clean in her 40s and now is close to earning her master's degree. Hill calls her the bravest person she knows  --  something I heard more than one ESPNer say about Hill. When she got the SC6 job, Hill bought Dennard a Mercedes-Benz C300. Dennard said she loves the car because it means her daughter loves her.

Friends who met Hill later noticed that she described the traumas of her childhood with a certain distance, a kind of formal remove, almost as if she had been serving as her own therapist. Hill would regard her critics the same way. ""Her toughness is well-guarded, well-earned, and well-deserved,"" Dennard said. ""Because it's a tough damn world out there.""

Hill was hired by ESPN, in 2006, to write a column for Page 2. But she soon found herself on the people mover that carries network talent toward TV hits. Hill noted the irony: Once ESPN ""embraced debate,"" its future was being written not by young broadcasters pouring out of Syracuse but by print veterans who never imagined they'd be on TV at all.

""At the time,"" Hill said of ESPN, ""the hot ticket was black guy-white guy."" Stephen A. and Skip on First Take. Mike and Tony on PTI. Hill felt that sensibility made it harder for her and Smith to get their own show, because, in the TV programming shorthand of the period, there was a sense they either looked or thought too much alike.

As a woman, Hill faced another roadblock. She noticed that while women were slinging opinions as panelists on The Sports Reporters, they were reduced to a particular role when cast on a debate show: guiding the show in and out of commercials, teeing up the male panelists, and occasionally saying, ""Settle down, guys!""

Bomani Jones told me: ""Part of the bargain you're going to get here is people will be screaming at your avatar on television. You're not even a human being to them. It can be frustrating at times. But as much as I get it, I'm still a man. Discussing sports is a level of privilege afforded to me. People may not like my perspective, but they still think I'm entitled to have it and express it on this platform by virtue of this penis I have.

""As a woman,"" Jones said of Hill, ""she has to shake off people who have convinced themselves they watch sports to escape their wives or girlfriends. She's catching it worse than anybody else.""

During this period, Hill called herself ESPN's ""crash-test dummy."" She would audition for jobs she felt she had no shot at getting. She tried out for the spot on First Take that went to Champion and the spot on SportsNation that went to Michelle Beadle. In 2010 Smith pitched a show that would feature three black hosts: Smith, Hill, and Bomani Jones. ""They said, 'Here's Charissa Thompson,'"" Hill told me. ""No disrespect to her, obviously ...""

""As a black woman,"" Hill said, ""I'm looking around television  --  not just at ESPN but in general  --  [and I'm seeing] a whole lot of blondes. I'm like, I ain't blonde and I ain't white. So I don't know what my future is in this business. Because they are not checking for me.""

ESPN, Hill felt, saw her more as a utility infielder than a franchise player. ""I thought I'd probably wind up leaving ESPN sooner rather than later,"" she said. Hill wondered whether she might have more elbow room at a cable news network  --  a destination where some of her friends think she may still end up one day.

In 2013 Hill and Smith decided to make an end run around TV altogether. They started a podcast called His & Hers. That March, Hill and Smith recorded a podcast about the Steubenville rape case in which Hill talked about the time she narrowly escaped being raped by a family friend. As she would on TV, Hill took a tricky topic that was dominating the airwaves and made it disarmingly personal.

In 2011 Smith got a show, becoming a host of ESPN2's Numbers Never Lie. Hill's fate was left to a series of chance events. In 2013, when Jalen Rose left Numbers Never Lie, Hill became a cohost. The next year, after cohost Hugh Douglas was fired in part for reportedly calling Smith an ""Uncle Tom,"" Hill and Smith finally had their own show. ESPN president John Skipper rechristened it His & Hers.

Years later, trolls of a certain political bent would imply that Hill had fallen into the SportsCenter job. Hill saw her rise more glumly, as if she had triumphed within a system that in many ways was stacked against her. As she put it to me, ""I won the war of attrition.""

Hill and Smith expected a certain blowback when they got SC6. ""We knew when we moved into this neighborhood that there were going to be people that wanted us to turn our music down,"" Smith said. They didn't expect the blowback to be this loud. In April, when Yahoo's Daniel Roberts published a story about ESPN, he noted that about half of the 3,000 comments were about Hill and Smith. They weren't even the subject of the piece.

Before the SC6 staff meeting, Smith sat in an empty conference room ticking off the reasons why he and Hill might have been singled out. ""It could be who we are and how we look,"" he said. ""Another [reason] could be ... there's a certain segment of sports fans that just want their sports. They don't want your pop culture conversations, they don't want your social conversations, they don't want your political conversations.""

""It could be because she's a woman,"" Smith said. ""I don't want to leave that out.""

Smith admitted that some segment of viewers had given SC6 a fair shot and just thought it didn't work. ""I'm not arrogant enough to think that's not a significant number of people,"" he said.

I asked Smith about one of the show's loudest critics: Kirk Minihane, a Boston radio host who called SC6 ""dogshit."" Smith, who lived in Boston for years, told me he had never heard of Minihane.

Hill said that Clay Travis  --  who in March ventured a theory about Disney CEO Bob Iger's political plans based on when Iger followed Hill on Twitter  --  is nothing like the writer she met during her newspaper days. ""I feel like he's playing a character ..."" she said. ""It's almost like a wrestling heel."" She added: ""I would just like to know if he can generate any kind of traffic without ESPN's name in his mouth.""

Beyond its critics, SC6 suffered from three separate instances of bad timing. The show debuted the day after the Super Bowl, depriving Hill and Smith of football content for six months. (Ratings for the 6 p.m. SportsCenter are lower than they were last year, but ESPN says the show's audience is now younger and more diverse.)

Then, in April, ESPN laid off about 100 staffers, including many hosts and writers. ""When the faces of ESPN are changing,"" Smith said, ""or people you like are shown the door for people that you don't, that's going to elicit a visceral, emotional reaction.""

As Ed Werder has observed, the ESPN layoffs didn't proceed strictly according to merit. But you only have to dip into a comments section to see how this sentiment can take on a sinister edge: as if the ESPNers left in Bristol are somehow unworthy of being there, or as if Hill hung on to her job only because of ""affirmative action.""

""There's a certain crop of people who's not trying to see ESPN get more ethnic, more gender-balanced ..."" Hill said. ""As a discredit to all of us, they use words like too 'liberal' or too 'politically correct.' As if there's ever been this widespread movement in television to just give black people and women shows. No, it's been the exact opposite.""

She continued: ""That term is funny: 'social justice warriors.' What are they talking about? ... Whenever I hear that, I'm like, I know what you really want to call me.""

The final bit of bad timing was the most dramatic. SC6 debuted 17 days after the inauguration of the man Smith calls ""President Business."" Donald Trump's election did something ESPN's occasional right-wing critics could not: It pulled the network fully into a political vortex. Now, for the first time in its history, ESPN is accused of being an arm of the failing, liberal media, the sports equivalent of CNN or The New York Times  --  a.k.a. the enemy.

Smith calls the network's Trumpist critics, the ones that homed in on SC6, Make ESPN Great Again. ""It just went to another level that even we were not prepared for in many respects,"" Hill said. ""I don't know if ESPN was prepared for it, either.""

Just about everyone in Bristol has offered Hill advice about how to deal with social media. Mike Greenberg said that tangling with the nastiest critics is to risk  --  here's a 2017 word  --  ""normalizing"" the hate. Cari Champion, who was once the target of comedian Artie Lange's slavemaster fantasy, reminded Hill that one of her greatest TV assets was her authenticity  --  reading too many tweets could make her overthink what she says.

But this is where Hill refuses to suffer in silence. ""I'll put my record for people deleting their tweets up against anybody's at ESPN,"" she said. ""I get an enormous satisfaction when I see somebody delete a tweet. And if I make you delete your account, I'm throwing a party. That's even better. I'm like, I'm running you out of this social media neighborhood. You're not running me out of it.""

On Monday night, Hill tweeted that Trump was a ""bigot"" and a ""white supremacist."" ESPN issued a statement saying the tweets were ""inappropriate.""

If you knew SC6 only through Hill's critics, you might think the show is Rachel Maddow meets The Source. In fact, like a lot of ESPN hosts, Hill's Twitter feed and her TV show exist on separate planes. On SC6, Hill and Smith rarely plan an explicitly political segment unless an athlete like Colin Kaepernick or Michael Bennett demands that they do. And while Hill may not be a Trump fan, her opinion-slinging has never been predictable. In May, she defended LaVar Ball from accusations of sexism when she could have gotten a mother lode of retweets by saying the opposite.

The effect that Trump's election had on Hill and Smith is perhaps best described like this: It made two black hosts into actors in a national psychodrama before they uttered a word. And it made it inevitable that when Hill said exactly what was on her mind, her critics would hold that up as proof of what they thought about Hill all along.

""This election was about taking the country back from people like us, right?"" Smith said. ""And now, it's like, 'Dammit, I got to come home and watch these two?!'""

""That may not be what you want on SportsCenter,"" he added. ""OK. That's fair. Watch Fox.""

When Hill and Smith leave the terrarium of social media, they're amazed to find that a lot of people really like them. At this year's NBA All-Star Weekend, Hill and her boyfriend  --  a Michigan State alum whose identity she asked me to protect  --  were walking down Bourbon Street in New Orleans. The rapper Cam'ron was standing on a balcony above them. Cam'ron flashed six fingers, a nod to SC6, and invited them up. Cam'ron asked Hill when she and Smith were going to do a parody of Paid in Full.

Barack Obama is a Hill super-fan. In 2015, when Hill and her boyfriend arrived at the White House's holiday media party, Obama exclaimed, ""Finally, someone I know!"" He and Hill fell into such a deep conversation that Hill's boyfriend wondered if she was flirting with the president. Kobe Bryant, whom Hill once lambasted for his comments about Trayvon Martin, now calls her ""Sports Oprah.""

If someone in a liquor store asks Hill for a picture and then finds their phone isn't working, Hill will offer to text them a photo from her own phone  --  until Kelley L. Carter reminds her that she's now too big to be giving out her private number to strangers. ""She doesn't know that she's Jemele Hill,"" Carter told me, ""and I don't know if she ever will.""

In June, as the social media din threatened to become SC6's defining feature, John Skipper called Hill and Smith into his office for a pep talk. ""John Skipper has been very, very supportive,"" Hill said over dinner in Hartford. ""But I'd be lying if I didn't say that in the back of mind, I'm like, 'Are they thinking maybe this was a bad idea?' Because I don't know what our grace period or honeymoon looks like.""

""Mike and I know who we are,"" Hill added. ""We know who we'd like to be on TV. But figuring out who we'd like to be in this space is our ultimate, continual challenge.""

It's also ESPN's challenge. Like plenty of old-media institutions, the Worldwide Leader has seen the allure of its signature franchises dim and its hosts' every utterance scrutinized for political bias. But when you try to fulfill a nebulous expectation of what you ought to be, when you worry about offending people in a period in which everyone is aching to be offended, you risk a rerun of last month's Robert Lee fiasco.

ESPN has problems that won't be solved by only what it puts on television. But in terms of daily schedule, it has one solution: for its hosts to say what they want, to be themselves  --  to let the lambos out, as Mike Greenberg might put it. ""The best revenge is success,"" Jemele Hill said, as she sipped a glass of pinot noir. ""That's all we got."""
26,26,"A view of the Steve Jobs Theatre at Apple Park in Cupertino, California. (AFP)

Apple's new spaceship headquarters peeked above a nearby hillside as the sun shined gloriously through towering glass walls of the entryway to Steve Jobs Theater. The smell of freshly turned soil was heavy in the warming air even as the site was inaugurated with the unveiling of a 10th anniversary iPhone at Apple Park in Silicon Valley.

""Apple Park has been built to reflect Apple's values for technology and the environment,"" chief executive Tim Cook said after paying tribute to late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs at the first-ever media event at the new campus Tuesday. ""The park itself was converted from a sea of asphalt to a green space with more than 9,000 trees; designed to be transparent with nature and bring the outside in.""

Glass walls give the feeling of remaining in nature even after stepping inside. Plants and trees taking root throughout the grand campus are native to California, and drought-resistant. All the electricity needed to run the campus comes from an on-site solar power system, one of the largest in the world.

Steve's 'baby'

Light streams down onto a curved stairway made of gold-toned stone leading down to Steve Jobs Theater built into the hill. ""Steve Jobs was an incredibly detail-oriented person, and this was his baby,"" said Creative Strategies analyst and Silicon Valley veteran Tim Bajarin. ""This should be a crown jewel in the sense of design.""

Apple Park was created with ""extraordinary attention to detail and materials,"" according to Cook. A visitors centre that will open to the public later this year features an augmented reality experience to virtually explore the campus.

About six months ago, workers began boarding the futuristic new campus, fulfilling a vision set out by Jobs, the company's late founder. The process of moving more than 12,000 people to a new campus that Jobs envisioned as a ""center for creativity and collaboration"" was expected to continue late into the year.

A theater on the new Apple Park campus was named in honour of Jobs, who died six years ago after a battle with pancreatic cancer. ""Steve's vision for Apple stretched far beyond his time with us,"" Cook said in a release earlier this year. ""He intended Apple Park to be the home of innovation for generations to come.""

Staggering

The 175-acre (70-hectare) campus with a ring-shaped main building clad in giant panels of curved glass blends workspaces and parkland. ""I was amazed at the landscape,"" Bajarin said after leaving Apple Park. ""It was staggering how huge the campus is.""

The ring design is aimed at fostering better collaboration among those working inside. ""It is a unique design; very different that what you think of with a Silicon Valley campus,"" analyst Bajarin said. ""We are used to campuses where there are multistory buildings close together -- Apple broke with convention.""

Campus features include a fitness center, foot paths, research labs and an orchard. ""We have approached the design, engineering and making of our new campus with the same enthusiasm and design principles that characterize our products,"" Apple chief design officer Jony Ive said in a statement.

Apple celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. The Silicon Valley legend sprang out of Jobs's garage to reshape modern life with trend-setting gadgets.

Jobs, a tech-savvy marketing genius, and Steve Wozniak, who invented the Apple computer, formed what would become the world's largest corporation with eye-popping annual profits. The two college dropouts created the company that has changed the way people use computers, listen to music, communicate on the go, and made people at home in a world of ""apps"" tailored for work, play, education, health and more.

Apple's hit products command a cult-like following, long after the company's humble beginning in Jobs's Cupertino, California garage on April 1, 1976. The new campus is in Cupertino as well, with the Jobs Theater on a hilltop overlooking meadows and the main building. ""Steve (Jobs) was exhilarated, and inspired, by the California landscape, by its light and its expansiveness,"" his widow Laurene Powell Jobs said. ""It was his favourite setting for thought. Apple Park captures his spirit uncannily well.""

Cook began the first-ever media event in the theater with a tribute to Steve Jobs, whose image and words were shared with the audience. ""I love gearing his voice, and his inspiring message,"" Cook said. ""We dedicated this theater to Steve because we loved him and because he loved days like this."" Cook hosted an event at which Apple laid claim to the future of the smartphone with a 10th anniversary iPhone X, featuring facial recognition unlocking, augmented reality capabilities and other refinements the star of the presentation."

A visitors center that will open to the public later this year features an augmented reality experience to virtually explore the campus.

About six months ago, workers began boarding the futuristic new campus, fulfilling a vision set out by Jobs, the company's late founder.

The process of moving more than 12,000 people to a new campus that Jobs envisioned as a ""center for creativity and collaboration"" was expected to continue late into the year.

A theater on the new Apple Park campus was named in honor of Jobs, who died six years ago after a battle with pancreatic cancer.

34,34,"Jeremy Hunt predicts patients will be diagnosed by machines by the time the NHS is 80 in 2028

COMPUTERS will replace doctors in little over a decade, the health secretary says.

Jeremy Hunt predicts patients will be diagnosed by machines by the time the NHS has its 80th birthday - in 2028.

Technology is advancing at such a speed it will tell people they are ill before they have any symptoms - and feeling sick will be seen as a ""failure"".

Mr Hunt told a conference in Manchester: ""The changes in medical innovation are likely to transform humanity by as much in the next 25 years as the internet has in the last 25 years.

""So, what might medicine look like when the NHS is 80? Well the first thing is we may well not be going to doctors for a diagnosis. We might be going to computers instead.

""We will be in a world where if we show any symptoms of a disease we consider that a sign of failure.

""Because the name of the game will be to catch diseases when we are asymptomatic and we have a much better chance of being able to nip illness in the bud.""

Machines are already being developed to assess x-rays and detect cancer or abnormalities in tissue, with some more accurate than medics.

Diagnostic computers will look at 300,000 indicators within a blood sample and compare them with existing data on other patients to generate a personalised treatment plan.

Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, said the health service will be investing more in artificial intelligence over the next year.

He said: ""We have great opportunity to get smarter about the way we are using AI and machine learning to improve the quality of clinical care.""

And Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, said: ""When you think of mobile technology that's one thing but when you think of coupling it with AI it takes us into a whole new arena.

""We know from a number of studies that have been done that in certain circumstances AI is better than doctors at diagnosing certain conditions.

""It's possible that certain types - and there are many different types of AI - will be able to read x-rays.

""I've been told by people who are developing this sort of stuff that's within a four year time frame.

We also know that this kind of approach can be used for reading histopathology slides.

""All of this takes us into very new territory and it's not a long way over there, it's actually here now.

""So we as a society, as people intimately involved with the NHS, we really need to think about the implications of that."""
35,35,"NHS patients could one day be diagnosed by computers instead of doctors, health leaders have said.

In a decade's time, patients may even be diagnosed with conditions before they are symptomatic as full genome sequencing becomes accessible to the masses, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said.

Meanwhile, NHS England bosses described how artificial intelligence could help with diagnostics including x-rays and potential cancer specimens.

Speaking at the NHS Expo conference in Manchester, Mr Hunt said: ""The changes in medical innovation are likely to transform humanity by as much in the next 25 years as the internet has in the last 25 years.

""So what might medicine look like when the NHS is 80 [in 2028]? Well, the first thing is we may well not be going to doctors for a diagnosis, we might be going to computers instead, who will be looking at the 300,000 biomarkers in every single drop of blood, mashing that with big data information about everyone else's biomarkers.

""And when we do go to a doctor, he or she may will be comparing your medical record with our fully sequenced genome and giving us much more accurate predictive information.

""We may will be in a world where if we show any symptoms of a disease, we consider that a sign of failure - because the name of the game will be to catch diseases when we are asymptomatic and we have a much better chance of being able to nip illness in the bud.""

He also said that he wants patients to be able to view their GP interactions on an app ""as simply as you can look at your entire order history on Amazon.""

""We are very keen to boost the number of organs that are available for transplant and we think this is a very easy way to do that and gives us the opportunity to prompt people to express a preference actively through technology that they might not otherwise do.

""And this is going to take a bit longer to get right but this also gives us the opportunity for people to express their end-of-life preferences online and in particular that crucial piece of information as to whether people would prefer to die at home or in a hospital setting. If we can get that information early enough and get it agreed early enough then it means we can give a much better end-of-life experience."""

In a decade's time, patients may even be diagnosed with conditions before they are symptomatic as full genome sequencing becomes accessible to the masses, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said.

In the nearer future, patients will be able to make their wishes about organ donation and end-of-life care known through simple apps, he said.

Meanwhile, NHS England bosses described how artificial intelligence could help with diagnostics including x-rays and potential cancer specimens.

Speaking at the NHS Expo conference in Manchester, Mr Hunt said: ""The changes in medical innovation are likely to transform humanity by as much in the next 25 years as the internet has in the last 25 years.

""So what might medicine look like when the NHS is 80 [in 2028]? Well, the first thing is we may well not be going to doctors for a diagnosis, we might be going to computers instead, who will be looking at the 300,000 biomarkers in every single drop of blood, mashing that with big data information about everyone else's biomarkers.

""And when we do go to a doctor, he or she may will be comparing your medical record with our fully sequenced genome and giving us much more accurate predictive information.

""We may will be in a world where if we show any symptoms of a disease, we consider that a sign of failure - because the name of the game will be to catch diseases when we are asymptomatic and we have a much better chance of being able to nip illness in the bud.""

He also said that he wants patients to be able to view their GP interactions on an app ""as simply as you can look at your entire order history on Amazon.""

Patients should also be able to change their preferences for end-of-life care and organ donation through apps, he said.

""In organ donation where there is a big debate about opt-out and opt-in, we think that it should be as easy as loading up an app on your smartphone to change your preferences,"" he added.

Patients should also be able to change their preferences for end-of-life care and organ donation through apps, he said.

""In organ donation where there is a big debate about opt-out and opt-in, we think that it should be as easy as loading up an app on your smartphone to change your preferences,"" he added.

""We are very keen to boost the number of organs that are available for transplant and we think this is a very easy way to do that and gives us the opportunity to prompt people to express a preference actively through technology that they might not otherwise do.

63,63,"Computers could start diagnosing patients' illnesses within the next few years as artificial intelligence increasingly ousts doctors from their traditional roles, NHS leaders believe.

Machines may soon be able to read X-rays and analyse samples of diseased tissue, such as lumps that can indicate the presence of breast cancer, the NHS's top doctor said.

NHS England plans to invest more of its £120bn budget in AI to speed up its application to medicine and the health service, especially the task of analysing ""huge swaths"" of the information collected from patients about their symptoms.

""We know from a number of studies that have been done that in, certain circumstances, AI is better than doctors at diagnosing certain conditions,"" said Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the organisation's national medical director.

""It's possible that certain types - and there are many different types of AI - will be able to read X-rays. I've been told by people who are developing this sort of stuff that's within a four-year timeframe. We also know that this kind of approach can be used for reading histopathology slides.

""All of this takes us into very new territory and it's not a long way over there, it's actually here now,"" he told delegates at NHS England's Health and Care Innovation Expo in Manchester.

Histopathology involves the examination of breast lumps or specimens of someone's bowel, removed because they have suspected cancer.

Simon Stevens, NHS chief executive, quoted a recent Lancet editorial on how greater use of AI could lead to ""big shifts"" in radiology and pathology from doctors to machines.

""We have a great opportunity to get smarter about the way we are using AI and machine learning with datasets to improve the quality of clinical care,"" he said.

""The Lancet pointed out that over the course of a career a radiologist would probably read over 10m images, a dermatologist might analyse over 200,000 skin lesions and a pathologist will review nearly 100,000 specimens - whereas there is great potential to actually automate huge swathes of what is actually happening in radiology and to some extent pathology and dermatology,"" Stevens added.

There is emerging evidence from around the world that machines can help identify patients who have autism or Alzheimer's disease.

Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, said computers could be routinely diagnosing health conditions - even before they display symptoms - by the time the NHS turns 80 in 2028.

""The changes in medical innovation are likely to transform humanity by as much in the next 25 years as the internet has in the last 25 years,"" he told the 5,000 delegates.

""So what might medicine look like when the NHS is 80?

The revolution in genomics is central to easier, potentially more accurate diagnosis, Hunt added. ""When we do go to a doctor, he or she may be comparing your medical record with our fully sequenced genome and giving us much more accurate predictive information.

64,64,"Apple CEO Tim Cook unveils the iPhone X at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, Sept. 12, 2017. (Getty Images)

Tuesday is a big day for fans of Apple's iPhone: The company announced a slick new iPhone, called the iPhone X, with features including a bigger screen, thinner edges, and facial recognition for security.

It will be the most upscale iPhone yet and starts at $999. That makes the new super-luxury iPhone the same price as Apple's basic laptop, the MacBook Air. The company also announced two other iPhones and new versions of its watch and TV media player.

Although Tuesday's announcements will create a lot of hoopla among enthusiasts of consumer electronics, it is also a pivotal day for the company itself. Apple -- the third-largest company in the United States and the most valuable company in the world -- has seen its stock price surge a remarkable 53 percent in the last year.

But last year, for the first time in 15 years, Apple's sales dropped. Okay, sure, the company still made $46 billion in profit, on sales of $216 billion -- which is a number greater than the gross domestic product of three-quarters of the world's countries.

Yet some analysts have started to wonder how much longer Apple's dominance can continue. Under founder Steve Jobs, the company either created or dramatically expanded markets for gadgets that people didn't yet know they wanted or needed: personal computers (Apple II, 1977; Macintosh, 1984), music players (iPod, 2001), smartphones (iPhone, 2007), and tablets (iPad, 2010). Its inventions have largely reshaped how we listen to music, consume news, and communicate with each other.

Jobs' philosophy on innovation, as quoted in the outstanding 2011 Walter Isaacson biography Steve Jobs, was

Some people say, ""Give the customers what they want."" But that's not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, ""If I'd asked consumers what they wanted, they would have told me, 'A faster horse!'"" People don't know what they want until you show it to them.

Isaacson called Jobs a ""genius"" whose ""imaginative leaps were instinctive, unexpected, and at times magical. . . . He made products that were completely innovative, combining the power of poetry and processors.""

Since CEO Tim Cook took over after Jobs died of cancer in 2011, the company has refined products such as Apple TV and launched the Apple Watch. It is moving into areas such as artificial intelligence and perhaps even self-driving cars, as are its competitors. Yet while sales of new products are increasing, Apple still relies to an enormous extent on the iPhone: Almost two-thirds of Apple's revenue comes from iPhone sales. And that proportion has generally been rising over the last decade.

All of which makes Tuesday's launch of the iPhone X and the iPhone 8 even more crucial. As analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research told Wired: ""Tuesday, September 12, is going to be the biggest day for Apple in at least three years."" The risk is that the new phone will be ""disappointing to consumers in some way,"" Dawson said.

Expect big lines at Apple stores in the next few weeks as the new products become available. But it will take much longer than that to figure out if the enthusiasm is enough to keep Apple on top."
65,65,"Boosting his spirits have been the ""hundreds of letters"" he says he's received, most of which are supportive. Then he allows: ""I occasionally get a bad one."" He tells me about a letter from a woman from Champaign. She had been working in state government in 2003 when, on Blagojevich's first full day as governor, he fired dozens of his predecessor's political appointees, including her. ""She basically waits about 13 years to write me, and I'm in this deep, dark valley, and she says, 'I hope you're somebody's you-know-what' in prison jargon. It was kind of funny.""

Over the years, FCI Englewood has housed its fair share of high-profile inmates. In the mid-1990s, when the facility was medium-security, Oklahoma City bombers Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were held there during their trials in Denver. Blagojevich has overlapped with several notorious offenders. Among them: Jeffrey Sterling, the former CIA officer who was convicted in 2015 of leaking classified information about Iran's nuclear program to The New York Times; Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's disgraced CEO; Rafael Cárdenas-Vela, an ex-leader of the Mexican drug-trafficking Gulf Cartel; and Jared Fogle, the former Subway pitchman convicted of distributing child pornography and having sex with minors.

For a while, Blagojevich wasn't even the highest-level government official at FCI Englewood. Alfonso Portillo, the former president of Guatemala who pleaded guilty to laundering $2.5 million in bribes from Taiwan, spent time there before being released in 2015. Also at FCI Englewood for a spell: Mike Carona, the former sheriff of Orange County, California, who was convicted of ordering witnesses to lie during a corruption probe.

""When I first came to prison, there was a notoriety to me,"" Blagojevich says. His soon-to-be fellow inmates watched his arrival live on CNN. In the cash-free economy of prison, Blagojevich's celebrity was currency. During his first few weeks, his ID card kept getting stolen. ""They thought they could sell 'em for something,"" Blagojevich says. One day, he went to work out at the gym. He put his ID in his shoe but accidentally dropped it. A prisoner nicknamed Grinch found it and kept it, he says. ""Grinch was part of a group of other inmates who worked at the hobby craft. They built this small piece of furniture that looked like a dresser, and they put a false floor on the bottom of the drawer and put my ID card in it so they could mail it out of the prison, 'cause [prison authorities] check all your mail."" Another inmate who was in the group but friendly with Blagojevich foiled the plan.

That didn't stop others from trying to capitalize. In April 2015, the National Enquirer published several photos of Blagojevich taken by an inmate using a smuggled cell phone. The first pictures of him in FCI Englewood to surface, the fuzzy images call to mind Bigfoot sightings. In one, a bespectacled Blagojevich, with, as the Enquirer described it, ""dazzling snow white"" hair and dressed in a prison-issued khaki T-shirt and sweatpants with a large rip at the knee, is engrossed in a book, his chin resting on his fist and his legs up on a desk. In the other photos, he's in track shorts and a sleeveless tee, relaxing on a bench in the sun.

Blagojevich served his initial 32 months at the low-security facility -- the first 18 of them in the dorm-style room with the general prison population, until he moved into what he calls FCI Englewood's ""high-rent district,"" with its two-man units the size of office cubicles. That upgrade came courtesy of an inmate Blagojevich had befriended; when the prisoner's cellmate left FCI Englewood, he invited the ex-governor to move in. The room had a metal bunk bed and a single small window that offered a slivered glimpse of the sky and little else. ""My home was a six-foot-by-12-foot prison cell, four cement walls, and a big, heavy iron door that shuts you in,"" Blagojevich says.

His living situation improved greatly when he was moved to the adjoining minimum-security camp -- or ""outside the fence,"" as the prisoners refer to the site because it has no outer barriers. Inmates with less than 10 years on their sentences and who are considered low risk for escape are eligible. ""It's night and day between 'inside the fence' and 'outside the fence,' "" Blagojevich says. ""I treat this more like a training camp, actually."" He adds with a laugh: ""I'm working my way back up, you know, from a deep, deep valley to a less deep valley.""

Converted from a motel that served those visiting FCI Englewood prisoners, the camp is a boomerang-shaped building with about 50 rooms. Those rooms, which sleep five, are carpeted and have bathrooms with tubs, which Blagojevich likes to use after long runs. Inmates are given much more freedom, and there is only one guard on duty each shift. ""There's lots of room for shenanigans,"" says one of Blagojevich's former cellmates, who asked not to be named. At night, after the final count, inmates have been known to venture off to Walmart to buy cigarettes. Some have even headed out to the golf course for trysts with girlfriends.

The looser vibe took Patti by surprise initially. She recalls the first time she and her daughters visited her husband at the camp. As they were driving off, they noticed Blagojevich by the side of the road, waving to them. ""I was like, 'Oh my God, this is the first time I've seen you outside in years,' "" Patti recalls. ""I just wanted to say, 'Jump in the car -- let's go home!' ""

For Blagojevich, a man who rose to political heights from modest roots (he is the son of a Serbian-born steelworker and a CTA ticket clerk), prison has been a humbling experience, full of little indignities. As at most correctional facilities, inmates are assigned menial jobs, such as washing dishes, mopping floors, and scrubbing toilets. At the low-security facility, Blagojevich did a three-month stint in the kitchen, one of the toughest tasks, but primarily worked in the law library and taught classes on the Civil War and World War II. His current job as an orderly at the camp pays $8.40 a month. ""My jurisdiction was once all of the State of Illinois. Now I've got two hallways to clean,"" he says. ""I feel like I was a very good governor, and now I feel like I'm doing a pretty good job on those floors."" He recalls that his first job, at age 9, was as a shoeshine boy. ""I was making more money then than I'm making as a 60-year-old former governor with a college degree and a law degree.""

In one of our phone calls, Blagojevich tells me how a correctional officer had chewed him out a few days earlier in the prison gym: ""I was wearing a cutoff T-shirt, you know, like one of those muscle shirts, and he yelled at me, 'You can't wear that! Get out of here!' And I said, 'I'm in the gym.' He said, 'Get out of here!' And I just walked away, but I muttered to myself, 'Boy, if I ever get that power back ...' Then I caught myself, and I was like, 'No, there's no lesson in that. The guy's doing his job.' ""

There have been heartbreaking moments, such as during last year's World Series. Blagojevich is a die-hard Cubs fan, and the team had long been something he and his older daughter, Amy, bonded over. So Patti bought Amy a ticket to Denver so she could watch game 3 with her dad. One problem: The correctional officer in charge that month of the camp's cafeteria -- which doubles as the visiting area -- had a no-TV policy. Recalls Patti: ""Rod even went to him -- because I had already bought the ticket -- and asked him, you know, 'My daughter bought a ticket, she wants to watch the game with me.' Nope! Not gonna turn the TV on."" Amy wound up staying home.

Blagojevich has come to savor the small acts of kindness. On his first day, he tells me, a group of inmates presented him with the big-house version of a welcome basket. ""They took up a collection and put together a gift bag and gave me a whole bunch of different stuff that I would need before I had a chance to go to the commissary."" Among the items were coffee, a couple of plastic mugs, and a toothbrush. ""It was really kind of touching. You know, these are big, tough guys, drug dealers and gangbangers and bank robbers -- they have so little, right? -- and it's kind of a sweet thing that they did, welcoming you to their world.""

When Blagojevich talks about prison life, he tends to speak in the second person -- ""you"" instead of ""I"" -- as if he's disassociating himself from his unpleasant reality. Which calls to mind his last public interview, in 2012, right before he was due to surrender to FCI Englewood authorities. Speaking in a restaurant in Littleton, he admitted he had been struggling to come to terms even with the word ""prison."" ""I think of it like a military base,"" he told NBC-5's Phil Rogers. ""Like I'm reporting for military service. That's a little game I play with myself.""

For mental and emotional fortitude behind bars, he has turned to religion. ""I've had a chance in prison over these many years to get closer, stronger in my faith,"" says Blagojevich, once an altar boy at his Serbian Orthodox church. ""The lessons from the Bible and scripture have been very helpful to me. It's strengthened my strength. It's also strengthened my resolve. It's convinced me further that I know what I'm doing is right. Among the lessons is, you've gotta put faith over fear, you gotta be willing to go through fire when you believe in something. I've come to see the object of life is to do God's will. So I'm putting my trust in God and whatever his plan is for me.""

In prison, nearly everyone has a nickname. ""In my housing unit alone,"" Blagojevich says, ""there was Smelly, Socks, Sharkey, V, Mr. B, and Boo."" Blagojevich's nickname? Gov, naturally.

Nonetheless, he hardly runs the joint. Once a gifted glad-hander as a politician, Blagojevich is largely a loner as an inmate. ""You gotta navigate carefully, you gotta deal with the politics of prison, and you gotta be careful with that,"" he says, explaining why he mostly keeps to himself. ""There are all kinds of reasons why, I think, it's necessary. But it's mostly, I think, emotional self-protection, just keeping me focused on what, I think, my purpose is."" That purpose being his own development as a person: ""When I deviate from that, I find myself not as strong as I want to be.""

Blagojevich's former cellmate tells me that at the low-security facility there was a group of white-collar offenders, the cellmate included, who would meet every Friday after lunch to talk about world events. They called themselves the White-Collar Roundtable. ""We would have real deep discussions about business and politics and world financial markets, things you don't get in prison -- intellectual conversation,"" he explains. But Blagojevich rarely took part. ""He was usually walking the track at that time. He'd stop by, but he didn't want to be engaged. He just didn't want to participate. He's fairly independent.""

Yet Blagojevich has made several close friends. At the low-security facility, one buddy was Beverly Hills real estate developer Charles Elliott Fitzgerald, whom the Los Angeles Times called the ""architect of one of the largest real estate frauds in California history."" But Fitzgerald, who is serving 14 years for bilking mortgage lenders out of more than $40 million, has since been transferred to another prison. There have been other inmates Blagojevich befriended who have since been released. Says Patti: ""What's so frustrating to him is that people leave and he's stuck there. So it's hard to make friends because everybody's got a shorter sentence.""

Patti tells me that while her husband has gotten close to some white-collar offenders, he'd rather socialize with other inmates. ""He far prefers the honest drug dealer to the con-artist guys.""

I ask Blagojevich about that. ""You gotta promise me,"" he playfully implores, ""you're not going to throw on the headline 'Blago Likes Drug Dealers.' "" He continues: ""I find myself naturally gravitating more to those guys. They come from rougher backgrounds. They didn't really have much opportunity. I've found myself very sympathetic to them. There's more of an affinity toward them. I've learned that there are a lot of criminals here that have good hearts. Some of these white-collar guys, boy, they tell tall tales. There are lots of victims that have been tremendously hurt and harmed by what they've done. Their sentences are less than guys who were wrong to deal in drugs but were like the bootleggers of my mother's generation.""

I ask if he's lonely.

""Well, of course, yeah,"" he replies softly. ""Years of loneliness and affliction, yearning for home, missing my family. But I'm OK.""

More than a week later, I receive a lengthy follow-up email from Blagojevich. He wants to elaborate. ""The reason I feel this question needs a fuller answer,"" he explains, ""is that the separation from your family and the loneliness that ensues is central to the challenge of enduring prison, of 'doing time.' As anyone could probably appreciate, in prison, while you are almost always surrounded by other people and are rarely if ever alone -- you are alone. All alone, except for the loneliness that never leaves you alone. It is always with you; a constant companion.""

In the email he talks about a recurring dream he had when he first got to FCI Englewood: ""In the dream I was not in prison but I would be in court or in a place that represented the federal court building. That place would appear differently in each of the dreams. I dreamed I was facing criminal charges and the threat of prison. ... But as that nightmare I was witnessing in my sleep was unfolding, I would invariably find comfort in telling myself something like, 'Don't worry, this isn't real. It is only a dream. It won't be long and soon I'll wake up and can put this bad dream behind me.' Have you ever had dreams like this where you tell yourself within the dream that you are only dreaming?""

He goes on: ""The loneliness is still there today. But it's different. The sharpness of the pain that was so intense at the beginning -- where sometimes you felt you would never feel anything but that pain -- has with the passing of all these years, slowly and imperceptibly aged into a sadness that has found a home inside of me. It is beneath the surface and not as intense, but it's always with me. At the smallest prompting it can be activated. Where a moment before you might be laughing at a funny story, suddenly something happens or a thought crosses your mind and -- boom! -- the reality hits you. Real life intrudes.""

Like most prisons, FCI Englewood is a collection of isolated societies. ""The segregation of the races and other ethnic groups is not only allowed, it's encouraged,"" Blagojevich says. Take the low-security facility's cafeteria. The black inmates sit together. Hispanics dine in another area. White-collar prisoners have their own corner. Sex offenders are shunned by nearly everyone. ""All the groups have tables of their own, and no one else from another group is allowed,"" Blagojevich says.

Within his first few days, Blagojevich was summoned to the guard captain's office for a lesson on the ins and outs of prison-yard politics. The captain and a couple of other correctional officers had found out that he'd walked the track with a black inmate. ""They felt I should be made aware of the usual way things were done,"" Blagojevich says. They suggested that for his protection he ""ride"" with a couple of other inmates in a ""car"" (prison slang for traveling in a clique). ""The purpose is to have people who will stand behind you, should you find yourself facing a physical threat."" One of the inmates the officers recommended, Blagojevich soon discovered, was the ""shot caller"" of the prison's white contingency. ""Initially, to be respectful to the officers, and on their recommendation, I sought those guys out. It was then that I realized they were white supremacists and politely declined their offer of protection.""

Blagojevich tells me about one inmate he befriended at the low-security facility: Mr. B, a drug dealer from Chicago's West Side. Tall, thin, and black, with white hair, a white mustache, and a fatherly way about him, Mr. B reminded Blagojevich of Morgan Freeman. The inmate, who was in his late 60s, was on the last leg of a 20-year sentence when the two men became close. At night, before lights out, Blagojevich would stop by Mr. B's bunk, a few down from his. They'd talk about all kinds of things: about growing up in Chicago, about racial tensions, about the time in 1966 when Martin Luther King Jr. took up residence in North Lawndale to protest the city's discriminatory housing practices.

One night, the two hatched a plan ""in the spirit of Dr. King and his efforts to end segregation,"" says Blagojevich. As a modest challenge to FCI Englewood's racial division, Blagojevich sat with Mr. B for lunch at one of the tables designated for blacks. ""At first, heads turned,"" Blagojevich says. ""And then -- nothing. It turned out to be no big deal. No one really cared. No one complained. The days came and went, and I would sit with Mr. B every day at lunch."" They alternated between the black and white sides of the cafeteria. ""We were mini civil rights activists with neither a following or a cause anyone cared about.""

While governor, Blagojevich was notoriously fanatical about following his own press. His staff would clip every story that mentioned him, and he would get irate if they missed one. These days, though, Blagojevich doesn't much follow politics -- or the news in general. ""I know about the murder rate in Chicago,"" he says. ""I'm well aware of that. The TVs here in the common area, they're always on. You can't hear unless you put headphones on, but you can see the scrolling of CNN or Fox News, and when I see things about Chicago, I'll stop and look."" He has no access to the internet. (His emails, which can go only to recipients approved by the facility, are sent through the prison's dedicated electronic messaging system and monitored by authorities.)

He regained some interest in politics during last year's presidential race. The 2012 campaign was another story. That October, seven months after Blagojevich arrived at FCI Englewood, the first presidential debate was held at the University of Denver, just 10 miles away. ""I couldn't watch,"" he explains. ""It was too painful, too close to home."" So he found a way to keep himself occupied. An inmate named Ernie, a professional musician who had gotten busted for smuggling drugs from Mexico, had been teaching Blagojevich to play the guitar. But the prison's band room was closed that night, so they landed another spot to practice where the acoustics were good.

Here's how Blagojevich tells it: ""While Obama and Romney are debating, maybe 20 minutes from where I am, I'm in the men's room."" The contrast was so startling it was comical, he says. ""There I was in the men's room -- in prison -- and the guy that I knew and was a contemporary of in politics -- I was the first governor to endorse Obama for president -- he's getting ready for his second term. And when Obama got done with that debate, he was able to get on Air Force One and fly home and sleep that night in his bed in the White House. I had to go back in my bunk and spend the night in the shithouse. It was almost more amusing to me than devastating.""

As for his guitar playing, Ernie thought Blagojevich would make a better frontman. He invited the ex-governor to join his band, the Jailhouse Rockers, on vocals. Blagojevich practiced every day. ""Believe it or not, you can actually improve your singing,"" he says. ""My two-bit cheap Elvis impersonation is less two-bit and less cheap."" The band played Elvis and Sinatra classics, as well as the blues. Their biggest gig -- Blagojevich's former cellmate remembers it as their only gig -- was performing at the prison's GED graduation ceremony in July 2013. Blagojevich recalls: ""We worked five hours a day on this for months. We did six songs. The best one was the Elvis medley: all of 'Don't Be Cruel,' two verses of 'That's All Right,' two verses of 'All Shook Up,' and all of 'Jailhouse Rock.' ""

Blagojevich largely avoids the TV rooms, where convicts like to gather. Particularly at the low-security facility, they can be tinderboxes for fights -- ""so you gotta navigate carefully,"" he says. ""I think, in the five and a half years I've been here, I've watched maybe five movies. The Lincoln movie by Steven Spielberg, twice. I stumbled into the movie Ghost recently. It's a nice movie, and I sat and watched it. I watch football -- if the Bears play or the Dallas Cowboys play. They show the Cowboys here a lot. Of course, the Super Bowl -- I try to watch that. And when the Cubs are on."" Recalls his former cellmate: ""If the Dallas Cowboys were on, Rod would have a chair, front and center.""

The most productive way to spend his time, he's found, is self-improvement. ""I spend virtually every day working on things that are constructive,"" he says. ""It makes the passing of time a lot better. If you just wallow around and wander with no purpose, that would be almost impossible to deal with.""

Much of his day is devoted to reading, writing, and exercising. He cracks open the Bible daily. ""It's the first thing I do in the morning,"" he says. ""Read it. Reread it. Understand it better."" During our conversation in May, he tells me he is absorbed in Stephen Ambrose's Undaunted Courage, about Lewis and Clark's exploration of the Louisiana Territory, as well as Strength to Love, a collection of Martin Luther King Jr.'s sermons. He has also found solace in the Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl's seminal Man's Search for Meaning, in which the author finds purpose in suffering. ""I've read that book three times,"" he says. ""Inspired by it, I began to develop ideas about what I could do in the difficult circumstances I found myself in that could help me direct my energies and efforts to use the time I had to pass in prison working toward a worthy goal. Something more than just marking time and getting through the years ahead. Viktor Frankl explained it by writing if you had a 'why' to live, you can find the 'how.' ""

Most nights, Blagojevich reads until 2 or 3 o'clock, using a tiny book light he bought at the commissary. He calls the time his ""Winston Churchill hours,"" because Churchill did some of his best writing in the wee hours of the morning.

On and off for the past few years, Blagojevich has been doing some writing of his own: a series of inspirational essays. He describes them as stories about ""different people who have faced crushing adversity and, in their own way, turned their adversity into positive achievement."" His subjects range from FDR to South Side gospel composer Thomas Dorsey, who wrote the classic ""Take My Hand, Precious Lord"" while grieving the deaths of his wife and infant son, and Terry Fox, the Canadian runner who lost a leg to cancer but ran halfway across that country in 1980 to raise money and awareness for cancer research. ""I have written something like 12 to 15 incomplete essays so far,"" says Blagojevich. ""It gives me something to work on. It helps focus my thinking and puts into perspective what my family and I have had to go through.""

For Blagojevich, a longtime avid runner (recall that he was arrested and appeared in court in a blue jogging suit), exercise has taken on a new significance. ""[It] has been extremely important to me, less so physically than it is mentally and emotionally. It clears your head. It gives you goals to have to work on."" His former cellmate says: ""He's always exercising. If he's not lifting weights or running, he's walking. He's really superfit. He's, like, ripped.""

Finding the right running shoes, however, has been a challenge. Almost no personal property is allowed, so Blagojevich could not bring in his preferred brand. Selection in the commissary, not surprisingly, is limited. He tried a couple of pairs until he found one he could tolerate. But when those shoes started to fall apart, he discovered the commissary had stopped stocking them. Blagojevich went around the prison looking for other inmates who had the shoes he liked in his size. He finally located someone and traded new shoes for the used pair.

But even his workouts aren't immune from stress. Blagojevich tells me about a time he was lifting weights in the gym of the low-security facility. As he was bench-pressing, a group of ""big muscle guys"" stared him down. ""I get done doing a set, and they're looking at me. I didn't know what to say. So I said, 'I'll never have arms as big as former governor Schwarzenegger's, but I do believe my arms are finally bigger than former governor Palin's.' "" Whatever tension there was, his quip seemed to defuse it.

It's not just his body he's focused on improving. ""I'm also working on my Spanish,"" Blagojevich points out. Two of his current roommates, both from Mexico, serve as his tutors. ""I did [campaign] commercials in Spanish. But now I feel like I'm a lot more conversive in it. I can say all kinds of things.""

Like what?

He thinks for a moment before rattling off a stream of Spanish.

Then he translates for me: ""When the truth is on your side, you have to stand up and fight for it.""

The first time I meet up with Patti Blagojevich is at Oromo Cafe, a small coffee shop in Lincoln Square. Nobody seems to recognize her. Maybe it's because her trademark bangs, which she wore as the state's first lady, are now gone, her brown hair falling to her shoulders. Or perhaps it's because she tends to shun the spotlight these days -- only stepping back into it when she shows up at the federal courthouse for her husband's hearings.

Now 52, she looks strained and tired, and her eyes are weary and sad. If you know her only as the daughter of the rough-and-tumble old-school ward boss Dick Mell or from her expletive-filled cameo on the wiretaps -- egging on her husband to ""hold up that fucking Cubs shit, fuck them,"" referring to the alleged plot to obstruct the sale of Wrigley Field -- you may be surprised that she is remarkably unassuming and, unlike her husband, reluctant to talk to reporters.

""Barbara Walters called me Foul Mouth Lady Macbeth, or something like that,"" she says, a memory still fresh and painful. ""Thank you, Barbara Walters."" (Actually, Walters called her a ""potty mouth""; the Tribune cast her as Lady Macbeth. The New York Post dubbed her ""One Nasty Blagoje-bitch."")

Patti has stood by her husband since his arrest in December 2008, his impeachment the following month, the two trials (the first ended in a mostly hung jury and mistrial), and all the self-inflicted indignities of his wackadoodle publicity stunts, including getting fired by Donald Trump on The Celebrity Apprentice. In her husband's absence, she has borne the burden of being the sole caretaker and provider for their two daughters, Amy, who recently turned 21, and Annie, now 14, as well as the family's two dogs: Skittles, a Maltipoo whom Patti describes as the ""sorry-your-dad's-been-arrested dog"" the family brought home around Christmas 2008, a couple of weeks after Blagojevich's arrest, and Twix, the ""sorry-your-dad-is-going-to-jail dog,"" a mutt the family adopted in the months leading up to his imprisonment.

Single parenthood is ""a tough row to hoe,"" she says. ""But I can't indulge in feeling sorry for myself. My kids are sad and anxious, like they have PTSD. It's been really hard for them. I can't let myself go there. I've got my nervous breakdown scheduled for, like, 10 years from now, when Annie's out of college. That's when I can fall apart.""

During one of our calls, Blagojevich praises his wife for her poise and resolve in keeping the family functioning. ""I never realized Patti was as strong as she is until all this happened.""

Patti calls ""all this"" her ""lost decade"" -- beginning with the cataclysmic day that Blagojevich has referred to as the family's Pearl Harbor, when FBI agents came knocking at their door in the predawn hours to arrest her husband. Since then, Patti has reunited with her estranged father, was investigated herself for possible illegal kickbacks, got fired from her job at a nonprofit, ate a tarantula on a reality TV show in her husband's place, got her insurance licenses and started her own company selling coverage to business owners, and saw a number of friends desert her. ""What else?"" she says. ""Let's see, I've put on 20 pounds.""

Reconciling with her father was especially tough. Their once-close relationship was in tatters. Mell had helped her husband win two elections: to the Illinois General Assembly in 1992 and to Congress four years later. But then things soured. ""My dad was making all these deals without telling Rod,"" Patti says, recalling how Mell told his son-in-law whom he should hire and for what salary. ""Rod said, 'Hold on,' and my dad was like, 'You're gonna do it, and I don't want to hear anything about it.' ""

After Blagojevich was elected governor, tensions between Mell and his protégé hit a breaking point. Blagojevich couldn't stand that his father-in-law (sometimes dubbed the ""governor-in-law"") was receiving so much credit, and Mell was furious that Blagojevich was elbowing him out of the inner circle. Patti says she and her father fought viciously. ""We had, like, screaming matches. It was bad."" So bad, she recalls, that out of desperation she once anonymously called into The Dr. Laura Program radio show for advice: ""I said, 'My husband and my father are always at odds with each other, fighting, and I'm stuck in the middle here.' Her response was 'Don't let yourself be put there.' And I'm like, 'How am I supposed to do that? Thanks for nothing.' ""

After her husband's arrest, she and her father began to mend their relationship, though Blagojevich and Mell's remains frosty. (Blagojevich partially blamed Mell for his downfall; it was Mell, you might recall, who early on in his son-in-law's governorship made the public allegations of pay-to-play politics that led to intensified scrutiny from the feds. He was sore with Blagojevich for shutting down a landfill owned by Mell's relative.)

""My dad was really the only person who came to Rod before he left and said, 'Don't worry about your family -- I'll make sure they're OK,' "" says Patti. ""That's meaningful."" In 2011, the Blagojeviches put their Ravenswood Manor home on the market, saying they could no longer afford it. But Mell has helped the family stay put. He is also taking care of Amy's tuition at Northwestern University, where she's a senior. And he put Patti on his lobbying firm's payroll to keep the books and handle filings.

His stepping in was critical for the family. They had run aground financially. Just weeks after her husband's arrest and on the eve of his impeachment trial, Patti was fired from her six-figure job as the development director at the Chicago Christian Industrial League, a social service agency that served the homeless and has since been taken over by A Safe Haven. One reason given by her bosses, she says, was the distracting headlines -- and not just her husband's. Patti had come under intense scrutiny over the course of the federal probe, and her crass quotes from the recorded conversations with her husband were repeatedly cited in the indictment and in the media's coverage of the scandal.

A couple of weeks after her husband's removal from office, she was hit with a federal subpoena. Prosecutors were investigating whether Patti, who worked at the time as a real estate broker, had received hundreds of thousands of dollars for deals she had little or nothing to do with. An earlier Tribune report had found that more than three-quarters of her commissions came from clients with close political connections to or wanting to win favor from her husband. ""That was scary,"" recalls Patti. ""That thought that they could come after both of us at the same time -- that was terrifying."" Prosecutors wound up not charging Patti with any crime.

It didn't help that certain friends suddenly avoided her ""like you've got smallpox or something."" Patti was never the sort of see-and-be-seen socialite and political wife who attended every charity ball in town. Still, the invitations stopped coming. Which is fine by her. ""I stay away from that. I don't want to see all these politicians I can't stand."" She did accept one recent invitation, though, from her husband's attorney, Len Goodman, to an event held by a prochoice group. ""I remember walking in at the same time as Pat Quinn,"" she says. Her husband's successor tried to give her a warm embrace, which she rebuffed. ""I was like, 'Ecch!' ""

Her daughters have felt the impact as well. Said their dad in court: ""I've ruined their innocence. They have to face the world knowing their father is a convicted criminal. It's not like their name is Smith. They can't hide.""

The girls became accidental celebrities the day their father was arrested. Amy was 12 and Annie was 5, still asleep when he was taken away in handcuffs. Their mother took them to school without telling them what had happened. ""Annie was in kindergarten, so they didn't have computers,"" Patti recalls. ""But Amy's class was doing some kind of research, and it starts popping up on their screens. So I get a call from the principal saying, 'You should probably come pick them up before, you know, it blows up here.' "" On the car ride home, she explained the situation to them. ""It was so bad,"" she says, describing how the girls took the news.

They have struggled in the years since. ""There's never been some big, totally awful thing, just lots of little things,"" says Patti. ""Death by one thousand little cuts."" Like the classmate of Annie's who recently made a hurtful remark about her dad in a group text Annie was on. Or the school assembly at Loyola Academy, where Amy had transferred to finish up high school. ""They had a speaker from Pat Quinn's office,"" recalls Patti. ""The teacher gets up there and introduces the guy, and she says, 'He's from the governor's office -- the one who's not a criminal.' Amy just sat there. Of course she was so upset. Shortly after that, they had parent-teacher conferences. Man, I hunted her down and said, 'You owe my daughter an apology.' It's one thing to have it come from a kid, but a teacher?""

During our interviews, Patti receives multiple calls and texts from her daughters. They want to know where she is, if she's OK, and when she'll be home. After one of the texts, Patti places her cell phone on the table and frowns. ""This is one of the unfortunate side effects of all this. My children are very paranoid about my safety because I'm the only one taking care of them. Even Amy is like, 'I haven't heard from you. You didn't respond to my text. Let me know you're alive.' ""

Annie, in particular, experienced separation anxiety the first year her father was gone. ""That year she missed, like, 25 days of school,"" says Patti. ""She didn't want to leave me.""

Testifying at their father's resentencing hearing last year, the girls laid bare how difficult it has been without him around. ""The older I get, the harder it is to remember all of our times together,"" Annie told the court. ""I almost don't want to grow up because I want to wait for him to come home."" Amy followed, saying, ""I know he does his best to be there for us. But I also know that the phone calls, emails, and visits can only go so far.""

Patti talks to her husband every night, she says, usually between 9 and 10 o'clock, depending on the availability of the prison phones. The institution allots Blagojevich 300 minutes a month, and all calls, other than to his lawyer, are monitored. Patti says she looks forward to the daily chats, even if they do get monotonous. ""He always wants me to tell him something hopeful. We've had the same conversation pretty much every night for five years.""

Visiting FCI Englewood is ""physically exhausting and emotionally draining,"" Patti says, and it was especially so during the two-plus years her husband was in the low-security facility. There, guests are patted down for weapons and contraband and randomly screened to make sure they aren't carrying in drugs (their clothes are swabbed for residue). Meanwhile, Blagojevich got strip-searched before and after each visit. Recalls Patti: ""He was like, 'I'm not going through that for anybody but you guys.' ""

Blagojevich remembers the agony and the ecstasy of the first time his family came to see him, two months after he arrived. ""I looked forward to their visit with an anticipation similar to how I felt on my wedding day,"" he says. ""On the morning of the visit, I paid an inmate whose 'hustle' it was to iron prison uniforms to iron mine. It cost me four [postage] stamps.""

That same morning, Blagojevich recalls, another inmate, a drug dealer from St. Louis, approached him: ""He used to see my campaign commercials before he was sent to prison. He slept in the same cubicle as me and was aware that I was waiting to be called into the visiting room."" The man, nicknamed Boo, said he had something for him and asked Blagojevich to follow him to his bunk. There, Boo discreetly pulled out a photo album from beneath his mattress. Blagojevich assumed he was going to show him family photos. ""Instead, it was a collection of cologne samples he had torn out of magazines. There must have been dozens of them. He said he had been collecting them for years."" Speaking almost in a whisper, the inmate offered Blagojevich his pick of the bunch for his visit. ""Cologne is not sold at the commissary,"" explains Blagojevich. Boo called it the ""finishing touch.""

The visiting room at that facility is a large open area with multiple rows of plastic chairs facing each other. Blagojevich would sit on one side, his wife and girls opposite him. Physical contact was limited. ""You could give him a hug, a kiss hello, goodbye, you could hold hands across the aisle, but that's it,"" says Patti. Sharing food was prohibited. And in case you're wondering, federal prisons don't allow conjugal visits.

Visits to the camp that Blagojevich is now at are less stringent. The family sits at a four-top table in the cafeteria. They can share vending machine snacks and play cards and board games. (Even that can be irritating: Patti points out that the prison's Scrabble set is missing multiple tiles.)

Even though visits are far more pleasant -- no pat-downs or strip searches -- Patti says they aren't any less difficult emotionally. And because of this, she and the girls go less and less. The first year, Patti says, ""we went, like, every five weeks."" Now they visit about four times a year. ""At this point, nobody ever wants to go. There's a real, palpable postvisit depression. It hits you in the face what you're missing. It sends [Amy and Annie] into a tailspin when we come back.""

Not visiting as often, however, has a price, says Patti: The girls are feeling more disconnected from their father, their relationship more superficial. They don't want to talk to him as much and feel like he's becoming more of a stranger. ""It's kind of a Catch-22.""

Blagojevich tells me that he has felt the chasm widening with his daughters. He writes them long emails, he says, ""but a lot of times they don't read 'em."" A couple of years ago, at Christmas, he sent them a lengthy prayer he had penned for them. He was very proud of it. ""I probably spent 20 hours -- I spent days -- it was a labor of love. I modeled the prayer on the Psalms. It was a good use of time because it helped me get through several days, actually getting some joy about it. Then I called home, and no one said anything about the prayer. I asked Patti, 'Did they get my prayer?' She said, 'Yeah.' I said, 'What did you think of it?' She said, 'It was long.' ""

I ask Patti if the strain has ever caused her to rethink their marriage. The long pause before she answers is not necessarily because she has to think about her response but because she seems taken aback by the question. ""No,"" she finally says. ""My only explanation is, I know who he is."" He's the same man she vowed to stick by 27 years ago, for better or for worse. ""You can't dump somebody when things get tough. I made a promise, and there's no need to break that promise.""

She does wonder, though, what their relationship will be like when her husband is released. ""We'll have to be together because we want to be together. My relationship now -- I don't need him. I've been able to survive without him. I know I can exist without him."" One thing is for sure: ""When Rod comes home, I never want to talk about this again.""

During the resentencing hearing last year, Blagojevich's attorney, Len Goodman, contended that his client had become a ""different man,"" that his time in prison had changed him, that he was no longer ""arrogant"" and ""angry,"" and that he was a model inmate with a positive attitude. ""He's spent his time serving others,"" Goodman told the court. As proof, he submitted more than 100 letters from inmates who extolled Blagojevich's virtues as a friend, mentor, and teacher.

During that same hearing, Debra Bonamici, the assistant U.S. attorney, maintained that Blagojevich hadn't changed at all and pointed out that he had never taken responsibility for his crimes or shown true remorse and was thus ""a poor candidate for leniency.""

At his original sentencing -- and at his resentencing -- Blagojevich did acknowledge that he had made ""mistakes"" and exercised poor judgment. He apologized to the court and to the people of Illinois. But he has never admitted guilt for any of the crimes for which he was convicted.

I ask him in an email why he didn't plead guilty and cut a deal for a lesser sentence. ""I have from time to time during these many years away asked myself this question, especially when I see and hear how my daughters are hurting,"" he says. ""I chose to fight and not to surrender and to endure all that has come because, what other choice did I have? I firmly believe that I never crossed any lines in seeking to raise campaign contributions. ... I believed I knew what the law was and that I followed it. To say otherwise, to give in to the pressure, the threat, and the fear of a long prison sentence would be to dishonor myself, setting a cowardly example for my daughters. ... I have to live with the consequences of that decision. ... It is a hard and unhappy experience. My life has been brought to ruin. I live in exile.""

During one of our phone calls, I ask Blagojevich whether he would do anything differently if he could. ""Maybe I had too much pride,"" he says. ""I know I could've been more humble. I could've been less combative.""

In the past, Blagojevich was accused of having unbridled optimism that at times blinded him to inconvenient truths. That doesn't seem to have faded. Even though he's now down to a long-shot appeal to the Supreme Court, he is convinced that he will be vindicated: ""I still believe, ultimately, we'll prevail.""

If that attempt fails, Blagojevich's only hope would be a presidential pardon or clemency. I point out the irony: In the six years he was governor, Blagojevich denied 93 percent of the 1,024 such requests he considered and let 2,800 pile up without action, causing a massive backlog. (By comparison, Pat Quinn acted on nearly 5,000 and granted more than one-third.) ""You're right,"" Blagojevich says. ""I didn't do nearly enough. I regret that very much. I wish I knew what I know now. The sentences are extremely merciless. I've learned there's a lot of oversentencing.""

I ask him if he ever envisions making a political return. He laughs, hesitant to answer. ""The headline will be 'Blago Predicts Comeback.' ""

Then he adds that he's read Nelson Mandela's biography -- twice. ""I'm not comparing myself to Mandela by any means, but it's inspirational to read about a guy who had to sit through prison for 27 years. Look what happened to him and his political career. I'm not making any comparison there, OK? Other than to say that through him and a lot of others, I get inspiration, and it helps to give me strength to endure.""

Patti thinks that maybe her husband could write another book or find a place on the lucrative speaker circuit: ""He's got a tale to tell that I think people would pay to hear."" But if she has anything to say about it, he won't be back in the political arena. ""When he comes home, I want to live a very quiet life,"" she says. ""Who knows what he wants? If he wants to get back into politics, he'll have to do that with his second wife. No thanks.""

Unless the U.S. Supreme Court overturns his convictions, Blagojevich will almost certainly never appear on a ballot again. In fact, he's barred from holding public office in this state; the Illinois Senate made sure of that after removing him from the governorship. Nor can he practice law, as he did before going to Springfield in 1993 as a state representative; the Illinois Supreme Court suspended his license. Blagojevich also won't have his state pension to fall back on; the General Assembly Retirement System stripped him of that -- roughly $65,000 a year -- which he could have started collecting in 2011, when he reached 55. Next December, when he turns 62, he can begin collecting a federal pension, worth about $15,000 a year, for his three terms in Congress.

When I ask Blagojevich about his future, he gets uneasy. I ask him in different ways. Each time, he answers vaguely and grudgingly or changes the subject. The following is an abridged version of those responses:

""My elder daughter accuses me of being excessively optimistic, but I do believe in second acts. I do believe some of the greatest inspiration stories that help other people are those who have come back from the deepest, darkest valleys and have been able to work their way to a good place on the mountain, not necessarily on top of the mountain, but maybe way up high. I do believe that. I think of the story of David in the Bible. I'm not saying that's me. This is David. But he had faith. And during those dark periods in the wilderness, he's preparing, because he senses that there could be something. And he trusts in God. A lot of how I look at my time here is being in the wilderness and having the faith to not ever let them make me give up, but to prepare in my time here for what I believe could be a better day.""

As I listen to Blagojevich muse aloud about Mandela and David and other redemptive figures that he peppers the conversation with, it's not a big leap to think he's fantasizing about himself: being exonerated, winning an early release, being hailed as a folk hero wronged by the government -- offering him a chance to revive his political career, maybe even achieve his long-held dream of one day becoming president. Whether or not he's plotting his return, he is eager to reintroduce himself to the world: ""I'm not giving up on my future."""

Freedom of religion and belief, with interlinked freedoms of expression, association, and assembly, remains severely restricted in Uzbekistan. Forum 18's survey analysis documents violations including: raids, fines, imprisonment and torture; education and worship meetings banned without state permission; and religious literature censorship and destruction.

Freedom of religion or belief is, with intrinsically linked freedoms such as those of expression, association, and assembly, seriously restricted in Uzbekistan. Officials frequently violate freedom of thought, conscience and belief and other interlinked human rights, violating the government's legally-binding international human rights commitments. These restrictions on human rights are part of the regime's intentional systemic policy to control every aspect of society. This is why followers of all religions and beliefs - with no exceptions - face freedom of religion or belief violations.

Creating fear of the state is apparently an integral part of the policy of imposing state control of society. Physical violence and torture, or threats of this, appears to be a normal experience for anyone subjected to official hostility - it is ""routine"" as the United Nations (UN) Committee Against Torture has found. This leads to a climate of impunity for officials and the absence of the rule of law, where unjust trials with flagrant breaches of due process are normal. It is for very good reason rare for people to publicly document such abuses, for fear of state reprisals.

All exercise of freedom of religion and belief with others without state permission is illegal, including sharing any beliefs with anyone, and meeting with others for worship or the study of sacred texts in homes. ""Law enforcement"" officials raid with impunity people of all faiths meeting together to exercise freedom of religion and belief. Those taking part in such meetings are very often threatened, detained, subjected to violent physical assault and torture, given large fines, and have religious literature - including Islamic texts and the Bible - confiscated and destroyed. Officials impose severe censorship on all religious literature. Muslims meeting to study the Koran and learn how to pray at home are likely, if found, to be jailed for long periods. Strict restrictions are imposed both on observing Ramadan and on going on the haj pilgrimage to Mecca.

Context

Uzbekistan has the third largest surface area of the five Central Asian states and, with over 32 million people, the largest population. Government statistics say 83 per cent of the population are ethnic Uzbeks (regarded as being of mostly Sunni Muslim background), with 5 per cent Tajiks, some 2 per cent Kazakhs and another 2 per cent Karakalpaks (regarded as being of mostly Sunni Muslim background). Russians and other Slavs (regarded as being of mostly Orthodox background) make up less than 3 per cent.

President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has run Uzbekistan since September 2016, and has (like his predecessor Islam Karimov) never won an election judged free and fair by reputable international observers. Local and international human rights defenders have documented cases of electoral fraud, corruption, and many violations of human rights and the rule of law. Despite large mineral and other resources, much of the population remains in poverty. The country is one of the larger exporters of cotton in the world, and has for decades forced many adults and children (from the age of 10 upwards) to work its cotton fields. All profits go to the state, and environmental pollution is severe.

Islam

Islam, because it has the largest number of followers, is the community the regime is most interested in controlling. This control is mainly exercised from the inside, by for example appointing all permitted leaders and banning all public manifestations of Islam outside the state-controlled Spiritual Administration of Muslims, or Muftiate. The state through the Muftiate also controls what imams preach, and the number and location of mosques.

The state completely controls the selection, education and nomination of imams, in defiance of Article 61 of the Constitution: ""Religious organisations and associations are separate from the state and equal before the law. The state does not interfere in the activities of religious associations."" It is virtually impossible for any potential imam to graduate from a madrassah (Islamic religious college) if they are thought by the state to be critical of the regime. The National Security Service (NSS) secret police has informers and agents among students, and students have told Forum 18 that the NSS periodically summons them to be questioned about whether any student is making critical comments about the regime.

Ramadan

Ramadan each year sees stricter than usual controls on Islamic communities. In the 2016 Ramadan, the regime banned shared Muslim iftar (breaking of fast) meals in public in the capital Tashkent. The bans also appear to have covered the three-day Ramazon hayit (Id al-fitr) festival, which marks the end of the month of Ramadan and is marked with prayers and meals.

The regime also continued to ban people under 18 from attending mosques, and in Tashkent schoolteachers and police were placed at the entrances of mosques to stop people under 18 entering. In Andijan [Andijon] Region the local Education Department instructed parents to sign letters that they would not (among other things) allow their children to attend mosque prayers throughout the summer. One Andijan mosque placed a sign outside it banning children and mentally-ill children from entering. A local education official told Forum 18 that the reason for the ban was that ""children can be misled in mosques"", but would not answer when asked if this was an official opinion or why she thought state-controlled imams would mislead people.

The haj

Restrictions on how many pilgrims can take part in the annual haj pilgrimage to Mecca are severe. Only 7,200 out of a potential quota of about 30,000 allocated by the Saudi authorities (based on Muslim population numbers) travelled on the 2017 pilgrimage. An ""unwritten instruction"" bans would-be pilgrims under the age of 45. Waiting times are long. One potential pilgrim told Forum 18 in September 2015 that she would need to live to be 205 years old to reach the top of the waiting list in her mahalla. Her mahalla head told Forum 18 that she ""will be able to go in 20 or 30 years"". Even successful applicants can be arbitrarily removed and replaced with the friends or family members of officials. Also, ""unofficial payments"" to officials can more than double the cost of the haj. ""The number of applicants would be much, much higher if the cost was not so high,"" an imam who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18 in 2011.

Mahalla committees, theoretically independent but in practice under state control, are used to maintain controls over anyone trying to exercise freedom of religion and belief, and have been used to block registration attempts by Protestants and Jehovah's Witnesses (see below). They are also used in periodic crackdowns on all religious communities, as well as to monitor members of the majority Muslim community.

Pilgrims are officially screened. An application to go on the haj is made in writing, with a copy of the applicant's passport. Each mahalla committee submits to the local administration its list of applicants for the haj. Local administrations, along with the NSS secret police, the Muftiate and the state Religious Affairs Committee check each applicant and endorse or reject the application. The central mahalla of a district then compiles a waiting list of applicants. When applicants' turn to go on pilgrimage comes up, they are invited to the local district administration and instructed to collect more documents, including certificates of their place of residence, their health, and a reference letter from their local mahalla committee. The letter gives information about their personal qualities and charitable works.

Even successful passage of this process does not guarantee a haj pilgrimage. Uzbekistan uses exit visas - a Soviet-era idea - to control which of its citizens are allowed to leave the country. Citizens need an exit visa every two years to visit any other country except some other former Soviet states (the president signed a decree in August 2017 to abolish the requirement from January 2019). The NSS secret police maintains an exit blacklist - for example of human rights defenders - who may not be allowed to travel.

Officials give special instructions to successful applicants on how to behave on pilgrimage, including not to talk to foreigners. These instructions are typically given at meetings for all approved pilgrims. NSS secret police officers reportedly accompany the haj pilgrims.

Other religious communities

For other religious communities, the regime's primary interest is to keep them within closely controlled geographic and activity related boundaries. Communities of all faiths which want to gain state permission to exist - which requirement violates international human rights law - must pass through a complex registration procedure, including having 100 adult Uzbek citizens willing both to be identified as founders and to supply their personal details to the authorities. Even if communities are larger than 100 people, many are unwilling to be so identified to the authorities as founders.

The only communities allowed to exist in the north-west region of Karakalpakstan [Qoraqalpoghiston] are mosques of the state-controlled Muftiate and one Russian Orthodox parish. All other collective expressions of freedom of religion and belief are banned. A human rights defender from the region told Forum 18 in August 2017 that the regime keeps local Protestants ""in constant fear&qquot;, with surveillance, threats, raids, fines and short-term imprisonments.

Other obstacles to gaining state permission to exist for all religious communities include: paying a non-refundable fee equivalent to 50 times the minimum monthly wage; then submitting two letters of guarantee - one from the district Hokimat (administration), confirming that the organisation to be registered has a building which corresponds to health and fire safety requirements - and one from the mahalla committee (the lowest level of district administration), stating that other mahalla residents do not object to the organisation. This written approval is necessary before a religious community can even apply for state registration from the Justice Ministry. Public health, fire safety, and similar regulations have also been used to bar registration and to harass religious communities, through inspections allegedly to check whether registered communities are observing regulations.

The ban on the unregistered exercise of freedom of religion and belief is underpinned by various articles in the Criminal Code and the Administrative Code. Administrative Code Article 240 (""Violation of the Religion Law""), Part 1 punishes: ""Carrying out of unauthorised religious activity, evasion by leaders of religious organisations of registration of the charter of the organisation, and the organisation and conduct of special children's and youth meetings, as well as vocational, literature and other study groups not relating to worship"". Punishments range from fines of 50 to 100 times the minimum monthly wage to being jailed for up to 15 days.

Even when a religious community has followed the state's demands and obtained permission to exist from a local authority, registration - and hence permission to exercise freedom of religion and belief - can still be refused. Indeed, many religious communities do not get as far as this. Registration of new communities, or communities which have long existed but which the regime does not like - such as Jehovah's Witnesses - remains almost impossible. It also does not guarantee that they will keep registration and stay open if granted registration - even if they comply in full with all the authorities' formal demands.

Religious communities - whether Muslim or of other faiths - are not able to buy, build or open places of worship freely. Some places of worship have been confiscated, many rural mosques having reportedly been closed or stripped of their registration. Similarly, some Protestant, Jehovah's Witness, Hare Krishna and Baha'i communities have been stripped of registration for no known reason.

Although Uzbek is the state language, the authorities ban non-Muslim communities from using it as the main language for worship services. The authorities have never explained why they impose this ban, which is not enshrined in any published law.

The experience of many communities, registered or unregistered, is that repression can occur at any time, with no regard for whether or not a community is registered. Police and NSS secret police raids, or expulsions of Muslim, Protestant and Hare Krishna university students affect followers of registered or unregistered communities.

Even if communities are registered, they are subject to intrusive demands from the authorities. In April 2007, Andijan [Andijon] regional Hokimat ordered a pastor of a registered Protestant church to draw up a plan with the Religious Affairs Committee ""to prevent missionary activity"". Communities like the Council of Churches Baptists who - as is their right in international law - refuse to seek registration with the state are targeted for raids and large fines. They refuse on principle to register, as they have found that registration leads to state interference in the exercise by their communities of freedom of religion and belief in line with international human rights law.

Surveillance

State officials control all exercise of freedom of religion and belief. The NSS secret police carries out both covert and open surveillance of all religious communities. Members of a variety of religious communities have told Forum 18 of hidden microphones in places of worship, the presence of NSS agents during meetings for worship, and the recruitment of spies within communities - including among leaders.

In March 2017, Protestants in Tashkent suspected that a woman who attended their meetings for worship might be an informer for the authorities. They told Forum 18 that she was the last before a raid to enter a flat where five Protestant women were meeting to discuss their faith, left the door unlocked ""against security measures"", and hung a towel from the window of the flat before the raid. ""We think that the towel may have been a sign to the authorities that we were having a teaching session,"" Protestants stated.

Even Uzbek citizens outside the country face regime attempts to stop them exercising freedom of religion and belief. Davron Komoliddinov was jailed in November 2015 for seven years after being extradited from Russia, for posting Islamic sermons on a Russian social media network. Human rights defenders say the regime often uses Uzbek labour migrants to Russia to incriminate other Uzbek migrants they work or live with. The authorities usually extort confessions from one or two such labour migrants against others, and then use Interpol to search for those they want. Prisoner of conscience Komoliddinov was tortured after an unfair trial and his state-appointed defence lawyer, who relatives state did not participate in hearings, told Forum 18 that he was asked to participate by the NSS secret police.

""Legally"" preventing human rights

Punishments can continue and be imposed disproportionately for a long time after an alleged ""offence"". In 2012 Gulchohra Norbayeva was fired her from her job as a teacher for insisting on wearing the hijab (Islamic headscarf). But even some years later she still faced police summonses, house searches for religious literature, accusations she was teaching the Koran ""illegally"", and pressure to sign statements incriminating Muslim men she did not know. Police told her that whether or not she wears the hijab, she will remain on the Preventative Register.

This Register was created under the 2014 Law on Prevention of Violations of the Law, which gives wide-ranging powers to state bodes, including committees which run mahallas [local districts], as well as non-state and non-commercial public organisations and ordinary citizens. This formalised what already happens in practice, and among the Law's targets are people exercising freedom of religion or belief or other human rights without state permission.

The Prevention Law automatically places people convicted by the courts on a Preventive Register, subjecting them to a variety of police ""preventative measures"" for one year or more. Many state-run organisations, from health care to nature protection agencies, are able to initiate placing individuals on the Preventive Register, including allowing many possibilities for officials to arbitrarily arrange for people to stay on the Register for many years. The Law also gives mahalla committees wide powers to among other things with police ""take measures to prevent the activity of unregistered religious organisations"". It also ""legalises unofficial informers"" a legal expert from Tashkent noted to Forum 18.

Article 29 of the Prevention Law specifies ""prevention measures"" used against individuals, including: prophylactic talks; official warnings; ""social rehabilitation""; placing on the Preventive Register; referral for compulsory treatment; and administrative supervision.

Under Article 31 individuals are required to sign any written warning they are given. If the individual refuses to sign, this is also noted. The official issuing the warning can also inform the individual's employer (if they are working), their educational establishment (if they are studying), and the mahalla committee where they live.

Article 34 states that those on the Preventive Register are subjected to a range of preventive measures from the police aimed at ""correcting them and warning against the conducting of repeat offences"". Those subjected to the Preventive Register include former prisoners, as well as those convicted of a wide range of administrative offences.

If an individual has been punished for more than one separate crime or offence, they are listed on the Preventive Register separately for each reason.

Censorship and raids to ""isolate the population""

Religious literature in Uzbekistan is under tight state control. Summarising the reason for censorship and raids targeting religious texts, a March 2016 state news agency article stated that the government aimed to ""isolate the population"". The import and production of literature - including the Koran and the Bible - is strictly controlled. This includes material on mobile phones, tablets, personal computers, memory sticks and other electronic devices and media, with compulsory prior censorship by the Religious Affairs Committee. The International Post Office confirmed to Forum 18 in 2007 that imported copies of the Koran in Arabic were censored by the Religious Affairs Committee. Only registered communities can seek permission to print or import material.

A January 2014 Cabinet of Ministers Decree on religious literature requires the State Customs Committee and the State Borders Protection Committee (part of the NSS secret police) to confiscate all religious materials being imported, even for private use only. They are to be sent for ""expert analysis"" by the Religious Affairs Committee, and only if approved handed back to travellers.

Criminal Code Article 246 Part 1 punishes ""Smuggling, that is carriage through the customs border .. without the knowledge of or with concealment from customs control .. materials that propagandise religious extremism, separatism, and fundamentalism"". This is punishable by imprisonment for between 10 and 20 years. Along with Criminal Code Article 244-1 (see below) it has since 2013 increasingly been used to prosecute and jail Muslims carrying the Koran and Islamic sermons on mobile phones.

Relatively little literature about the majority Islamic faith is allowed to be published, and none is imported officially. Some Islamic books are no longer published, such as Imam Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari's book ""Sahih al-Bukhari"". This is a collection of hadiths which Sunni Muslims regard as the most authentic compilation.

Censorship of religious literature is required under Article 19 of the Religion Law. Only central administrations of registered religious organisations (i.e. those that have registered communities in at least eight of Uzbekistan's 14 Regions) are allowed to produce, import, export or distribute religious literature. The Article adds: ""Delivery and distribution of religious literature published abroad is done after expert analysis of its contents is carried out in the order prescribed by law."" The Article also bans the ""manufacture, storage and distribution of printed items, films, photographs, audio and video recordings and other materials containing ideas of religious extremism, separatism and fundamentalism"".

Administrative Code Article 184-2 punishes: ""Illegal production, storage, or import into Uzbekistan, with the intent to distribute or actual distribution, of religious materials by physical persons"". Punishments are a fine of between 20 and 150 times the minimum monthly wage, ""with confiscation of the religious materials and the relevant means of their production and distribution"". Criminal Code Article 244-3 punishes ""illegal production, storage, import or distribution of religious literature"". It carries - if there has been a previous administrative conviction - punishment of a fine of between 100 and 200 times the minimum monthly wage, or up to three years' corrective labour.

Religious literature (including Korans and Bibles), videos, DVDs - whether Muslim, Protestant Christian, Jehovah's Witness, Baha'i or of other faiths - are routinely confiscated in ordinary police and NSS secret police raids on places of worship and homes. Even legally imported materials as well as Uzbek-produced materials that have passed the censorship are confiscated. The Religious Affairs Committee routinely tells prosecutors and courts that such literature is ""extremist"", ""banned"" or ""not for use outside a registered religious community"".

""Expert analyses"", book burning

Either the state's Religious Affairs Committee or - in provincial areas - teachers at local university philosophy departments decide whether religious material should be banned by producing so-called ""expert analyses"". Courts frequently order that such confiscated material be destroyed.

Courts often ignore legal violations in ""expert analyses"". A November 2012 ""analysis"" prepared by Begzod Kadyrov, Chief Specialist of the government's Religious Affairs Committee, claimed he had within one day read 1,300 books, 2,100 brochures, 450 leaflets, 50 magazines, watched 200 video cassette tapes, and listened to 350 audio cassette-tapes. ""This beats the Guinness Book of Records"", a local Protestant observed to Forum 18. Violations of legal procedure are commonplace in such cases, such as when a court ordered a Bible and New Testament destroyed after an ""expert analysis"" by an official of the local Muslim Board. This occurred even though the Religious Affairs Committee is the only body authorised to conduct such ""analyses"".

Such alleged ""expert analyses"" are routinely used as an excuse to confiscate any book the authorities decide to confiscate. Numerous court verdicts seen by Forum 18 order that such literature - including Muslim books or Christian Bibles - be destroyed, which is often carried out by burning. In March 2017 Judge Alisher Kahharov fined Dilorom Khudoybergenova 100 times the monthly minimum wage, ordered the confiscation of her mobile phone, and ordered the destruction of a book after police found her carrying her groceries and a book containing the three short New Testament texts the First, Second, and Third Letters of John with commentaries in Uzbek.

Postal and electronic censorship

Uzbekistan's postal authorities actively collaborate in censorship of publications sent from abroad. One customs Inspector told Forum 18 that 80 to 90 per cent of all imported or posted religious literature confiscated is Muslim. The Post Office routinely opens parcels of religious books and magazines sent from abroad, sending examples to the Religious Affairs Committee who decide whether to destroy the literature or return it to the sender. ""I do not understand why normal religious books need to be confiscated or destroyed"", a post office employee told Forum 18 in October 2011. But, they continued, ""we are small persons, and need to obey orders"". Information from abroad on the internet which the authorities dislike, including Forum 18's own website, also continues to be blocked.

Criminal Code Article 244-1 punishes the ""production, storage, distribution or display of materials containing a threat to public security and public order"". Its paragraph 2 punishes: ""Dissemination of materials containing ideas of religious extremism, separatism, and fundamentalism, calls for pogroms or violent eviction, or aimed at creating panic among the population, as well as the use of religion for purposes of breach of civil concord, dissemination of calumnious and destabilising fabrications, and committing other acts aimed against the established rules of conduct in society and public order"".

Part 1 of the Article punishes ""production and storage"". Part 2 punishes ""dissemination"". Part 3 (a) punishes this ""crime"" with prior planning or by groups of individuals, Part 3 (b) punishes it by officials, and Part 3 (c) punishes this ""with financial or other material aid from religious organisations, as well as foreign states, organisations, and citizens"".

In April 2016, Article 244-1's possible punishments were increased to imprisonment of between 5 and 8 years, instead of the previous up to 5 years' jail or a fine of between 300 and 400 times the minimum monthly wage. It is normally used only against Muslims exercising their freedom of religion and belief.

The growth in the use of electronic devices in recent years has seen officials devote increasing attention to them. Officials often search mobile phones and other electronic devices in the hunt for religious materials. Punishments can be severe, and from around 2013 the authorities have often jailed for up to five years or fined Muslims (including foreign citizens) found with the Koran and Muslim sermons on their mobile phones. As with other ""crimes"", a local Christian leader told Forum 18 in June 2016, ""the authorities usually fine or jail for short periods of time Christians and people from other non-Muslim communities"".

From April 2016, a new Criminal Code Article 244-1 Part 3 (d) banned ""criminal"" activities ""using the mass media or telecommunication networks, as well as the world wide web"". At the same time the regime harshened Criminal Code Articles 244-1 and 244-2 (see below) to allow: criminal prosecutions without a previous Administrative Code prosecution; increased jail terms, including between 15 and 20 years jail for involving people under 16 in ""illegal"" religious organisations; a ban on ""production, storage or dissemination of the ideas or symbols of religious extremist or terrorist organisations""; and increased mass media, telecommunications and internet restrictions.

One human rights defender, Shukhrat Rustamov, commented to Forum 18 in June 2016 that the April 2016 amendments - as well as the existing Religion Law, Criminal and Administrative Codes - are against the Constitution. He noted that, with the changes, ""the authorities want to impose a total blockade of information for religious believers"".

No religious books allowed in homes

Police confiscate personal religious literature during raids on homes, including Arabic-language Korans, and Uzbek and Russian-language Bibles and New Testaments. Courts frequently order such religious literature - including Bibles and New Testaments - destroyed. Raids and searches can be on a large scale. In March 2016, 20 NSS secret police and ordinary police officers searched every home in an entire district of the capital Tashkent. Local police told Forum 18 that ""we have religious freedoms"".

Followers of a variety of beliefs are afraid to keep religious literature in their homes, a cross-section of people have told Forum 18. Baptists told Forum 18 in June 2013 that ""Church members have repeatedly been warned recently that keeping a Bible at home is allowed, but reading it can only be done at specially designated places for carrying out religious rituals"". Such warnings are set out in ""expert analyses"" of confiscated literature by the Religious Affairs Committee, and presented to courts to justify confiscations and fines on owners. After an early 2017 raid on a Tashkent Hare Krishna devotee's home resulting in the confiscation of about 40 religious books and a fine, the Religious Affairs Committee told her that devotees can have only one copy of the faith's five main books at home. Any other books have to be held at their state-registered temple in Tashkent.

Raids to seize ""illegal"" religious literature frequently involve the authorities breaking published laws, but no officials are known to have been held to account for this. Asked in June 2016 whether people have freedom of religion and belief, a Judge told Forum 18 ""maybe"". Many Christians have hidden their religious literature, the Protestant noted. Other Christians have taken all the books they have to state-registered places of worship. The state's pressure is so strong that some believers think they have no choice but to destroy their own sacred texts. The Protestant also cited with distress cases where individuals have reluctantly destroyed their own Christian books, including Bibles. ""I personally know of three such cases,"" the Protestant told Forum 18. ""Many other Christians said to me they can't bring themselves to destroy their Bibles.""

Meeting with others for worship or the study of sacred texts in homes is banned. In June 2016 four leaders of a Sufi Naqshbandi Muslim community were jailed for 4 years under Criminal Code Article 216 (""Illegal establishment or reactivation of illegal public associations or religious organisations, as well as active participation in their activities""). The four leaders were among 15 Sufis arrested in Karakul District during a police raid on a home where a community was performing the zikr, a devotional practice of reciting sacred phrases. The following month, 11 other members of the same community were each fined up to 4,000,000 Soms (then 11,000 Norwegian Kroner, 1,200 Euros or 1,300 US Dollars at the highly inflated official exchange rate) for illegally meeting in homes.

Similarly, in August 2015 four members of two Muslim families near Tashkent were jailed for between one and two months and about 18 others were fined under Administrative Code Article 201, Part 2 for: ""Violation of the procedure for holding religious meetings, street processions, or other religious ceremonies"". Ten women were then detained and fined for the same ""offence"", one woman being threatened with being jailed with men who might rape her. So-called ""Anti-Terrorism Police"" then raided the homes of eight male relatives of the women who met occasionally to pray together, discuss their faith and share meals. The men were warned that they too would be jailed if they did not stop praying together. As these cases illustrate, the regime's definition of terrorism includes people exercising their human rights.

Non-Muslims are also targeted. Between January and May 2016, 18 Protestants and 11 Jehovah's Witnesses were each fined up to 60 times the minimum monthly wage. ""Anti-Terrorism Police"" with ordinary police often conduct illegal searches of homes without a search warrant, as happened in some cases. Known cases also involve Jehovah's Witnesses being stopped and searched as they left Fergana [Farghona], and the possible use of a police agent provocateur to entrap two Urgench [Urganch] female Jehovah's Witnesses as they shared their beliefs and literature with a woman in a flat. In May 2016, a Judge upheld fines for illegal religious literature on 14 Protestants who met to mark International Woman's Day, the fines totalling 350 times the minimum monthly wage.

The ban on religious literature in homes causes particular difficulties for those who do not have state-registered places of worship, such as Council of Churches Baptists. Contrary to Uzbekistan's international human rights obligations, the state bans Council of Churches Baptists from having places of worship where religious literature might be kept.

Religious texts in public places also face a de facto ban. In spring 2015, Doniyor Akhmedov - a Baptist - was one of three Protestants in Uzbekistan known to have been imprisoned for between seven and 15 days. He was held after offering a religious leaflet to a passer-by on the street. For the last part of his 15-day imprisonment, Akhmedov ""was held in a small cell with more than 10 people, where they were squeezed in and there was barely space to sleep on the floor"", Forum 18 was told. After he was freed he was fined more than three years' official minimum wage.

Torture

Violence and torture, or threats of this, by police and other officials are ""routine"" the UN Committee Against Torture found in 2007. Torture methods used include asphyxiation with a gas mask (which police call the ""little elephant"") and severe physical violence including rape, leading to concussion accompanied by police pressure on hospitals not to treat victims. Torture and threats usually follow the frequent police and secret police raids against unregistered religious communities.

The UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which Uzbekistan acceded to on 28 September 1995, defines torture as: ""any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity"".

Under Article 6 of the Convention, Uzbekistan is obliged to arrest any person suspected on good grounds of having committed torture. Under Article 4, Uzbekistan is obliged to try them under criminal law which makes ""these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature"". No such arrests or prosecutions are known to have happened.

Many victims (including children) of widespread use of torture normally choose not to complain or make their suffering public, because of the traumatic nature of their experiences, fear of state reprisals, and strong social pressures against women in particular speaking out about male violence. In addition, cultural traditions of ""honour"" can destroy a woman's reputation if she is known or thought to have been the victim of sexual violence or even if she has been alone - for example overnight - with male police officers who are unrelated to her.

Women in particular are often assaulted, including the use of sexual violence, by male officials. In July 2017 ordinary police and ""Anti-Terrorism Police"" in Urgench raided a meeting where 27 Protestants were worshipping. Some of the 25 officers were carrying machine guns, and only six were in police uniform. During the arrests, interrogations, and literature confiscations which followed, the women were forcibly undressed down to their underwear. Police denied any knowledge of this when questioned by Forum 18.

Similarly, in February 2016, four female Jehovah's Witnesses in Samarkand were questioned by senior police station officer Sanjar Esanov, his subordinates Lieutenant Askarali Boykobilov and Officer Sobir Rakhimov, as well as Khusrav Shamsiyev of Samarkand's ""Anti-Terrorism Police"". The officers were ""drunk and very aggressive"", Jehovah's Witnesses told Forum 18. ""They demanded that the women deny their faith."" Lieutenant Boykobilov ""roughly grasped the shoulders of [one of the women] and kept pushing her"". Another was also ""pushed"", and Officer Shamsiyev ""slapped her on the face"". Chief Officer Esanov took another of the four women to a dark room and ""strangled her and hit her on the body"", as did officer Rakhimov. Officer Esanov threatened to ""undress her and rape her, after which he will take her out of the room naked so the others could see. Then he began unbuttoning her overcoat but she resisted and he stopped"".

Officials ignore formal complaints about torture. In June 2013, officers at a police station in the north-western Khorezm Region hit Sardorbek Nurmetov, a Protestant, five times on the head and chest with a thick book, and kicked his legs. As a result, Nurmetov became ""dizzy, weakened, and felt like vomiting"". Police refused his requests to call an ambulance. After he went to hospital on being released, hospital officials - who refused to send an ambulance when they realised it was to help a torture victim - themselves informed police, who took Nurmetov to a police station to pressure him not to complain. Despite this, Nurmetov did submit a formal complaint at the police station, demanding that action be taken. Urgench Police, instead of taking action against those implicated in the crime of torture, opened an administrative case against Nurmetov for ""illegally"" storing religious materials in his home.

Children and young people

Police and schoolteachers have told children that if they attend any place of worship - including mosques and churches - they will be punished. Children and young people are not formally banned from attending meetings for worship, but officials frequently pressure parents and communities of all faiths not to allow them to attend. In August 2014 teachers and doctors were forced to help the police identify school-age boys attending worship in Tashkent mosques ""and to prevent them from participating in prayers, especially Friday prayers,"" human rights defender Abdurakhmon Eshanov told Forum 18. Deputy Chief Mufti Abdulaziz Mansurov claimed to Forum 18 that both Sharia law and the Religion Law ban children from attending prayers. He then added: ""I wish the Law would allow it"". After ""Anti-Terrorism Police"" raids in Namangan Region on Baptists and Jehovah's Witnesses, state-sponsored media attacks noted that ""even under-age children"" had been present at their meetings.

Even nursing infants can be targeted. In Tashkent in November 2015 ""Anti-Terrorism Police"" raided a Protestant home after the headteacher of a school told District Police that two pupils were sharing their beliefs with fellow-pupils. Officers physically tortured detained Protestants, and prevented the parents of five nursing infants from feeding their infants unless they wrote statements against fellow-Protestants. A court later fined them for exercising freedom of religion and belief.

Official imams have complained that they cannot teach Islam to children. Non-state controlled religious education is forbidden. In June 2013 a Muslim father and son who taught the Koran to school-age children in Tashkent Region were prosecuted. Both men - Mirmuhiddin Mirbayzaiyev and his son Sirojiddin - faced the possibility of up to three years in jail. Parents who brought their children to the Islamic religious lessons were fined.

""Legal"" framework a symptom not a cause of human rights violations

Numerous articles in the Religion Law, Criminal Code and Code of Administrative Offences are, as already noted, used to punish anyone exercising their freedom of religion and belief. Legal charges brought against people do not necessarily reflect what they actually did. This can lead to people being charged using laws punishing the exercise of freedom of religion and belief, when this freedom is not involved in the actions they actually carried out. It can also, as noted below, lead to accusations of violence being made against people without any credible evidence that they carried out or have any sympathy with acts of violence.

Similarly, vague definitions of the ""offences"" banned - such as ""proselytism"" or ""missionary activity"" - leave much room for frequently exercised arbitrary official interpretations.

Article 8 of the Religion Law contains an implicit ban on the unregistered exercise of freedom of religion and belief. It states that ""a religious organisation has the status of a juridical person and can carry out its activities only after registration by the Justice Ministry or its local branches"". This making of the exercise of human rights dependent on state permission is contrary to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Uzbekistan in 1995. Article 8 also states that a central agency of a religious organisation must be registered by communities ""in at least eight territorial divisions of the republic of Uzbekistan (a region, the city of Tashkent or the Republic of Karakalpakstan)"". The Russian Orthodox, the Baptist Union (as against unregistered Baptists), Catholics and Pentecostals are currently the only smaller religious communities with a central administration. As the majority of smaller communities have not managed to be registered in eight territorial divisions, they have no right either to exist.

Religion Law Article 9 therefore also bars communities from carrying out normal activities, for example by allowing only communities with a central administration to run a religious educational establishment, and only if they get state registration for such an establishment. ""Religious educational establishments acquire the right to operate after registering with the Justice Ministry and receiving the appropriate licence,"" it states. ""Persons teaching religious subjects at religious educational establishments must have a religious education and carry out their work with the permission of the appropriate agency of the central administration.""

Fines for a wide range of manifestations of freedom of religion and belief - including activity without state permission - are generally 50 to 100 times the minimum monthly wage. The numbers and scale of raids and fines imposed on members of smaller religious communities may be increasing. Raids are usually accompanied by the confiscation of all religious literature officials find, while participants are often threatened or tortured.

In addition to fines, punishments under the Administrative Code for the ""illegal"" exercise of freedom of religion and belief can involve short-term detention of between 3 and 15 days, which is irregularly used against Protestants, Jehovah's Witnesses and Baha'is. However, fines are a more common punishment.

Other ""laws"" used to prosecute people exercising their right to freedom of religion and belief include:

- Administrative Code Article 201, Part 2 punishing: ""Violation of the procedure for holding religious meetings, street processions, or other religious ceremonies"". This is punishable with a fine of between 80 and 100 times the minimum monthly wage, or being jailed for up to 15 days.

- Administrative Code Article 202 punishing: ""Granting to the participants of gatherings, meetings, and street demonstrations without state permission premises or other property (means of communication, copying and other machines, equipment, transportation), or the creation of other conditions for conducting such activity"". Punishments are fines of between 50 and 100 times the minimum monthly wage for ordinary citizens, and between 70 and 150 times the minimum monthly wage for officials.

- Criminal Code Article 216-1, which punishes: ""Inducement to participate in the operation of illegal public associations, religious organisations, movements, or sects"". This carries penalties of between a fine of 25 times the monthly minimum wage and three years' Imprisonment. This Article has occasionally in the past been used against Jehovah's Witnesses.

- Administrative Code Article 194, Part 1 punishing: ""Failure to carry out the lawful demands of a police officer or other persons carrying out duties to guard public order"". Punishments are a fine of up to twice the minimum monthly wage.

- and Administrative Code Article 195 (""Resisting the orders of police officers"") carries punishments of between three times the minimum monthly wage and 15 days' detention.

Although members of smaller religious communities are often fined, they are not - unlike Muslims - often jailed for long periods. One exception was a Baptist, Tohar Haydarov, who received a 10-year sentence on fabricated drug-related charges in March 2010 and was released in November 2016.

Sharing any beliefs with anyone is punishable under a variety of laws. These include:

- Article 5 of the Religion Law, which states that: ""Actions aimed at attracting believers of one confession to another (proselytism) are forbidden, as is other missionary activity"";

- Administrative Code Article 240 (""Violation of the Religion Law"") Part 2, which punishes ""attracting believers of one confession to another (proselytism) and other missionary activity"". Punishments are fines of between 50 and 100 times the minimum monthly wage, or being jailed for up to 15 days;

- Administrative Code Article 241, which punishes: ""Teaching religious beliefs without specialised religious education and without permission from the central organ of a [registered] religious organisation, as well as teaching religious beliefs privately"". Punishments range from fines of 5 to 10 times the minimum monthly wage, or being jailed for up to 15 days.

- and Criminal Code Article 216-2, Part 2, which punishes: ""Attracting believers of one faith to another (proselytism) and other missionary activity, after the application of penalties under the Code of Administrative Offences for similar activities"" with punishment of a fine, community service, one to three years' restricted freedom or up to three years in prison.

Reinforcing the bans on sharing beliefs and on religious small groups, Criminal Code Article 229-2 punishes: ""Teaching religious beliefs without specialised religious education and without permission from the central organ of a [registered] religious organisation, as well as teaching religious beliefs privately"". Punishments range from fines of 50 to 100 times the minimum monthly wage, community service, corrective labour, restricted freedom or imprisonment for up to three years.

Criminal Code Article 216-2, Part 1 punishes ""illegal religious activity, evasion of registration of a religious organisation's charter by its leaders, conducting special meetings for young people, work groups, and other circles and groups, unrelated to worship, by religious leaders and members of religious organisations."" Punishments range from a fine of between 50 and 100 times the minimum wage, community service, between one and three years' restricted freedom, or up to three years in prison.

Muslims exercising their freedom of religion and belief have been prosecuted under many of the above articles, but appear to be more likely to be prosecuted under the Criminal Code. Articles not listed above also mainly used against Muslims include:

- Article 156, Part 2 (""Deliberate acts intended to humiliate ethnic honour and dignity, insult the religious or atheistic feelings of individuals, carried out with the purpose of inciting hatred, intolerance, or divisions on a national, ethnic, racial, or religious basis, as well as the explicit or implicit limitation of rights or preferences on the basis of national, racial, or ethnic origin, or religious beliefs""). This Article has also been used against members of smaller religious communities. As Protestants within Uzbekistan have noted, the state's own incitement of religious intolerance and hatred violates this part of the Criminal Code.

- Various parts of Article 159 (""Attempts to change the Constitutional order""), punishable by up to 10 years in jail. Parts of this Article penalise the use of violence, such accusations often being made against Muslims irrespective of what they did;

- Article 216 (""Illegal establishment or reactivation of illegal public associations or religious organisations, as well as active participation in their activities""), punishable by up to 5 years in jail. This was one of the Articles used against Muslim Khayrullo Tursunov, extradited back to his native Uzbekistan from Kazakhstan in March 2013 against the express wishes of the UN Committee Against Torture, who was the following June given a 16-year jail sentence for the alleged ""extremist"" exercise of freedom of religion and belief.

- Article 242 (""Organisation of a criminal society""), punishable by up to 20 years in jail;

- and Criminal Code Article 244-2, Part 1 (""Creation, leadership or participation in religious extremist, separatist, fundamentalist or other banned organisations""). In April 2016 the regime harshened Criminal Code Articles 244-1 (see above) and 244-2 to allow: criminal prosecutions without a previous Administrative Code prosecution; increased jail terms, including between 15 and 20 years jail for involving people under 16 in ""illegal"" religious organisations; a ban on ""production, storage or dissemination of the ideas or symbols of religious extremist or terrorist organisations""; and increased mass media, telecommunications and internet restrictions.

These changes were soon used. In May 2016, Jonibek Turdiboyev and Mansurkhon Akhmedov were both jailed for five years under the new Criminal Code Article 244-2, Part 1. The only evidence brought by the prosecution consisted of statements from an existing prisoner and a claim that the authorities had found a Muslim sermon under music on an audio disc. Relatives and human rights defenders insist that the two prisoners of conscience are ""guilty"" only of being devout Muslims exercising their freedom of religion and belief.

Administrative Code deportation possibilities for exercising freedom of religion and belief were also extended in April 2016. Taken together, the changes target Muslims exercising the freedoms of religion and belief, and of expression, and give more possibilities to prosecute non-Muslims.

Unfair trials

Trials are often conducted unfairly, and officials who violate laws supposedly defending human rights appear never to be prosecuted or punished. A typical example was the May 2016 trial of Muslim prisoners of conscience Turdiboyev and Akhmedov noted above. Human rights defender Shukhrat Rustamov noted that the ""witness confessions"" used to convict the prisoners were obtained through torture, and the prisoners of conscience themselves insisted at the trial that they were forced to sign their own ""confessions"" against their will. Rustamov also noted that Tashkent Police violated legal procedures in the investigation, but that the Prosecutor's Office and the Court ignored this. Rustamov also pointed out that:

- signatures of the police investigators in the indictment were not endorsed by a police seal, and are false;

- Turdiboyev was claimed to be initially detained on 16 November 2015, but was really detained on 12 November;

- police claimed Turdiboyev was interrogated on 26 June 2015, but on this date he was unaware of any police investigation of himself and was not questioned;

- and a signature claimed to be Turdiboyev's on a 30 January 2016 report claiming he was informed of the ""expert analysis"" of the CD is not Turdiboyev's signature.

""Expert analyses"" are often used to secure convictions and evidence is often claimed to be fabricated by the authorities (see above).

Asked why police falsified Turdiboyev's signatures and other statements, Investigator Otabek Begmatov told Forum 18: ""We did our investigation, and if you have questions you can ask the court."" He then declined to talk further.

The authorities can also coerce ""witnesses"" into testifying against their will. In July 2017 officials forced a Russian Orthodox priest to attend what Baptists called a ""show trial"" (shown on state-controlled television) of Baptists being prosecuted for meeting for worship without state permission. The priest told Forum 18 ""it was not my desire to attend the trial. The Judge [Azamat Khushvakhtov] called me and told me I must participate. When I tried to resist the invitation, he put pressure on me, saying that if I do not come it will not be good for the Church."" Judge Khushvakhtov ""asked me if we have religious freedoms and, as a representative of Christians, what we must do. I cited the Apostle Paul, saying that we need to obey the authorities, since all authority is from God. I then added that this was unless that obedience goes against our conscience and moral principles."" The priest stressed that ""I have nothing against the Baptists"".

Two Baptists were each given five-day prison terms and three more fined. The Judge refused to answer Forum 18's questions.

Prisoners of conscience

Reportedly, thousands of Muslims have been imprisoned on accusations of belonging to terrorist, extremist or banned organisations, or related to exercising freedom of religion and belief. The nature of the ""justice system"", in which the planting of evidence and torture is normal, makes it unlikely that the authorities - or anyone else - knows how many of these prisoners are guilty of involvement in violence or other crime, or are only ""guilty"" of being devout Muslims who take their faith seriously. Indeed, Forum 18 has spoken to police who arrested people but were unaware of any offence the people arrested had committed. The only reason for such arrests was that a higher official had ordered someone to be arrested without stating why.

Uzbekistan contains violent groups which oppose the state, even though their violence is infrequent, but the authorities' own violence and injustice fuels support for such groups. When Forum 18 has asked Uzbeks who sympathise with such groups why they do so, they often indicate that their sympathy is motivated by a dislike of the regime's oppressive actions.

As well as those noted above, other Muslims known to have been jailed for exercising freedom of religion and belief include Mehrinisso Hamdamova and two other women, who were arrested for holding Muslim meetings without state permission and jailed for up to seven years in April 2010. She was due to be released in November 2016 but, despite suffering from a myoma (a tumour associated with uterine cancer), was given an additional three-year prison term. In August 2016 her sister Zulhumor who was due to be released in May 2016, had her prison term extended by three years for alleged violation of prison rules. Both sisters' health has long caused serious concern, and the authorities have denied them medical treatment.

The UN Committee Against Torture in its concluding observations on Uzbekistan's record (CAT/C/UZB/CO/4), adopted on 14 November 2013, stated: ""The Committee is concerned about numerous, ongoing and consistent allegations that torture and ill-treatment are routinely used by law enforcement, investigative and prison officials, or at their instigation or with their consent, often to extract confessions or information to be used in criminal proceedings"".

Human rights defenders, prisoners' relatives, former prisoners, and others have told Forum 18 that the authorities: routinely ignore UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Mandela Rules); force prisoners of conscience jailed for exercising freedom of religion or belief to publicly ""renounce"" their ""crimes"", and hold them separately and allocate them the heaviest and most dangerous work; hold prisoners in unsanitary and dangerous living and working conditions, which cause a high level of sickness among prisoners; torture prisoners; use criminal gangs to monitor and intimidate prisoners of conscience jailed for exercising their freedom of religion and belief; ban visits to prisoners by relatives without apparent reason; ban clergy visits from even the belief communities the state permits to exist; provide poor food; in at least one case apparently deliberately expose a prisoner of conscience jailed for exercising freedom of religion and belief to the potentially fatal disease of tuberculosis; allow doctors to seek bribes from prisoners who fall ill; deny medical treatment and medicines they need to prisoners who fall ill; sometimes misappropriate medicines which relatives are forced to buy; punish prisoners who try to exercise their freedom of religion or belief, for example by openly praying; ban prisoners from reading the Koran, Bible or other religious literature; and subject to censorship and even block letters from relatives and others.

People can also be jailed because of relatives exercising their freedom of religion and belief. Nearly three years into a 10-year prison term, Nilufar Rahimjanova died in September 2014 aged 37 in the women's labour camp near Tashkent. Relatives say the mother of four was imprisoned to punish her husband in Iran and father in Tajikistan, both Muslim theologians the Uzbek authorities dislike. Officials handed Rahimjanova's body not to her husband or father, but to her brother in Tashkent. He was told to bury it quickly in Uzbekistan without a post-mortem examination. Erkin Bobokulov, Deputy Head of the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments, did not answer Forum 18's questions.

Jail terms can be arbitrarily extended, as happened to the Hamdamova sisters. Sunni Muslim prisoner of conscience Kamol Odilov was given an extra prison term in January 2016, just days before he completed his six-year prison term imposed in 2010 for exercising freedom of religion or belief. He and his fellow Muslims had met to discuss the works of the late Turkish Muslim theologian Said Nursi. Prison authorities claim he got into a fight. ""This is absurd - he wouldn't have fought with anyone, still less on his last day,"" a Muslim familiar with the case told Forum 18. In 2015 a three-year extra prison term was handed to another Sunni Muslim prisoner of conscience from Bukhara, Botir Tukhtamurodov, after he too had completed a six-year prison term. Officials told Tukhtamurodov and his relatives that he will not be freed until the authorities get back his brother Bobirjon Tukhtamurodov from Russia, where he sought refuge in 2010. The Deputy Head of the Interior Ministry's Chief Directorate for the Enforcement of Punishments - which has responsibility for prisons - refused to discuss the situation of these prisoners of conscience with Forum 18.

The future?

Uzbekistan under both its unelected Presidents since independence systematically violates intertwined fundamental rights - such as freedom of religion and belief, of expression and of assembly, and to be free of torture - it has solemnly undertaken to uphold. Indeed, the interlocking nature of these human rights violations appear designed to impose total state control on all of society.

State officials repeatedly deny that human rights violations take place. Without fundamental changes in the attitudes and actions of officials - especially genuine independently verifiable implementation of the state's human rights obligations - Uzbekistan is likely to remain a place where fundamental human rights are violated with impunity.

67,67,"Why Tonganoxie residents should be worried about a new Tyson Foods poultry plant

Many residents in Tonganoxie -- and tens of thousands of people across the region -- are deeply worried about newly announced plans to build a massive food processing plant in northeast Kansas.

They're right to be concerned.

The project was developed secretly. The builder, Tyson Foods Inc., has a checkered environmental record.

Kansas should slow this process down until critical issues are addressed. If they aren't, the plan should be scrapped.

Tyson officials revealed the $320 million proposal Tuesday, joined by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and local politicians. ""This is a great project,"" Brownback said.

But hundreds of residents crowded into meetings this week to bitterly denounce the plan.

The factory will create about 1,600 jobs. That sounds like good news on its face, but what does that mean for local schools? Truck traffic? Water and sewer service? Residents' safety?

And what damage might the plant do to the air and water?

Tyson's record in this realm is unsettling.

In April 2013, Tyson agreed to pay the federal government $3.95 million for violations of the Clean Air Act in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa -- the four states that comprise Region 7 of the Environmental Protection Agency.

The violations involved eight different leaks of anhydrous ammonia, a poisonous gas. In 2006, a Tyson worker was killed as a result of one such leak in South Hutchinson, Kan. A similar leak in a Tyson plant in Omaha forced the evacuation of 475 employees.

There's more. In 2003, Tyson pleaded guilty in federal court to 20 felony violations of the Clean Water Act. The company admitted it illegally disposed of wastewater at its Sedalia, Mo., plant over several years.

The improper disposal continued ""in spite of the company's assurances that the discharges would stop and even after numerous warnings, administrative orders, two state court injunctions, and the execution of a federal search warrant at the Sedalia facility,"" the Department of Justice said.

Tyson paid a $7.5 million fine in that case. Ancient history? No. ""The company has a staggering water pollution footprint,"" the Environment America Research and Policy Center concluded just last year.

In a statement late Thursday, a Tyson spokesman said the company is not perfect.

""We acknowledge that,"" wrote Worth Sparkman of Tyson. ""But we continue to improve in all areas of our operations, especially in environmental matters.""

Kansans might feel better if they thought the government would protect their health once the plant opens. Alas, Brownback's lust for jobs appears to exceed any real concern for a regulatory safety net.

And the EPA? This week, we reported on the appointment of Cathy Stepp as acting administrator for the Region 7 office here. Stepp's pro-business, pro-polluter record is clear -- and a serious cause for concern.

Tyson, in fact, may have little to fear from Stepp's EPA once the plant is up and operating. That's precisely why her appointment is so troubling.

This isn't just about Tonganoxie. Increased chicken farming in northeast Kansas could mean more fecal and fertilizer runoff into the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, where millions of residents get their water.

Kansans worried about the Tyson plant are right to demand answers before the plant proceeds.

We agree with them: Don't build this factory unless everyone is sure it's safe.

Over the past year, several polls have asked Kansans if they support Medicaid expansion in the state, and all of them have demonstrated widespread support. Last October, a Fort Hays State University survey revealed that 62 percent of respondents were in favor of expansion. A few months later, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network asked Kansans the same question, and reported even greater support: 82 percent. In April, the same organization (along with the American Heart Association) found that 66 percent of Republicans endorsed expansion.

If these polls didn't make Kansans' priorities clear, the crowds of people at the Statehouse should have done so. When lawmakers held hearings on expansion, more than 160 advocates, health care providers, business leaders and concerned citizens testified in favor of providing Medicaid to 150,000 of their fellow Kansans. The opposition, on the other hand, was sparse: only five people showed up. When lawmakers voted on expansion shortly thereafter, they demonstrated that they took their constituents' wishes seriously: the tally was 81-44 in the House and 25-14 in the Senate. But they couldn't override Gov. Sam Brownback's veto.

Medicaid is one of the issues that should remind the rest of the country that Kansas isn't the politically homogeneous state it's often made out to be. Kansans know their governor has given up hundreds of millions of federal Medicaid dollars (the Kansas Hospital Association estimates that the total is around $2 billion). They know they live in one of only 19 states that refused expansion. They know expansion would put health care providers -- particularly vulnerable rural hospitals -- in a much stronger financial position.

Kansans also know that the economic impact of Medicaid expansion isn't as straightforward as critics like Brownback would have them believe. This is why business owners, chambers of commerce and economic organizations across the state have declared their support for expansion. A 2013 brief by the Kaiser Family Foundation ""assessed specific findings from 32 studies in 26 states"" and found that expansion increased ""state output, Gross State Product (GSP) and state and local revenues."" KFF also reported that the studies demonstrated a ""positive effect on jobs and earnings.""

The gubernatorial race offers Kansans an opportunity to reiterate these points. While Democratic candidates are almost unanimously in favor of Medicaid expansion, there are divisions among Republicans. For example, Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer and former state senator Jim Barnett are both physicians, but they disagree on expansion -- Colyer has been resolute in his opposition, while Barnett argues that eligibility should be broadened. Secretary of State Kris Kobach, Ken Selzer and Wink Hartman all oppose expansion, while Ed O'Malley says his support is contingent on whether expansion would be cost-neutral (and if the federal government pulls out, he wants Kansas to do the same).

Bob Beatty is a political scientist at Washburn University, and he points out the significance of this diversity of opinion: ""Where the candidates stand on Medicaid expansion may be one of the key differentiating factors in this primary."" This would be a healthy development. Considering its significance for 150,000 Kansans -- as well as hospitals and businesses around the state -- Medicaid should be a major issue during this campaign. We should demand robust debate, and we can't allow candidates to obscure the facts (for example, those who oppose expansion often cite its costs and ignore the economic benefits mentioned above).

Kansans support Medicaid expansion, and we need to remind our future governor of this fact.

A summer of uprisings heat up Kansas prison system's problems

We want a prison system to be a quiet part of state government. House inmates convicted of serious crimes, keep them safe and obedient while incarcerated, and begin a road of rehabilitation before their releases.

That's not what we're getting from the Kansas Department of Corrections. It's been a summer of heated uprisings that signal chronic problems in need of attention from the legislature.

Kansas' prison system is broken. Inmate crowding at some facilities is made worse by a shortage of corrections officers. Guards are underpaid and many leave for other careers, or even county jails that pay better. At least four major disturbances this summer - at two prisons - have called attention to the growing problem.

The latest uprising came Tuesday night at Norton Correctional Facility in northwest Kansas. It's normally a prison for medium- and minimum-security inmates.

What was described as an ""inmate disturbance"" by a Department of Corrections spokesman was termed a ""full-blown riot"" by a corrections officer who didn't want to be named in a McClatchy Newspapers story.

Maximum-security inmates were moved to Norton because of construction at Lansing Correctional Facility. They were unhappy to be at Norton and so far away from their families.

Inmates started four fires, took over prison offices, destroyed computers and even tipped over a medical response vehicle. The corrections officer estimates prisoners had control of the facility for about three hours. State troopers and corrections officers from three other prisons in central and western Kansas were called in to help.

On Wednesday, a Corrections spokesman said 90 Norton inmates who pose a ""security challenge"" would be transferred - many to Lansing.

A Lansing prison employee told McClatchy Newspapers that some maximum-security inmates were moved to medium security to accommodate the new inmates. So the solution to the Norton problem is to create the same problem at Lansing.

There are other issues. Guard retention became such a problem this summer at El Dorado that Gov. Sam Brownback traveled to the prison to announce immediate 10-percent pay increases for guards there. While a good public first step in easing the problem until the legislature convenes in January, it created yet another problem: Guards at other Kansas prisons didn't receive the same pay increase.

It's easy for most Kansans to read headlines about the state prison system and move on. They've never committed a crime, they're not planning on committing one, and it's someone else's problem.

But it does affect your neighbor, who's a prison guard. Or your friend's brother, who is incarcerated and wants to finish his sentence quietly and safely. These people are in harm's way of unruly inmates and can be victims of poor decision-making by prison officials.

Lawmakers know they can't afford to look the other way when the 2018 legislative session begins. There will be many challenges when they reconvene, and a failing prison system is quickly making its way up the to-do list.

It's not just about the system and how it's run. There are more than 9,000 Kansas inmates, but many are in prison for non-violent crimes such as drug offenses. These are offenses that, in some cases, could be handled without prison time and instead with rehabilitation and monitoring. That would ease prison crowding and alleviate some of the staffing problems seen this summer at El Dorado and Lansing correctional facilities.

The entire system needs scrutiny even before January's legislative session. Hearings need to begin as soon as the session begins. A Department of Corrections without news until then would be a relief."

Lawmakers know they can't afford to look the other way when the 2018 legislative session begins. There will be many challenges when they reconvene, and a failing prison system is quickly making its way up the to-do list.

It's not just about the system and how it's run. There are more than 9,000 Kansas inmates, but many are in prison for non-violent crimes such as drug offenses. These are offenses that, in some cases, could be handled without prison time and instead with rehabilitation and monitoring. That would ease prison crowding and alleviate some of the staffing problems seen this summer at El Dorado and Lansing correctional facilities.

The entire system needs scrutiny even before January's legislative session. Hearings need to begin as soon as the session begins. A Department of Corrections without news until then would be a relief."
69,69,"Why Tonganoxie residents should be worried about a new Tyson Foods poultry plant

Many residents in Tonganoxie -- and tens of thousands of people across the region -- are deeply worried about newly announced plans to build a massive food processing plant in northeast Kansas.

They're right to be concerned.

The project was developed secretly. The builder, Tyson Foods Inc., has a checkered environmental record.

Kansas should slow this process down until critical issues are addressed. If they aren't, the plan should be scrapped.

Tyson officials revealed the $320 million proposal Tuesday, joined by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and local politicians. ""This is a great project,"" Brownback said.

But hundreds of residents crowded into meetings this week to bitterly denounce the plan.

The factory will create about 1,600 jobs. That sounds like good news on its face, but what does that mean for local schools? Truck traffic? Water and sewer service? Residents' safety?

And what damage might the plant do to the air and water?

Tyson's record in this realm is unsettling.

In April 2013, Tyson agreed to pay the federal government $3.95 million for violations of the Clean Air Act in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa -- the four states that comprise Region 7 of the Environmental Protection Agency.

The violations involved eight different leaks of anhydrous ammonia, a poisonous gas. In 2006, a Tyson worker was killed as a result of one such leak in South Hutchinson, Kan. A similar leak in a Tyson plant in Omaha forced the evacuation of 475 employees.

There's more. In 2003, Tyson pleaded guilty in federal court to 20 felony violations of the Clean Water Act. The company admitted it illegally disposed of wastewater at its Sedalia, Mo., plant over several years.

The improper disposal continued ""in spite of the company's assurances that the discharges would stop and even after numerous warnings, administrative orders, two state court injunctions, and the execution of a federal search warrant at the Sedalia facility,"" the Department of Justice said.

Tyson paid a $7.5 million fine in that case. Ancient history? No. ""The company has a staggering water pollution footprint,"" the Environment America Research and Policy Center concluded just last year.

In a statement late Thursday, a Tyson spokesman said the company is not perfect.

""We acknowledge that,"" wrote Worth Sparkman of Tyson. ""But we continue to improve in all areas of our operations, especially in environmental matters.""

Kansans might feel better if they thought the government would protect their health once the plant opens. Alas, Brownback's lust for jobs appears to exceed any real concern for a regulatory safety net.

And the EPA? This week, we reported on the appointment of Cathy Stepp as acting administrator for the Region 7 office here. Stepp's pro-business, pro-polluter record is clear -- and a serious cause for concern.

Tyson, in fact, may have little to fear from Stepp's EPA once the plant is up and operating. That's precisely why her appointment is so troubling.

This isn't just about Tonganoxie. Increased chicken farming in northeast Kansas could mean more fecal and fertilizer runoff into the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, where millions of residents get their water.

Kansans worried about the Tyson plant are right to demand answers before the plant proceeds.

We agree with them: Don't build this factory unless everyone is sure it's safe.

Over the past year, several polls have asked Kansans if they support Medicaid expansion in the state, and all of them have demonstrated widespread support. Last October, a Fort Hays State University survey revealed that 62 percent of respondents were in favor of expansion. A few months later, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network asked Kansans the same question, and reported even greater support: 82 percent. In April, the same organization (along with the American Heart Association) found that 66 percent of Republicans endorsed expansion.

If these polls didn't make Kansans' priorities clear, the crowds of people at the Statehouse should have done so. When lawmakers held hearings on expansion, more than 160 advocates, health care providers, business leaders and concerned citizens testified in favor of providing Medicaid to 150,000 of their fellow Kansans. The opposition, on the other hand, was sparse: only five people showed up. When lawmakers voted on expansion shortly thereafter, they demonstrated that they took their constituents' wishes seriously: the tally was 81-44 in the House and 25-14 in the Senate. But they couldn't override Gov. Sam Brownback's veto.

Medicaid is one of the issues that should remind the rest of the country that Kansas isn't the politically homogeneous state it's often made out to be. Kansans know their governor has given up hundreds of millions of federal Medicaid dollars (the Kansas Hospital Association estimates that the total is around $2 billion). They know they live in one of only 19 states that refused expansion. They know expansion would put health care providers -- particularly vulnerable rural hospitals -- in a much stronger financial position.

Kansans also know that the economic impact of Medicaid expansion isn't as straightforward as critics like Brownback would have them believe. This is why business owners, chambers of commerce and economic organizations across the state have declared their support for expansion. A 2013 brief by the Kaiser Family Foundation ""assessed specific findings from 32 studies in 26 states"" and found that expansion increased ""state output, Gross State Product (GSP) and state and local revenues."" KFF also reported that the studies demonstrated a ""positive effect on jobs and earnings.""

The gubernatorial race offers Kansans an opportunity to reiterate these points. While Democratic candidates are almost unanimously in favor of Medicaid expansion, there are divisions among Republicans. For example, Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer and former state senator Jim Barnett are both physicians, but they disagree on expansion -- Colyer has been resolute in his opposition, while Barnett argues that eligibility should be broadened. Secretary of State Kris Kobach, Ken Selzer and Wink Hartman all oppose expansion, while Ed O'Malley says his support is contingent on whether expansion would be cost-neutral (and if the federal government pulls out, he wants Kansas to do the same).

Bob Beatty is a political scientist at Washburn University, and he points out the significance of this diversity of opinion: ""Where the candidates stand on Medicaid expansion may be one of the key differentiating factors in this primary."" This would be a healthy development. Considering its significance for 150,000 Kansans -- as well as hospitals and businesses around the state -- Medicaid should be a major issue during this campaign. We should demand robust debate, and we can't allow candidates to obscure the facts (for example, those who oppose expansion often cite its costs and ignore the economic benefits mentioned above).

Kansans support Medicaid expansion, and we need to remind our future governor of this fact.

A summer of uprisings heat up Kansas prison system's problems

We want a prison system to be a quiet part of state government. House inmates convicted of serious crimes, keep them safe and obedient while incarcerated, and begin a road of rehabilitation before their releases.

That's not what we're getting from the Kansas Department of Corrections. It's been a summer of heated uprisings that signal chronic problems in need of attention from the legislature.

Kansas' prison system is broken. Inmate crowding at some facilities is made worse by a shortage of corrections officers. Guards are underpaid and many leave for other careers, or even county jails that pay better. At least four major disturbances this summer - at two prisons - have called attention to the growing problem.

The latest uprising came Tuesday night at Norton Correctional Facility in northwest Kansas. It's normally a prison for medium- and minimum-security inmates.

What was described as an ""inmate disturbance"" by a Department of Corrections spokesman was termed a ""full-blown riot"" by a corrections officer who didn't want to be named in a McClatchy Newspapers story.

Maximum-security inmates were moved to Norton because of construction at Lansing Correctional Facility. They were unhappy to be at Norton and so far away from their families.

Inmates started four fires, took over prison offices, destroyed computers and even tipped over a medical response vehicle. The corrections officer estimates prisoners had control of the facility for about three hours. State troopers and corrections officers from three other prisons in central and western Kansas were called in to help.

On Wednesday, a Corrections spokesman said 90 Norton inmates who pose a ""security challenge"" would be transferred - many to Lansing.

A Lansing prison employee told McClatchy Newspapers that some maximum-security inmates were moved to medium security to accommodate the new inmates. So the solution to the Norton problem is to create the same problem at Lansing.

There are other issues. Guard retention became such a problem this summer at El Dorado that Gov. Sam Brownback traveled to the prison to announce immediate 10-percent pay increases for guards there. While a good public first step in easing the problem until the legislature convenes in January, it created yet another problem: Guards at other Kansas prisons didn't receive the same pay increase.

It's easy for most Kansans to read headlines about the state prison system and move on. They've never committed a crime, they're not planning on committing one, and it's someone else's problem.

But it does affect your neighbor, who's a prison guard. Or your friend's brother, who is incarcerated and wants to finish his sentence quietly and safely. These people are in harm's way of unruly inmates and can be victims of poor decision-making by prison officials.

Lawmakers know they can't afford to look the other way when the 2018 legislative session begins. There will be many challenges when they reconvene, and a failing prison system is quickly making its way up the to-do list.

A few months later, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network asked Kansans the same question, and reported even greater support: 82 percent. In April, the same organization (along with the American Heart Association) found that 66 percent of Republicans endorsed expansion.

If these polls didn't make Kansans' priorities clear, the crowds of people at the Statehouse should have done so. When lawmakers held hearings on expansion, more than 160 advocates, health care providers, business leaders and concerned citizens testified in favor of providing Medicaid to 150,000 of their fellow Kansans. The opposition, on the other hand, was sparse: only five people showed up. When lawmakers voted on expansion shortly thereafter, they demonstrated that they took their constituents' wishes seriously: the tally was 81-44 in the House and 25-14 in the Senate. But they couldn't override Gov. Sam Brownback's veto.

Medicaid is one of the issues that should remind the rest of the country that Kansas isn't the politically homogeneous state it's often made out to be. Kansans know their governor has given up hundreds of millions of federal Medicaid dollars (the Kansas Hospital Association estimates that the total is around $2 billion). They know they live in one of only 19 states that refused expansion. They know expansion would put health care providers -- particularly vulnerable rural hospitals -- in a much stronger financial position.

Kansans also know that the economic impact of Medicaid expansion isn't as straightforward as critics like Brownback would have them believe. This is why business owners, chambers of commerce and economic organizations across the state have declared their support for expansion. A 2013 brief by the Kaiser Family Foundation ""assessed specific findings from 32 studies in 26 states"" and found that expansion increased ""state output, Gross State Product (GSP) and state and local revenues."" KFF also reported that the studies demonstrated a ""positive effect on jobs and earnings.""

The gubernatorial race offers Kansans an opportunity to reiterate these points. While Democratic candidates are almost unanimously in favor of Medicaid expansion, there are divisions among Republicans. For example, Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer and former state senator Jim Barnett are both physicians, but they disagree on expansion -- Colyer has been resolute in his opposition, while Barnett argues that eligibility should be broadened. Secretary of State Kris Kobach, Ken Selzer and Wink Hartman all oppose expansion, while Ed O'Malley says his support is contingent on whether expansion would be cost-neutral (and if the federal government pulls out, he wants Kansas to do the same).

Bob Beatty is a political scientist at Washburn University, and he points out the significance of this diversity of opinion: ""Where the candidates stand on Medicaid expansion may be one of the key differentiating factors in this primary."" This would be a healthy development. Considering its significance for 150,000 Kansans -- as well as hospitals and businesses around the state -- Medicaid should be a major issue during this campaign. We should demand robust debate, and we can't allow candidates to obscure the facts (for example, those who oppose expansion often cite its costs and ignore the economic benefits mentioned above).

Kansans support Medicaid expansion, and we need to remind our future governor of this fact.

A summer of uprisings heat up Kansas prison system's problems

We want a prison system to be a quiet part of state government. House inmates convicted of serious crimes, keep them safe and obedient while incarcerated, and begin a road of rehabilitation before their releases.

That's not what we're getting from the Kansas Department of Corrections. It's been a summer of heated uprisings that signal chronic problems in need of attention from the legislature.

Kansas' prison system is broken. Inmate crowding at some facilities is made worse by a shortage of corrections officers. Guards are underpaid and many leave for other careers, or even county jails that pay better. At least four major disturbances this summer - at two prisons - have called attention to the growing problem.

The latest uprising came Tuesday night at Norton Correctional Facility in northwest Kansas. It's normally a prison for medium- and minimum-security inmates.

What was described as an ""inmate disturbance"" by a Department of Corrections spokesman was termed a ""full-blown riot"" by a corrections officer who didn't want to be named in a McClatchy Newspapers story.

Maximum-security inmates were moved to Norton because of construction at Lansing Correctional Facility. They were unhappy to be at Norton and so far away from their families.

Inmates started four fires, took over prison offices, destroyed computers and even tipped over a medical response vehicle. The corrections officer estimates prisoners had control of the facility for about three hours. State troopers and corrections officers from three other prisons in central and western Kansas were called in to help.

On Wednesday, a Corrections spokesman said 90 Norton inmates who pose a ""security challenge"" would be transferred - many to Lansing.

A Lansing prison employee told McClatchy Newspapers that some maximum-security inmates were moved to medium security to accommodate the new inmates. So the solution to the Norton problem is to create the same problem at Lansing.

There are other issues. Guard retention became such a problem this summer at El Dorado that Gov. Sam Brownback traveled to the prison to announce immediate 10-percent pay increases for guards there. While a good public first step in easing the problem until the legislature convenes in January, it created yet another problem: Guards at other Kansas prisons didn't receive the same pay increase.

It's easy for most Kansans to read headlines about the state prison system and move on. They've never committed a crime, they're not planning on committing one, and it's someone else's problem.

But it does affect your neighbor, who's a prison guard. Or your friend's brother, who is incarcerated and wants to finish his sentence quietly and safely. These people are in harm's way of unruly inmates and can be victims of poor decision-making by prison officials.

Lawmakers know they can't afford to look the other way when the 2018 legislative session begins. There will be many challenges when they reconvene, and a failing prison system is quickly making its way up the to-do list.

It's not just about the system and how it's run. There are more than 9,000 Kansas inmates, but many are in prison for non-violent crimes such as drug offenses. These are offenses that, in some cases, could be handled without prison time and instead with rehabilitation and monitoring. That would ease prison crowding and alleviate some of the staffing problems seen this summer at El Dorado and Lansing correctional facilities.

The entire system needs scrutiny even before January's legislative session. Hearings need to begin as soon as the session begins. A Department of Corrections without news until then would be a relief."
73,73,"Why Tonganoxie residents should be worried about a new Tyson Foods poultry plant

Many residents in Tonganoxie -- and tens of thousands of people across the region -- are deeply worried about newly announced plans to build a massive food processing plant in northeast Kansas.

They're right to be concerned.

The project was developed secretly. The builder, Tyson Foods Inc., has a checkered environmental record.

Kansas should slow this process down until critical issues are addressed. If they aren't, the plan should be scrapped.

Tyson officials revealed the $320 million proposal Tuesday, joined by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and local politicians. ""This is a great project,"" Brownback said.

But hundreds of residents crowded into meetings this week to bitterly denounce the plan.

The factory will create about 1,600 jobs. That sounds like good news on its face, but what does that mean for local schools? Truck traffic? Water and sewer service? Residents' safety?

And what damage might the plant do to the air and water?

Tyson's record in this realm is unsettling.

In April 2013, Tyson agreed to pay the federal government $3.95 million for violations of the Clean Air Act in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa -- the four states that comprise Region 7 of the Environmental Protection Agency.

The violations involved eight different leaks of anhydrous ammonia, a poisonous gas. In 2006, a Tyson worker was killed as a result of one such leak in South Hutchinson, Kan. A similar leak in a Tyson plant in Omaha forced the evacuation of 475 employees.

There's more. In 2003, Tyson pleaded guilty in federal court to 20 felony violations of the Clean Water Act. The company admitted it illegally disposed of wastewater at its Sedalia, Mo., plant over several years.

The improper disposal continued ""in spite of the company's assurances that the discharges would stop and even after numerous warnings, administrative orders, two state court injunctions, and the execution of a federal search warrant at the Sedalia facility,"" the Department of Justice said.

Tyson paid a $7.5 million fine in that case. Ancient history? No. ""The company has a staggering water pollution footprint,"" the Environment America Research and Policy Center concluded just last year.

In a statement late Thursday, a Tyson spokesman said the company is not perfect.

""We acknowledge that,"" wrote Worth Sparkman of Tyson. ""But we continue to improve in all areas of our operations, especially in environmental matters.""

Kansans might feel better if they thought the government would protect their health once the plant opens. Alas, Brownback's lust for jobs appears to exceed any real concern for a regulatory safety net.

And the EPA? This week, we reported on the appointment of Cathy Stepp as acting administrator for the Region 7 office here. Stepp's pro-business, pro-polluter record is clear -- and a serious cause for concern.

Tyson, in fact, may have little to fear from Stepp's EPA once the plant is up and operating. That's precisely why her appointment is so troubling.

This isn't just about Tonganoxie. Increased chicken farming in northeast Kansas could mean more fecal and fertilizer runoff into the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, where millions of residents get their water.

Kansans worried about the Tyson plant are right to demand answers before the plant proceeds.

We agree with them: Don't build this factory unless everyone is sure it's safe.

Over the past year, several polls have asked Kansans if they support Medicaid expansion in the state, and all of them have demonstrated widespread support.

A family who live 'off-grid' have revealed that they have been kicked out of their home after people complained about them.

Adele and Matt Allen believe in a natural upbringing and appeared on This Morning where they didn't react when their daughter urinated on the floor.

They have shunned modern medicine, Adele continued to breastfeed their five-year-old son, and they planned to home school.

However, Adele has posted a message on Facebook revealing they are being kicked out.

She wrote: 'So we are being evicted due to certain resident's concerns over their insurance and our pushchair occasionally drying out in the hallway so it doesn't cause damp in our small flat.....the line here about insurance rings so true in this incidence.'

On it she posted a picture of a page from a book that included the line: 'How to you get them to buy insurance? By making them worry about everything.'

Neighbour Philip Bull told MailOnline: 'The kids seem like a handful but they look well cared for and happy.

'The family has the garden flat in the house and I've been told it is a right state, a mess. I was told they all live in the same room which seems a bit strange.

'I don't know who the landlord is but I was told he'd had enough of them not obeying house rules. Doors were left open, there was rubbish and bottles left out. It was a state.

When their two children, Ulysses and Ostara, were born, their umbilical cords were left to fall off naturally, in what is known as a 'lotus birth'.

The couple from Brighton use the controversial 'Off-Grid Parenting' style.

Adele, a writer, said: 'Off-grid is moving towards self sustainability and being a bit more free range and less institutionalised.'

Matt said: 'We did collect a lot of information but essentially it was just this feeling.'

Adele gave birth to both her children with no medical intervention and unassisted apart from having her husband Matt by her side.

She said: 'The thought of giving birth in a hospital just didn't appeal to me because of many reasons - mostly the observer effect.

'Also, the interventions I think can be gently nudged on you when you are in a very vulnerable state.'

Adele and Matt also decided to have 'lotus births', meaning the placenta and umbilical cords were not surgically removed at birth.

Instead, Adele carried the attached placenta in a cool bag - scattered with salt and rose petals to help to dry the placenta and disguise any smell, around with her until it fell off naturally.

She said: 'With both my births it took six days for the umbilical cord to fall away naturally.

'You wrap it up and keep it clean and it falls away and forms a perfect belly button.

'In my knowledge, it's perfectly safe and it worked beautifully for us. I don't know of any known cases where it's gone wrong.

'I very much honour the postpartum-period and I didn't go out at all during that first week. So it was just a matter of transporting it to the toilet or to the kitchen.'

Adele feels very strongly about full-term breastfeeding and her five-year-son still regularly feeds from Adele for comfort.

She said: 'Ulysses does still nurse from time to time. Since the baby came along it has decreased rapidly and we had to come to a mutual understanding that it needed to graduate down a bit, but then I wasn't willing to say, ""no you need to stop now"".

'I think it's up to him to decide when he wants to move on from it. It's something that's just as natural as a hug is, it's a connection.'

Aside from a hospital trip with Ulysses following an asthma attack, the Allen children have never seen a doctor or received vaccinations.

Adele said: 'I don't really see that there's any need other than using breastfeeding to supplement them.

'I don't see any need to inject any foreign substance directly into the blood stream. That's not how children will come into the contact with a germ naturally anyway, be it in the mouth or another way.'

Distrusting of modern medicine, Adele prefers to treat her youngsters' ailments naturally, using breast milk in their eyes to cure eye infections and serving them lemon juice when they have a cold.

She said: 'If you use plants and herbs you target the bad without attacking the good bacteria as well.

'If I had something serious like cancer, I would definitely take the natural path. I wholeheartedly have faith in it now and I've experienced enough of it to know that is the way forward.

'The kids' health is just as important as mine if not more so, and so again I would go with what I trust and for me, that is the natural path.'

Adele and Matt also believe in attachment parenting methods, such as co-sleeping, and the family of four all sleep in the same room.

Adele said: 'It works quite nicely for us. Normally we put the baby down to sleep first. Uly pretty much picks up his own bed time, but as we don't have a school routine in morning he is then able to wake up when it suits him.'

Ostara and Ulysses do not attend mainstream school and instead spend their days outside among nature, learning about plants.

The mum-of-two said: 'We basically spend lots of time in nature. It's more important to us for them to interact with animals and plants and learn about the environment than it is for them to have big sets of plastic toys.

'Ostara really likes to play with woodlice and in the mud. In the park, there's a big herb patch and she likes to pick and eat the mint leaves. Already at this young age she is thinking about what she can pick from nature and eat.'

The parents accept that reading and writing are imperative life skills but do not want learning to be forced upon their children and five-year-old Ulysses can only recognise basic letters and numbers.

Adele said: 'I don't have an issue with that. There is no need for him to be able to read and write at this age anyway.'

Instead, Adele and Matt believe that Ulysses and Ostara are becoming curious about letters and numbers from seeing them out and about.

Adele said: 'They see letters on drain covers and numbers on signs and then learning happens as a consequence of just being out in the world, rather than it being forced upon them in a classroom that is not particularly inspiring.'

The parents don't worry that their non-traditional schooling will affect the children's future.

Adele said: 'I think home school kids are very successful entrepreneurs normally because they have been educated in that way that, they do want to build their own business and not to be a slave to someone else.'

Despite spending most of their time outdoors, Adele and Matt have decided not to smother their children in suncream the way parents are usually inclined to do.

Adele said: 'We don't use sun cream. Not at all on the kids. We don't believe it protects you from cancer.

Adele writes a blog on natural parenting and she and Matt are adamant, despite some negative comments, they would not raise their children any other way.

Matt said: 'The whole process of doing it in a completely different way has been an amazing journey and a learning curve for all parties involved.

'I have got such a fantastic connection and bond with both of them and they know who we are - more than just being Mum and Dada - it's a much deeper connection than that.'

The family are currently saving to migrate to Costa Rica, to live an eco-lifestyle.

Adele said: 'Our ultimate ambition is to move towards self-sustainability. We're looking at Central America; somewhere we can get a big plot of land and grow food. Have the space for freedom and access to wildlife in its natural state.'

75,75,"In 2013, the United States ceded the supercomputing crown to China, whose Sunway TaihuLight machine is over five times as powerful as the U.S. government's fastest system, called Titan. But the Department of Energy is working on a new generation of supercomputers that are 50 times faster than Titan -- a performance boost described as ""exascale."" Today, DoE awarded $258 million in contracts to six U.S. companies -- AMD, Cray (maker of Titan), Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Intel, and Nvidia -- to build an exascale system by 2021. The companies themselves are expected to add at least $172 million of their own funding to the project, since they will also benefit from the new technologies developed.

Technological contributions to the Exascale Computing Project will vary. In the first phase, companies will be designing technologies that could potentially be used in a future system, says Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). It will be pushing a new computer architecture that keeps data in monstrous amounts of superfast RAM where it can be worked on all at once, rather than shuttling it to and from slower hard drives. This pool of data will be a ""fabric"" linking processors that work on the data. HPE introduced a prototype of this technology, called The Machine last month.

That memory-oriented approach seems to jibe with IBM's philosophy. ""High performance computing is shifting from a purely compute-centric model to one that is much more data-centric,"" writes James Sexton of IBM Research in an email to Fast Company. ""The ability to manage, train, sort and analyze the data 'where it resides' and 'as it flows' through the system is critical to gaining insight quickly from the plethora of data sources vs. traditional [computing methods].""

Nvidia's contribution will be more-powerful graphics processing units for artificial intelligence -- a generation or more beyond the new Volta chips going into DoE computers already slated for 2018. Beyond the hardware, DoE is also charging the companies to write powerful software to run the monstrous calculations.

You'd be forgiven for not grasping what the performance goal of 1,000 petaflop/s (quadrillions of calculations per second) means for real-world applications. DoE lists plenty of potential examples, such as simulating the effects of earthquakes, predicting the effectiveness of cancer treatments, designing nuclear fusion reactors, and modeling the aerodynamics of giant wind farms. An April 2017 DoE presentation on phenomena that the system can model even includes the words ""climate change"" -- once in a 30-page document.

One of the Exascale Computing Project's green goals is to boost performance without requiring more energy. But even if DoE succeeds, it will still have a pretty high electric bill. The best-case scenario is a system that consumes 20 megawatts, enough to power about 20,000 homes."
76,76,"Over the last few weeks in this column, I have written some pieces on how the ""cognitive"" functions in Artificial Intelligence (AI) would be dead on arrival without correct, contextually labelled data. The first dealt with teaching AI machines common sense, which is a non-trivial undertaking. The second was a complex piece which dealt with how these data needed to be analysed with the use of deep science so that they can be used in the world of medical AI. Last week's piece dwelled on how this labelling of data, from the mundane to the arduous, will create a large employment opportunity for humans in the Intelligent Age.

For many years, the pioneers of AI stuck to an approach where they tried to capture the best of human ""expert"" brains to create heuristics -- or rules of thumb -- that could act as grounds-up reference points for traditionally built computer systems to use. Many of these heuristics were codified using frameworks which rely heavily on the cognitive psychology behind how humans think and learn. I have spoken of CREDO, an attempt to codify such knowledge using human cognitive psychology which was created by John Fox, a professor of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. Also, earlier in my career, I worked for a firm that was focused on this sort of AI, and the importance of handcrafting and curating such knowledge stores of heuristics was paramount.

Traditional software development has become notoriously expensive and labour intensive. Managers and marketers who are responsible for procuring and selling software products and services are attracted by ""machine learning"", the idea that future computer systems will ""program"" themselves: learning how to carry out tasks and progressively improving their performance through ""experience"" without the need for human intervention.

My opinion is that this level of faith in a soulless, repetitive machine is puerile; nonetheless, I will concede that there have been instances where churning through reams of data has allowed computers to make some connections on their own. But these connections are yet unequal to the task -- and can only get better when they use a hybrid of both the top down approach of traditional AI and the ocean-churning approach of machine learning. This hybrid approach can be likened to the turbo charged motor car -- where the fuel is the set of heuristics or expert knowledge which when fed into computer programmes give off a data exhaust which can then be re-harnessed and added to the fuel to turbocharge the computer's motor. Starting without the heuristics is like starting a motor car without fuel.

The froth ensuing from marketing departments at some of these AI firms was unfortunately allowed to take over the messaging about machine learning to the public. A few years on, it has become painfully apparent that many of these marketers' tall promises were damp squibs. IBM, for instance, has faced harsh criticism from some sections of the fourth estate in the last few months. Many articles lambast the claims that the firm's marketing department has made about the medical capabilities of its Watson product. This disenchantment is also seen among the medical community. My brother-in-law, a professor of medicine at one of America's well-known universities, and another old friend and classmate, a practising surgical oncologist in Florida, would just a few years ago opine that Watson would save the world by providing pinpoint diagnostic accuracy, and would rid the world of cancer. They were swayed enough by the marketing to tell the doubting Thomas in me to pipe down when I pointed out what I felt were the limitations of a top-down machine learning approach. Both these doctors are now a lot more circumspect when they discuss the impact of AI in medicine. It appears that these physicians are as gullible as you and I are, but at least they are willing to revise their hypotheses when presented with new information.

STATnews, a publication focused on stories about health, medicine, and scientific discovery, is widely read by doctors and has recently published a scathing article on IBM's Watson, which no doubt contributed to my classmate and my brother-in-law's change of heart. STAT takes its name from medical parlance. The command ""stat"" is barked out by doctors to their underlings when they want something urgent done immediately.

The STATnews article doesn't mince words. The publication alleges that the interviews it conducted suggest that IBM, in its rush to bolster flagging revenue, unleashed a product without fully assessing the difficulties of deploying it in hospitals globally. It further alleges that IBM has not published any scientific papers demonstrating how the technology affects physicians and patients. As a result, says the publication, Watson's flaws are getting exposed on the front lines of care by doctors who say that the product, while promising in some respects, remains undeveloped. The piece quotes a South Korean cancer specialist who has used the product, who says ""Watson for Oncology is in their toddler stage, and we have to wait and actively engage, hopefully to help them grow healthy."" If machine learning systems must in fact start as toddlers, then we need to turn to traditional educators like Fox to train them in the hybrid framework I have discussed earlier in this column.

OpenClinical, where Fox is chief scientific officer, is a non-profit foundation which seeks to handcraft machine executable AI knowledge from traditional clinical guidelines and research sources. OpenClinical ""publets"" are accessible in a repository that can be used by medical professionals to create practical services at the point of care.

OpenClinical is now taking the hybrid approach, introducing machine learning to exploit the ""data exhaust"" produced by the point of care services to progressively improve clinical decision-making.

IBM has been teaming with firms and organizations such as these. Its alleged marketing hyperactivity aside, IBM's willingness to use these sorts of methods to make Watson more robust should be lauded and efforts like OpenClinical and its commercial partner, Deontics, need to be encouraged if we are to see computers playing a meaningful role in healthcare."

Magnetic nanoparticles to treat cancer

Currently regarded as a collection of diseases, cancer is most accurately characterised by an unregulated growth of cells within the body. Given that cancer itself is so multifaceted, many therapies are used to combat it. However, offlate the trend has been to use more targeted and personalised therapies in order to specifically target the type of cancer being dealt with. Scientists from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru have come up with another such therapy. This therapy utilises graphene oxide molecules conjugated with magnetic nanoparticles. Graphene nanocomposites can act as a substrate where various specialised drugs can attach, that can then be slowly released in the specific body part harbouring a tumour. In addition, graphene oxide has also been shown to kill cancer cells specifically. What's more, graphene oxide nanocomposites can also be thermally excited by shining near-infrared radiation on them and thus be used to kill tumour cells in a targeted way.

These insects are not only capable of destroying important crops like cotton, but also act as vectors of plant viruses. The precise identification of these insects can help us design effective strategies to control them. In their recent study, scientists from the Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata used DNA barcoding technique to differentiate 89 morphospecies of thrips. This study is the largest ever DNA barcoding effort conducted on thrips! Through the study, the researchers were able to distinguish between closely related species and species complexes. The research contributed 104 novel sequences of 39 morphospecies to the GenBank database, which is a genetic sequence database.

Great asset

When are you really random?

The ability to behave randomly can be a great asset. Think of the mouse trying to outrun a cat -- moving in an erratic, unpredictable way makes it harder to catch. In humans, this sort of behaviour is thought to be linked to creativity and cognitive complexity. But understanding the mind's capacity to produce randomness is difficult. Recently, a team from Europe pitted humans and computers against one another in a series of tasks designed to measure random choice-making. Around age 25, the researchers determined, people are best able to produce a random result. Traditionally, computational tools for studying random behaviour have been limited, according to Hector Zenil, an author of the study, published in PLOS Computational Biology, and a co-leader of the Algorithmic Dynamics Lab at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. His team compiled five tasks of randomness. These included mimicking a series of random coin flips or dice rolls and arranging a grid of black and white boxes to look random. More than 3,400 people participated in the experiment. Measuring how participants performed against several factors, including age, sex and educational background, the researchers found a strong trend only with age. On average, performance improved from childhood to the mid-20s. It then stayed relatively high until the 60s, after which it began to decline. For those over 60, though, there was no need to fret. Not only was the difference between participants aged 25 and those aged 60 relatively small, but there are probably other trade-offs influencing creative capacity, Hector said.

From shockwaves

Origins of cosmic rays

The origin of cosmic rays, high-energy particles from outer space constantly impacting on Earth, is among the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Now, a new study sheds light on the origin of those energetic particles. Discovered more than 100 years ago and considered a potential health risk, cosmic rays are believed to be produced by shock waves. Much of this is seen through Crab Nebula, a known producer of cosmic rays. The new study reveals that the electromagnetic radiation streaming from the Crab Nebula may originate in a different way than traditionally thought. The entire radiation can potentially be unified and arise from a single population of electrons.

Frank Chen's e-commerce business has nothing to do with politics but he worries it might be sunk by the Communist Party's latest effort to control what the Chinese public sees online. Chen's 25-employee company sells clothes and appliances to Americans and Europeans through platforms including Facebook, one of thousands of websites blocked by China's web filters. Chen reaches it using a virtual private network, but that window might be closing after Beijing launched a campaign in January to stamp out use of VPNs to evade its ""Great Firewall.""

""Our entire business might be paralyzed,"" said Chen by phone from the western city of Chengdu. Still, he added later in a text message, ""national policy deserves a positive response and we fully support it."" The crackdown threatens to disrupt work and study for millions of Chinese entrepreneurs, scientists and students who rely on websites they can see only with a VPN. The technology, developed to create secure, encrypted links between computers, allows Chinese web users to see a blocked site by hiding the address from government filters.

Astronomers and physicists use services such as Google Scholar and Dropbox, accessible only via VPN, to share research and stay in touch with foreign colleagues. Merchants use Facebook and other blocked social media to find customers. Students look for material in subjects from history to film editing on YouTube and other blocked sites. Control over information is especially sensitive ahead of October's twice-a-decade ruling party congress at which President Xi Jinping is due to be named to a second five-year term as leader.

The VPN crackdown is part of a campaign to tighten political control that activists say is the most severe since the 1989 suppression of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement. Dozens of activists and lawyers have been detained. A cybersecurity law that took effect in June tightens control on online data. Regulators have stepped up censorship of social media and video websites. How many people might be affected is unclear, but consumer research firm GlobalWebIndex said a survey of Chinese web surfers this year found 14 percent use a VPN daily. If that percentage holds for China's total online population of 731 million, it suggests the country might have as many as 100 million regular users.

Some 8.8 percent of people in the survey use VPNs to look at ""restricted sites,"" according to GlobalWebIndex. That would be equivalent to 65 million people, or the population of Britain. Communist leaders encourage web use for business and education. They want online commerce to help transform China from a low-wage factory into a high-tech consumer society. But they reject the notion of a borderless internet and free flow of information. Chinese web users without VPNs cannot see the most popular global websites including Google and social media such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, as well as news outlets and human rights groups.

In the latest crackdown, regulators say only government-authorized VPNs will be allowed. The operator of a popular service, Green VPN, told customers in June it had been ordered to close. Others shut down without warning. ""You have to leave a window for people, for those who need it,"" said Wen Jian, a securities trader in Beijing. Wen said he needs to find financial information and Google, accessible only with a VPN, is more effective than Chinese search engines. But his VPN quit working two months ago. ""As far as I know, some government people use VPNs too,"" said Wen, 27. ""They read things abroad. Why can they have it and we cannot?""

The crackdown reflects Xi's notion of ""internet sovereignty,"" or Beijing's absolute right to control what people can do and see online. Unauthorized VPNs already were banned but authorities appeared to ignore them, possibly to avoid disrupting business or to defuse resistance among professionals and academics. Government spokespeople refuse to acknowledge any site is blocked, though researchers say they can see attempts to reach sites such as Google stopped within servers operated by state-owned China Telecom Ltd., which controls China's links to the global internet.

But a letter sent by China Telecom to some corporate customers this year offers a hint: It says VPNs can link only to a company's headquarters abroad and no other sites. It warns violators will lose access. (Image Source: AP)

Regulators have yet to say who will be allowed to use government-licensed VPNs or what they can see. But a letter sent by China Telecom to some corporate customers this year offers a hint: It says VPNs can link only to a company's headquarters abroad and no other sites. It warns violators will lose access. Until now, web controls have acted like a tax, allowing users to see blocked sites by paying for a VPN, according to Margaret E. Roberts, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego. ""As VPNs become more difficult to access, it's like the government is raising the tax,"" said Roberts in an email. ""If VPNs were illegal, we would expect a different calculation for those seeking access.""

In a sign of a more severe official stance, a 26-year-old entrepreneur who sold VPN service in Dongguan, near Hong Kong, was sentenced in March to nine months in prison. The agency in charge of the crackdown, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Cabinet press office didn't respond to questions sent by fax and email about what, if anything, the public will be allowed to do with authorized VPNs. Chen, the online merchant, said he heard private companies might be permitted but he has yet to apply.

The economic impact is unclear, but other Chinese data controls already are a drag on business. The European Center for International Political Economy estimated in 2014 curbs in effect or planned could cut economic growth by up to 1.1 percentage points. That would be equal to as much as $130 billion of lost activity in China's $12 trillion-a-year economy.

""I asked some friends, and if a large number of VPNs are banned, then everyone's response is there will be a big impact on their business,"" Chen said.

Chinese leaders faced similar complaints after the ""Great Firewall"" was activated in 2002. It blocked access to Google, prompting an outcry from scientists and businesspeople who needed to find research papers and commercial information. Public complaints have been muted in part because Chinese companies have developed alternatives to popular global services. Instead of Facebook and Twitter, Chinese social media users have WeChat and Sina Weibo. Baidu Inc. provides Google-style search that complies with official censorship.

""I am pretty lazy,"" said Hao Kailin, a landscape designer in Beijing who finds images online for work. ""If it is too much trouble to look for pictures from prohibited websites, then I give up.""

79,79,"THE BIG IDEA: Five deaths related to Hurricane Irma have now been confirmed in Florida. Two of the victims died in a car crash southeast of Tampa on Sunday: A sheriff's deputy had been stationed in an evacuation shelter overnight and was driving home at about 6 a.m. to pick up more supplies. A corrections officer was on his way to work.

Any loss of life is a tragedy, and the death toll is certain to go up, but it's remarkable the extent to which the human cost of a storm as destructive and powerful as this one -- which will cause untold billions in property damage -- can be mitigated.

Forecasting has improved dramatically over the past century, as has the quality of construction. We have a much better idea of who should leave when a massive storm is coming, and they have more time to get out. Government officials of both parties are also more willing to order mandatory evacuations. Finally, better roads and equipment make it easier to extract people in harm's way.

For context, at least 6,000 died when a Category 4 hurricane unexpectedly made landfall in Galveston, Tex., on Sept. 8, 1900. Some estimates put the number of deaths closer to 10,000. With no evacuation from the port town, people were sitting ducks. It remains the deadliest storm in U.S. history.

There are several other storms that may have been less powerful than Irma yet caused vastly more deaths. A storm surge from a 1928 hurricane killed more than 1,800 people around Lake Okeechobee, Fla. Separate hurricanes in 1893 each killed more than 1,000 people.

-- Erik Larson wrote a gripping account of the Galveston hurricane in a 1999 book called ""Isaac's Storm."" The protagonist is Texas's chief weatherman Isaac Monroe Cline, who led the Galveston observation office of the United States Weather Bureau when the storm hit and lost his wife to the storm surge. For a full decade leading up to the devastation, Cline insisted publicly that the idea Galveston could ever be ""seriously damaged"" by a hurricane was ""simply an absurd delusion.""

""It would be impossible for any cyclone to create a storm wave which would materially injure the city,"" Cline wrote in a piece for the Galveston News. That op-ed helped dissuade city fathers from investing in a sea wall that could have saved thousands of lives when the storm came.

Cline was once on his way to Mexico for a work trip when his steamship encountered a low-intensity hurricane. Rather than counting his blessings, the meteorologist concluded (insanely) that hurricanes were more survivable than conventional wisdom depicted.

He believed he was an especially gifted, even brilliant, scientist. But, Larson writes, ""he did not know there was such a thing as the jet stream, or that easterly waves marched from the coast of West Africa every summer, or that a massive flow within the Atlantic Ocean ferried heat around the globe. Nor had he heard of a phenomenon called El Nino.""

Cuba had pioneered hurricane detection, and its meteorologists at the time held a more sophisticated understanding of how these storms worked than the Americans. But the forecasters from the United States, which maintained a heavy military presence on the island in the wake of the Spanish-American War, foolishly dismissed them all as backward and laughed at their methods. Trying to centralize control of forecasting, the Weather Bureau persuaded the War Department to ban telegraph operators on Cuba from transmitting forecasts unless they were from the U.S. government. That meant that key information was not passed to the U.S. mainland as the hurricane barreled toward Galveston.

Experts knew a storm was coming, but they had no idea how intense it was or what course it was on. Ironically, because of missing measurements and analysts wrongly interpreting what limited data they had, the government believed that it was a tropical storm and that it was heading for Tampa -- not Texas. An advisory was sent out saying as much just hours before the hurricane hit Galveston. ""The bureau had few hard facts about the storm, yet what is remarkable about its cables that day is the complete absence of doubt or qualification,"" Larson writes.

Serious people mistook signs back then that would be obvious today to anyone who paid even a little attention in their high school science classes. Swells were coming in very slowly at Galveston, at intervals between one to five minutes. This should have been a red flag, obviously, but it somehow reassured people who were on the beach that the storm wasn't going to be too bad.

Other mistakes were made that wouldn't be repeated today. Concerned about fire, for instance, the city required that all roofs be shingled with slate, not wood. That made the hurricane much deadlier when the slate started flying around.

-- In its April edition, Popular Science chronicled how much the federal government's satellites and technology for interpreting data have improved even in the past few decades: ""Although predicting where tumultuous weather might go is challenging, NOAA's errors in storm tracking have been cut in half in the last 12 to 15 years ... And beginning five years ago, the agency could give imperiled residents 12 more hours of notice that a hurricane was expected to hit (we now get 36 hours of advanced noticed -- up from 24 hours). ... In a 2007 study published in Natural Hazards Review, scientists demonstrated that improved storm forecasting prevented up to 90 percent of deaths that would have occurred should satellite-less, error-prone technology still have been used to predict hurricanes. The researchers found that between 1970 and 2004, an average of around 20 people died from hurricanes each year. But if forecasts were as faulty as they were in the 1950s, they estimated that 200 people would have died each year, simply because significantly more people had settled into the path of destructive cyclones. 'The bottom line is that the number of deaths have been going down, but the coastal population has been going up,' says Hugh Willoughby, the study's lead author and a hurricane researcher at Florida International University.""

-- There has also been a paradigm shift in how public officials prepare for storms. Politicians have become more likely over time to err on the side of caution when it comes to ordering evacuations. Back in 1900, the Weather Bureau (which became the National Weather Service in 1970) banned the use of the word ""tornado"" in dispatches to avoid panicking people. The government-run network also ""took special pains to avoid using the word hurricane, except when absolutely necessary or when stipulating that a particular storm was not a hurricane,"" Larson writes. ""The Weather Bureau's reluctance to use words like hurricane and cyclone inadvertently reinforced the bravado of sea captains.""

-- While many still die from big hurricanes -- Katrina took about 1,200 lives in 2005 -- the causes of death are different than in the past: ""Many deaths that follow a big storm in the U.S. come in the days and weeks afterward -- especially if there are power outages,"" NBC News reported last year. ""Carbon monoxide poisoning often leads the list, as people turn to grills and gas stoves. 'About 70 people die every year and many more are injured from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by portable generators,' the Consumer Product Safety Commission warns. 'Carbon monoxide (CO) from a generator used indoors can kill you and your family in minutes.' ... In 2008, Hurricane Ike hit the Texas coast near Galveston, killing 74 people in Texas and Louisiana. The largest percentage were people who died from carbon monoxide poisoning after the storm had passed and left 2.3 million people without power -- 13 people died this way, state health officials reported. Eight people drowned and 12 died of heart attacks, strokes and other heart-related causes.""

-- Hubris is the most interesting theme in Larson's book. ""The nation in 1900 was swollen with pride and technological confidence,"" he writes. ""There was talk even of controlling the weather -- of subduing hail with cannon blasts and igniting forest fires to bring rain. In this new age, nature itself seemed no great obstacle.""

Even though they're vastly more accurate, today's forecasts include nuance and acknowledge uncertainty. For most of last week, it remained unclear whether Irma would make landfall on the east or west coast of Florida, for example, and the government's forecasts said as much.

David Von Drehle marvels in his column for today's paper that Irma reminds us of all we still don't know about the natural world: ""As 21st-century heirs to the Enlightenment, we know an awful lot. We know how to edit a gene. We know how to convert millions of simultaneous messages -- conversations, texts, memes, movies -- into packets of ones and zeros and speed them from tower to tower to another person's hand. We know how to convert the energy of sunlight into a ride in the car. Yet we still don't know everything. In the case of Irma, meteorologists and their computers could read the air currents across a hemisphere and forecast the storm's eventual collision with an air mass that would push it sharply to the north. What they could not predict five days in advance, the hole in their knowledge, was the precise spot above Earth where the collision would occur...

""One could choose to marvel at the overall accuracy of the forecast or grumble about its imperfection. The difference is largely a matter of temperament,"" David concludes. ""Across the Caribbean, throughout Florida, in sodden Houston and shaken Mexico and elsewhere in this world of death and woe, nature is reminding us of all we have yet to learn -- and all that is beyond our paltry control.""

IRMA LATEST:

-- Hurricane Irma plowed into Florida on Sunday, reminding everyone that when a tropical cyclone reaches a certain size, ""it simply can't miss."" From Patricia Sullivan, Leonard Shapiro, Perry Stein and Joel Achenbach: ""This storm was nearly as big as the state of Florida, which is why everything but the Panhandle was under a hurricane warning. Irma's broad wind field also meant that when the winds picked up, they stayed up as the storm howled northward. Even cities far outside the eye of the storm found themselves caught in an atmospheric blender that had no off switch.""

-- On Sunday afternoon, Irma was downgraded to a Category 2 storm, though the National Hurricane Center said it is ""expected to remain a powerful hurricane"" with sustained 100 mph winds. She is slated to hit Georgia today, with tropical storm and hurricane conditions also predicted in Alabama and parts of South Carolina. (Capital Weather Gang)

-- Tampa Bay may escape the worst of its nightmare scenario. ""Irma weakened as it approached Tampa Bay and was expected to pass over the area as a Category 1 storm -- still dangerous enough to cause flooding and wind damage,"" Darryl Fears and Katie Mettler report.

-- Florida officials praised Washington's response. Via Robert Costa and Ashley Parker:

-- First responders are still taking stock of the sprawling damage in large parts of the Caribbean. Anthony Faiola reports from Haiti: ""On St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands, 'people there are roaming like zombies,' said [a bar owner] who managed to leave for the mainland. Her husband, who is still there, told her Sunday[:] 'It's like the walking dead down there.'""

-- Keep an eye on Hurricane Jose. From Greg Porter: ""Jose, a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, is currently located a few hundred miles to the north of Puerto Rico, steadily moving toward the northwest and away from land at 16 mph. Jose is expected to continue this general motion and speed over the next 24 hours. However, after Monday night, Jose may slam on the brakes hard, ceasing nearly all forward motion, probably setting up a roller-coaster-like path that will take the storm in a series of loops, circles, dips and dives ... Unable to move to the north and restricted from moving to the east by a developing upper-level high pressure, Jose should have no choice but to meander for a few days between Bermuda and the southeast U.S.""

-- The Washington Post is providing free digital access to all hurricane-related coverage. (Follow live updates from our in-house meteorologists here.)

-- Thousands of victims' relatives, survivors, and rescuers are expected to gather today at the World Trade Center to commemorate those who died 16 years ago in the deadliest attack on American soil. (AP)

-- At the White House, President Trump and the first lady will lead a moment of silence before attending an observance event at the Pentagon. Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph Dunford are hosting a private observance for victims' relatives there at 9:11 a.m. Vice President Pence and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are slated to deliver remarks at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pa. Construction remains underway at the site, and on Sunday, ground was broken for a 98-foot tall ""Towers of Voices"" monument honoring the passengers and crew onboard the flight.

-- A new memorial on Long Island is being dedicated today, not just to those who lost their lives on 9/11 but also those who died of illnesses stemming from the attacks. (LA Times)

-- ""Sixteen Years After 9/11, How Does Terrorism End?"" by the New Yorker's Robin Wright: ""The current spasm of international terrorism, an age-old tactic of warfare, is often traced to a bomb mailed from New York by [to Havana in 1968]. Since then, almost four hundred thousand people have died in terrorist attacks worldwide, on airplanes and trains, in shopping malls, schools, embassies, cinemas, apartment blocks, government offices, and businesses ... In the run-up to the 9/11 anniversary, I reached out to [terrorism experts] ... who identified six ways terrorism evolves, fades, or dies -- and under what conditions it succeeds.""

THE TRUMP AGENDA:

-- Since making a deal with Democrats last week, Trump has received only muted backlash from Republicans lawmakers and activists -- a reaction that should serve as a warning for the rest of the party. Michael Scherer reports in his debut story for The Post: ""The president has never seen himself as a party standard-bearer, but as the leader for a growing share of the electorate furious at the haplessness of the political system. [He] has tied his fortunes to a growth in the share of voters more focused on shaking up the system than in prescribing specific ideas for its replacement. ... The 2009 tea party rebellion in the Republican Party, which began as a demand for less government spending, seamlessly morphed into broad support for Trump's 2016 campaign, despite his promises to resist cuts to government entitlement programs and his disinterest in lowering federal deficits. The trend could have significant implications not only for the coming legislative negotiations but for the midterm elections next year.""

-- The New York Times reports that Trump's executive actions have promoted the conservative social agenda. From Ben Protess, Danielle Ivory and Steve Eder: ""The aggressive regulatory effort ... has led to policy changes related to gun ownership, gay rights, reproductive choices, immigration and other divisive political issues, according to a New York Times review of government documents and court records ... The turnabout stems in part from lobbying by evangelical Christians and other conservative groups. In interviews, these groups said they have regular discussions on domestic and foreign policy with the administration -- more so than during the presidency of George W. Bush ... Top White House officials have led the outreach, including Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's Orthodox Jewish son-in-law, and Vice President Mike Pence, a staunch social and religious Christian conservative. Kellyanne Conway, a senior aide, counted some of these groups among her paying clients before joining the White House ...

""Yet the new direction has also met some resistance among rank-and-file civil servants. Within the Justice Department, several long-serving lawyers have decided to retire or quit rather than help carry out the new policies.""

-- Jeff Sessions has suggested that every member of the National Security Council staff should be forced to take a lie-detector test as part of an ongoing effort to root out leakers in the administration. Axios's Jonathan Swan reports: ""Sessions' idea is to do a one-time, one-issue, polygraph test of everyone on the NSC staff. Interrogators would sit down with every single NSC staffer (there's more than 100 of them), and ask them, individually, what they know about the leaks of transcripts of the president's phone calls with foreign leaders. Sessions suspects those leaks came from within the NSC, and thinks that a polygraph test -- at the very least -- would scare them out of leaking again.""

-- The New York Times's Sheryl Gay Stolberg writes that Speaker Paul Ryan might actually emerge strengthened from his battles with Trump. Of the spending deal Trump struck with Democrats, House conservatives are furious with the president: ""'It was thrown at [Ryan],'"" said Representative Mark Sanford [R-S.C.] ... a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, referring to the fiscal deal. 'He didn't create it; he's reacting to it. I think he laid out a course that was acceptable to the conference as a whole, and to conservatives as well, and he had the rug pulled out from underneath him' ...

'Some of us feel that we got jammed when you couple Harvey disaster aid and the debt limit,' said one outspoken conservative, Representative Dave Brat [R-Va.]. He added, 'The leadership just needs to give us right now a tax plan.' Representative Mark Meadows [R-N.C.] and Freedom Caucus chairman, agreed, warning in an interview that failure on the tax plan would be 'extremely damaging for the speaker and for all members of the G.O.P. conference, as well as the president.'""

BANNON'S WAR:

-- Steve Bannon declared ""war"" against Republican congressional leaders in an interview that aired last night on CBS's ""60 Minutes."" Ashley Parker reports on the former White House chief strategist's comments: ""He accused Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan of 'trying to nullify the 2016 election.' He blamed them for failing to repeal and replace [Obamacare], and made clear that he would use his Breitbart perch to hold Republicans accountable for not helping Trump push through his agenda. 'They're not going to help you unless they're put on notice,' he [said]. 'They're going to be held accountable if they do not support the president of the United States. Right now there's no accountability.'""

-- Bannon and other Trump allies are planning a slate of primary challenges against Republican senators -- a move that threatens to drain millions from party coffers, and possibly undermine GOP prospects in 2018. Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports: ""Bannon has begun holding private meetings with insurgent challengers, vowing his support. He's coordinating with conservative mega-donor Robert Mercer, who is prepared to pour millions of dollars into attacks on GOP incumbents. Bannon has also installed a confidant at an outside group that is expected to target Republican lawmakers and push the Trump agenda. The activity has alarmed senior Republicans [and] McConnell has repeatedly expressed concern to the White House about the danger primaries pose to his members, stressing that it could imperil his narrow four-seat majority. ... Bannon is paying little heed to those warnings. On Thursday, he huddled with Danny Tarkanian, an attorney who is challenging Sen. Dean Heller."" He is also intent on unseating Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). Former Trump campaign official David Bossie has embarked on an effort to recruit several potential primary challengers, including former Rep. Matt Salmon.

SUNDAY SHOW HIGHLIGHTS:

-- ""Sen. John McCain, battling brain cancer, reflected on a life well lived in an emotional interview Sunday, saying he was 'very happy' with his 81 years and noting, 'Every life has to end, one way or another,'"" Robert Costa and Ashley Parker report: ""Speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN's 'State of the Union,' McCain offered an optimistic update on his health -- 'the prognosis is pretty good' -- and acknowledged the challenges he's facing. 'Look, this is a very vicious form of cancer that I'm facing, but all the results so far are excellent,' he said. McCain thanked the doctors ... and [presented] himself as a man at peace[:] 'I'm very happy with my life, I'm very happy with what I have been able to do,' he said. 'And there's two ways of looking at these things. And one of them is to celebrate. I am able to celebrate a wonderful life, and I will be grateful for additional time that I have.' When Tapper said he hoped it was not his last interview with McCain, the senator quipped, 'A lot of people want it to be the last.'""

-- Hillary Clinton ruled out the possibility of running for office again in 2020, saying on CBS that she is ""done being a candidate."" Robert Costa reports: Speaking days before the release of her 2016 campaign memoir, ""What Happened,"" Clinton told CBS's Jane Pauley that she plans to stay involved in national politics, though not as an ""active politician."" ""But I am not done with politics because I literally believe that our country's future is at stake,"" she said. Clinton also criticized Trump's preparedness for the White House: ""We have a reality show that leads to the election of a president ... [Now] he says, 'Boy, it's so much harder than I thought it would be. This is really tough. I had no idea,' Clinton said. 'Well, yeah, because it's not a show. It's real. It's reality, for sure.'""

THERE IS A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- Russia is readying for its ""war games"" this week -- a major installment that simulates its plan for a war with NATO, and comes as relations with the Western world plummet to all-time lows. David Filipov and Michael Birnbaum report: ""The exercises will show off a military that has been transformed under [Putin] into an effective force that has deployed to Syria and Ukraine in recent years. Moscow has insisted that the exercises will rehearse a strictly defensive scenario and will involve no more than 12,700 troops .... But senior Western government officials believe the real number of Russian military personnel involved could reach 100,000 or more. ... At NATO headquarters in Brussels, senior officials say their intelligence services are closely monitoring Russia as it draws up its military alongside their borders. They say that Moscow's unwillingness to open the exercises to observation raises the risk of unplanned conflict stemming from misunderstandings.""

-- As Germany prepares to head to the polls this month, many are baffled by a growing mystery: Where are the Russians? Griff Witte reports: ""In 2015, suspected Russian hackers broke into the computer networks of the German Parliament and made off with a mother lode of data, [and] ever since, German politicians have been watching nervously for the fruits of that hack to be revealed[.] But with the vote only two weeks away -- and with [Putin's] European nemesis, Chancellor Angela Merkel, seemingly on track for a comfortable win -- the hacked emails haven't materialized. Nor have Russian-linked propaganda networks ... [and] even Kremlin-orchestrated [bots] have been conspicuously silent. The apparent absence of a robust Russian campaign to sabotage the German vote has become a mystery among officials and experts who had warned of a likely onslaught. ... Have Germany's defensive measures -- significantly boosted after the hacks and propaganda campaigns that preceded last November's U.S. vote -- actually succeeded? Or perhaps Moscow is simply biding its time. 'That's what makes me worried,' said Maksymilian Czuperski, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. 'Why is it so quiet? It doesn't feel right.'""

Donald Trump Jr. responded to Internet trolls who asked why Mar-A-Lago is not open to Irma evacuees:

Hurricane Irma was so strong that sea waters were literally sucked away from the shoreline. But weather forecasters said the water could return in a matter of minutes -- and frantically urged residents to stay away from the bizarre-looking beaches:

-- The Guardian, ""The Wall Street Journal's Trump problem,"" by Lucia Graves: ""Dozens have left the paper in the past year and interviews with current and ex-staffers show outrage over pressure from management to normalize Trump.""

-- It was during the French Revolution that Napoleon first outlined the concept of a national lost and found, asserting as a basic right man's uninterrupted right to his possessions. More than 200 years later, the New Yorker explores France's ""Bureau of Found Objects"" -- and how the sprawling underground facility, which receives more than 100,000 items annually, specializes in the unique, improbable art of reunification. (New Yorker)

-- Another warm, comfortable day today. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: ""High pressure stays mostly in control, even as it starts to give way to Irma's influence from the south. That means partly sunny skies and afternoon highs into the mid-70s.""

-- The Nationals clinched the National League East title, and earned a spot in the playoffs, by beating the Phillies 3-2 on Sunday. (Chelsea Janes)

80,80,"Human tutors will be sidelined in near future as AI takes central role in education, suggests Sir Anthony Sheldon of Wellington College

Inspirational teachers of the future will be intelligent machines rather than humans, the influential head of one of Britain's most famous public schools predicts.

Within 10 years a technological revolution will sweep aside old notions of education and change the world forever, Sir Anthony Sheldon, master of Wellington College believes.

School teachers will lose their traditional role and effectively become little more than classroom assistants.

Read more AI can secretly be trained to behave 'maliciously' and cause accidents

They will remain on hand to set up equipment, help children when necessary and maintain discipline, Sir Anthony said.

However, the essential job of instilling knowledge into young minds will wholly be done by artificially intelligent (AI) computers.

Sir Anthony, a historian and political commentator who has written biographies of ex-prime ministers David Cameron, Tony Blair, John Major and Gordon Brown, said: ""It certainly will change human life as we know it.

""It will open up the possibility of an Eton or Wellington education for all.

""Everyone can have the very best teacher and it's completely personalised; the software you're working with will be with you throughout your education journey.

""It can move at the speed of the learner.

""This is beyond anything that we've seen in the industrial revolution or since with any other new technology.

""These are adaptive machines that adapt to individuals. They will listen to the voices of the learners, read their faces and study them in the way gifted teachers study their students.

""We're looking at screens which are listening to the voice of the student and reading the face of the student. Reading and comprehending.""

Sir Anthony outlined his vision in a talk at the British Science Festival which took place last week in Brighton.

It will also be the subject of his new book The Fourth Education Revolution, due to be published early next year.

The first revolution consisted of learning the basics of survival - foraging, hunting, growing crops and building shelters - he said.

The second involved the first organised sharing of knowledge and the third was marked by the invention of printing.

In the AI classrooms, each child will progress at his or her own pace, said Sir Anthony.

There would be no more set courses applicable to all students as teaching, carried out by emotionally sensitive machines, would be highly personalised.

Asked if he was suggesting machines would replace the inspirational role of teachers, he said: ""I'm desperately sad about this but I'm afraid I am.

""The machines will be extraordinarily inspirational.

""You'll still have the humans there walking around during school time, but in fact the inspiration in terms of intellectual excitement will come from the lighting-up of the brain which the machines will be superbly well-geared for.

""The machines will know what it is that most excites you and gives you a natural level of challenge that is not too hard or too easy, but just right for you.""

He expected the National Union of Teachers to be ""very alarmed"" by the prospect, a feeling he shared.

""The technology's already beginning to arrive,"" he said. ""It's already there on the west coast of the US and it's already beginning to transform schools.

""I'm expecting this to happen in the next 10 years.

After months of scrutiny, Chinese authorities are reportedly planning on shutting down domestic bitcoin exchanges.

Only last week China's central bank warned that, in its view, initial coin offerings were illegal and that any such activity should be blocked immediately.

According to press reports, the People's Bank of China has taken it one step further and has led a draft of instructions that would ban Chinese platforms from providing virtual currency trading services.

The price of bitcoin is down 1.4% today at US$4,183 per coin.

12.15pm...Kim Jong-Un the reason for Monday's bullishness

""On a day that is largely devoid of any major economic releases of note, it is Kim Jong-Un who provides the unlikely source of bullish sentiment evident throughout global markets this morning,"" said IG's Josh Mahony.

""With North Korea celebrating the anniversary of the nation's formation over the weekend, it has come as a surprise that we did not see a third consecutive weekend test from Kim Jong-Un.

Given that North Korea has provided one of the main drivers of volatility in recent weeks, today's UN meeting over the potential implementation of further sanctions on the country will be crucial in gauging how likely we are to see further tests in the near future.

""With the US pushing for an oil embargo on North Korea, the Chinese and Russian decisions will be key, where their cooperation would be a kick in the teeth for Pyongyang leadership, sparking a likely military response.""

11.50am...London still the financial centre of the world

London has kept its crown as the world's most attractive financial centre, despite fears that Brexit would see it drop down the rankings.

The City extended its advantage over its nearest rival New York, although Frankfurt and Dublin have narrowed the gap slightly.

The Z/Yen global financial centres index - which ranks cities on things such as financial infrastructure and jobs - said the gap between London and New York was as its widest since the survey began ten years ago.

11.30am...Hornby on the rails as CEO set to depart

Steve Cooke, the boss of Hornby PLC (LON:HRN), has become the first victim of the model train maker's strategy review after just over a year at the helm.

No official leaving date has been set and Cooke will carry on chief executive for a short while yet, but both parties have mutually agreed to part ways once the transition period is over.

Hornby has been trying to reverse falling sales in recent years without much success and recently said that trading so far this year has been even weaker than expected.

The firm announced earlier this year that it was reviewing its strategy after its largest shareholder Phoenix Asset Management increased its stake.

""The position of Phoenix as Hornby's majority shareholder represents a new chapter in the development of the group and the board is working closely with Phoenix to set the direction of the business going forward.""

Shares in the toy manufacturer fell 4% to 27.4p.

11.05am ... Primark shows UK consumer 'tightening their purse strings'

""The UK has been singled out as performing particularly strongly, which would normally have positive read-across for the rest of the clothing sector,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon.

""However, this probably isn't the case this time. We feel Primark's good domestic performance is more a sign the UK consumer is tightening the purse strings and moving down the value chain as inflation outstrips wage growth.

""At the moment, over a million square feet of sales space is being added every year, and this roll-out story means ABF shares trade on a more premium rating than many of its peers.

""The US is particularly important. Progress here looks good, but investors should remember that many other UK retailers have tried and failed to crack the notoriously competitive market across the pond.""

11am ... Insurers rally as hurricane Irma downgraded

British insurers are on the up thanks to the news that hurricane Irma isn't likely to hit the US as badly as had been feared last week.

Aviva PLC (LON:AV.) (up 1.2% to 512p), Legal & General Group PLC (LON:LGEN) (up 2% to 259p) and Prudential PLC (LON:PRU) (up 1.9% to £17.96) were all boosted as Irma was downgraded to a category one storm.

The weakening of the storm - which made landfall in Florida over the weekend - means that the number of insurance claims is likely to be less than investors had been pencilling in.

""The damage caused will surely be costly, but the devastation wasn't as bad as investors were bracing themselves for.""

10.45am ... British Land buoyed by Deutsche Bank upgrade

The FTSE 100 continues to bubble away nicely on a dreary morning here in London.

The blue chip index is currently up 47.8 points, or 0.7%, to 7,425.4 with drugs giant AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) still leading the way.

Not too far is UK property developer British Land Company PLC (LON:BLND) after it was upgraded by Deutsche Bank.

Analyst at the German banking giant said it was reversing its bearish view of the UK real estate sector, adding that it sees the ""best risk/ reward"" in British Land, which it has moved to a 'buy'.

""The portfolio is now weighted towards the less volatile West End and the near-term development pipe adds meaningful portfolio income.

""Recent disposals above book value and subsequent buybacks highlight good capital management and we increase our forecasts to reflect our positive outlook.""

After a strong run in recent weeks off the back of goings on in North Korea, the gold price gave up some of those gains today as it fell back by 0.6% to US$1,338.5 an ounce.

Unsurprisingly that weighed on gold miners Fresnillo PLC (LON:FRES) and Randgold Resources Limited (LON:RRS), which shed 1% and 1.5% respectively.

There was more trouble in Tanzania, this time for FTSE 250-listed Petra Diamonds PLC (LON:PDL).

The Tanzanian government accused Petra of under-declaring its mineral exports and blocked it from shipping a parcel of diamonds worth almost US$30mln.

As you'd expect, the miner denied any wrongdoing and said that government officials oversee its production and that is the government who determines the value of the stones and not the company.

That denial wasn't enough to reassure shareholders and the stock is the worst performer on the second-tier; down 8.5% to 82.4p.

Perhaps investors are concerned that Petra might suffer a similar fate to Acacia Mining PLC (LON:ACA) which was also recently banned from exporting gold and copper concentrate from its Tanzanian mines.

8.40am ... AB Foods upgrades full-year outlook but investors aren't buying it

Primark owner Associated British Foods PLC (LON:ABF) has upped its full-year guidance, thanks as ever to the continued strong performance of its value fashion chain.

On top of that, the group's food business is also performing well in its fourth quarter. As a result, ABF said it expects to ""report good growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share for the group for the full year.""

It added that full-year sales should be 13% ahead of last year on a constant currency basis, with like-for-likes up 1%.

There was also news of an acquisition after AB Foods announced it had signed an agreement to snap up leading Italian vinegar producer, Acetum.

All of that wasn't enough for investors who were obviously hungry for more; shares dipped 1.2% to £32.28 on Monday morning.

Proactive news headlines:

ANGLE PLC has established a co-marketing agreement with QIAGEN NV, a world-leading provider of molecular testing solutions. The AIM-listed liquid biopsy firm said the partnership will ""seek to leverage the advantages of combining ANGLE's world leading Parsortix system for harvesting circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with QIAGEN's liquid biopsy solution portfolio"".

North Sea focused Jersey Oil & Gas PLC (LON:JOG) has revealed that the Statoil operated Verbier exploration has been unsuccessful, finding the target reservoir to be water bearing and deeper-than-expected.

Mosman Oil And Gas Limited (LON:MSMN) has unveiled its latest acquisition in North America, picking up the Welch Permian basin project in West Texas in a US$310,000 deal. The company said the project, located about 550 kilometres from Dallas, comprises ten existing production wells plus ten shut-in wells and seven injectors. It presently produces around 34 barrels of oil per day.

Rose Petroleum PLC (LON:ROSE) has announced that a binding stock purchase agreement (SPA) has now been signed with Magellan Gold Corporation in relation to the previously proposed deal for Rose's metal processing operation in Mexico.

Tlou Energy Limited (LON:TLOU) boss Tony Gilby has handed in his annual report card on what he called a ""phenomenal year"" for the company.

Michael Travia, managing director of fast-growing office productivity software group BOS GLOBAL Holdings (LON:BOS), has quit the company.

Atlantis Resources Limited (LON:ARL) noted that, as expected, its MeyGen Limited subsidiary was not awarded a 2071 contracts for difference allocation for renewable energy projects by the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS). However, the AIM-listed tidal power generation firm it has commenced a dialogue with BEIS officials to ""recognise the benefits of either a bi-lateral CfD discussion or the reintroduction of a marine energy sub-category in the next allocation round, either of which would be welcomed by Atlantis.""

Be Heard Group PLC (LON:BHRD) saw ""exceptional revenue growth"" in the first half and expects the growth rate to pick up in the second half.

Genedrive PLC (LON:GDR), the molecular diagnostics company, said its Genedrive HCV ID kit has achieved CE certification under the EU Medical Devices Directive.

Seeing Machines Limited (LON:SEE) saw like-for-like revenues soar once again last year and the eye-tracking technology specialist has now set its sights on turning over US$100mln by the end of 2019. Like-for-like sales more than doubled in the year ended 30 June to A$13.6mln (2016: A$6.1mln), driven by another strong performance from its Guardian fleet division.

Allergy Therapeutics PLC (LON:AGY) has strengthened its clinical research team with two senior appointments. Pieter-Jan de Kam joins as clinical director, while Simon Piggott will become head of clinical science.

Diversfied Gas & Oil PLC 's (LON:DCOG) production surged in the half year to June as the recent package of 1,300 wells in the US contributed for the first time.

Ortac Resources Ltd (LON:OTC) has announced that from henceforth it will focus on two gold projects in Africa held as investments, Casa Mining and Zamsort. The move follows the appointments of Nick von Schirnding and Brian McMaster to the board and the passing of all resolutions at an AGM last week.

8.20am ... AstraZeneca leading the way for the blue chips

The FTSE 100 has started the week in steady fashion, up 31.6 points to 7,409.2.

AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) is currently leading the way after it announced positive results from two separate Phase III trials of a couple of its key lung cancer drugs.

The Pacific trial of Imfinzi showed an improvement in progression-free survival by 11 months compared with standard of care in patients with locally-advanced unresectable lung cancer.

In the Flaura trial, Tagrisso reduced the risk of progression or death in patients with and without brain metastases by more than half.

Shares in the pharma giant jumped 3.1% shortly after the opening bell to £49.20 as Astra's stock continues to recover from the disappointing Mystic study results in July.

On the second tier, Carillion PLC (LON:CLLN) took another bashing after its finance director Zafar Kahn, along with a slew of other top executives, stepped down.

The boardroom shake-up comes just a couple of months after the construction and support services group initiated a strategic review following a shock profit warning.

AIM-quoted Jersey Oil and Gas PLC (LON:JOG) was struggling down in the minor leagues after striking out with its Statoil-operated exploration well.

The North Sea-focused explorer said drilling had showed the target reservoir to be water bearing and deeper-than-expected.

Investors had pinned a lot of hope on this particular target and shares collapsed by more than 80% as soon as the market opened to sit at 42p.

6.45am ... FTSE 100 seen higher at open

The FTSE 100 is seen opening higher following overnight gains in Asia as an easing of worries over the nuclear threat from North Korea offsets concerns about the impact of Hurricane Irma on the US state of Florida.

However some caution is also likely as investors await a key batch of UK data and the latest Bank of England policy meeting later this week.

Spread betting firm CMC Markets expects the FTSE 100 index to open around 28 points higher at 7,405 having closed 19 points lower on Friday.

On Friday, US markets ended mixed and fairly subdued, with the Dow Jones Industrials adding just 13 points at 21,797, while the broader S&P 500 index and tech-laden Nasdaq both ended modestly lower as investors waited to see what impact Hurricane Irma will have on Florida.

But Asian markets managed more substantive gains today as North Korea's leaders choose to party this weekend rather than launch more missiles. Japan's Nikkei 225 added over 1.3% helped also by a weaker yen versus the dollar which boosted exporters.

No important UK economic data will be released today - although inflation numbers come tomorrow and unemployment and average earnings will be released on Thursday - so the main focus will be on the week's early corporate news.

Primark sales eyed

Associated British Foods PLC (LON:ABF) should attract the most attention with blue chip food to clothing retail conglomerate issuing a fourth quarter trading update.

Conditions at the group's high street discount fashion chain Primark, as always, will be the main focus.

In a preview, analysts at JPMorgan said they expect Primark to deliver fourth quarter like-for-like sales growth of +2%, which would take the chain's full-year like-for-like increase to +1%.

Overall, they are forecasting Primark's full-year constant currency sales to grow by +13%, in line with the 9-month trend.

The analysts said: ""We expect management to reiterate its full year expectation for 'good growth' in group adjusted operating profit & EPS and forecast +20% & +17% yoy, respectively "".

They said they also expect AB Food's management to highlight some upside risk to Primark profitability if current euro strength is maintained.

And the analysts think recent currency moves should also be favourable for the firm's British Sugar business, although they added that they are mindful that, given a decline in the world sugar price, it is possible this simply offsets some underlying downside risk to current sugar forecasts.

Significant events expected on Monday September 11:

83,83,"Irma has been downgraded to a category one hurricane, news which was welcomed by travel companies and insurers here in London FTSE 100 closes at 7,413 London still world's most attractive financial centre Apple to launch 'iPhone X' tomorrow US stocks higher

FTSE 100 kept its head above the 7,400 level on Monday and closed almost 36 points ahead at 7,413 as US shares were on the up.

""The lack of hostilities in relation to North Korea and the downgrading of Hurricane Irma to a category one storm has prompted traders to buy back into the market.,"" said analyst at CMC Markets, David Madden.

Meanwhile, the mid-cap index FTSE 250 was up over 83 points to close at 19,694.

Brent crude lost ground and the cost of a barrel of the black stuff eased 1.38% to US$53.75.

In the currency markets, the pound was up 0.45% against the Euro and down 0.11% against the US dollar.

Top riser on Footsie was Provident Financial (LON: PFG), which gained 3.77% to 825p, while low cost carrier easyJet (LON:EZJ) flew 3.37% higher at 1,195p as news from the US suggested the storm damage was not as bad as feared.

Top loser was Primark owner Associated British Foods plc (LON:ABF), which shed 4.96% to 3,103p.

It comes despite investors in today's pre-close update that its full-year results would beat what it posted in 2016.

Worries over cost pressures in ABF's grocery business and expectations for currency tailwinds to reverse in the coming months offset the raised guidance, however.

3pm - US markets start on front foot

As expected, the US markets started the week on the front foot thanks to cooling tensions with North Korea and less-than-expected damage from hurricane Irma.

Financial stocks helped to lift the Dow Jones index back towards the 22,000 mark as it opened 182 points higher at 21,979.

Kura Oncology Inc (NASDAQ:KURA) was still shining after Friday's successful trial results for its lead cancer candidate. The biopharma helped to propel the Nasdaq 72.9 points, or 1.1%, higher to 6,433.2.

The S&P also opened higher; up 19.8 points, or 0.8%, to 2,481.4.

FTSE 100 gives up some gains as pound strengthens

Back in London, the FTSE 100 gave up some of the morning's gains once the US markets opened with a weaker dollar boosting sterling.

A stronger pound is generally bad news for the blue chips as it makes their foreign currency-denominated earnings worth less when translated back into sterling. It also makes exports more expensive to overseas buyers.

The blue chip index is currently up 26.3 points to 7,403.5.

AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) has been towards the top of the leaderboard for most of the day after it announced positive results from two separate Phase III trials of a couple of its key lung cancer drugs.

The pharma giant is currently up 2.6%, or 125p, to £49.

Downgrading of Irma helps travel companies, insurers

Elsewhere, the downgrading of hurricane Irma to a category one storm and the fact that the damage hasn't been as bad as initially feared has helped the travel companies today.

British-American cruise operator Carnival PLC (LON:CLL) is 2.5% higher to £51.65, while budget airline Easyjet PLC (LON:EZJ) has gained 2.2% to sit at £11.81.

Insurers were also liking the news that claims from the hurricane are likely to be lower than originally thought.

Aviva PLC (LON:AV.) (up 0.7% to 510p), Legal & General Group PLC (LON:LGEN) (up 1.3% to 257p) and Prudential PLC (LON:PRU) (up 1.4% to £17.87) were all boosted.

AB Foods and gold miners out of favour

Primark owner Associated British Foods plc (LON:ABF) has been out of favour despite telling investors in today's pre-close update that its full-year results would trounce what it posted in 2016.

Worries over cost pressures in ABF's grocery business and expectations for currency tailwinds to reverse in the coming months offset the raised guidance and shares fell 5% to £31 making it the biggest blue chip casualty.

Gold miners were also nursing losses today as the 'risk-on' attitude of the markets signalled a slide in the price of gold, which is traditionally viewed as a safe haven. Fresnillo PLC (LON:FRES) and Randgold Resources Limited (LON:RRS) both slipped by almost 1.5% to £16 and £80.10 respectively.

2.15pm...New plastic tenner to come into circulation this week

After the recent introductions of a plastic £5 note and a 12-sided £1 coin, the new £10 note is set to come into circulation later this week.

It will be shinier and smaller than the current tenner and feature the face of Pride and Prejudice author Jane Austen. Oh, it will also contain traces of animal fat.

The official release date is this Thursday and most bank branches are expected to have the new notes within a couple of days.

If the introduction of the new fiver earlier this year is anything to go by, keep any eye out on the serial numbers. Some of the early batches or notes with particularly significant numbers (such as AA01444444) sold for thousands on eBay.

1.20pm...US stocks to open higher

The FTSE 100 has enjoyed a strong start to the week so far, up 26.5 points to 7,404.1. It had been as high as 7,430 earlier on.

Airlines were flying high today, with the news that the damage from the US is likely to be not as bad as had been feared coupled with a seeming cooling of tensions between the US and North Korea boosting sentiment.

Easyjet PLC (LON:EZJY) rose 2.5% to £11.85, BA owner International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC (LON:IAG) added 1.4% to trade at 602p, while Wizz Air Holdings PLC (LON:WIZZ) also gained 1.1% to £29.

On the FTSE 250, doorstep lender Provident Financial PLC (LON:PFG) got a little bounce as it started life on the second tier, with shares up 3.8% to 824.9p. That said, the stock is still down more than 50% since it shock profit warning last month.

Among the small caps, UP Global Sourcing Holdings PLC (LON:UPGS) ran out of steam as it warned revenues were unlikely to grow until next year as consumers' spending power comes ""under pressure"". Shares slipped by 47.5% to 110.2p.

Looking ahead to market open in the United States, the strong trading seen in Europe looks set to continue.

Spread betting firms see all three major exchanges opening higher. The Dow Jones is expected to rise by 124 points at the opening bell to 21,925, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is seen as opening 41.8 points in the black at 5,656.2.

Completing the sweep is the S&P 500, which is seen 12.8 points higher at 2,475.2.

12.50pm...Apple investors not deterred by latest leak

Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 10th anniversary iPhone will be called the iPhone X and will feature facial recognition technology, a leak has revealed ahead of its official launch tomorrow.

The leak, reported by Apple-based publications 9to5Mac and MacRumors, revealed the company is planning on unveiling three new devices, including the iPhone X, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus.

The iPhone X is Apple's premium version and is rumoured to be priced at close to US$1,000.

Apple's new IPhone X is apparently going to cost more than a grand. For that money I'd expect airplane mode to take me on friggin' holiday! -- Tony Shepherd (@tonysheps)

September 11, 2017

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will be basic upgrades to the 7 and 7 Plus models and will feature wireless inductive charging, glass back panels and a new micro-processing chip, 9to5 Mac reported.

The leak is said to have come from a disgruntled Apple employee who wanted to sabotage the company.

Investors didn't seem too bothered about the leak, with Apple shares rising 1.2% to US$160.60.

12.30pm...Reports: China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges

After months of scrutiny, Chinese authorities are reportedly planning on shutting down domestic bitcoin exchanges.

Only last week China's central bank warned that, in its view, initial coin offerings were illegal and that any such activity should be blocked immediately.

According to press reports, the People's Bank of China has taken it one step further and has led a draft of instructions that would ban Chinese platforms from providing virtual currency trading services.

The FTSE 100 continues to bubble away nicely on a dreary morning here in London.

The blue chip index is currently up 47.8 points, or 0.7%, to 7,425.4 with drugs giant AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) still leading the way.

""Recent disposals above book value and subsequent buybacks highlight good capital management and we increase our forecasts to reflect our positive outlook.""

After a strong run in recent weeks off the back of goings on in North Korea, the gold price gave up some of those gains today as it fell back by 0.6% to US$1,338.5 an ounce.

Unsurprisingly that weighed on gold miners Fresnillo PLC (LON:FRES) and Randgold Resources Limited (LON:RRS), which shed 1% and 1.5% respectively.

There was more trouble in Tanzania, this time for FTSE 250-listed Petra Diamonds PLC (LON:PDL).

The Tanzanian government accused Petra of under-declaring its mineral exports and blocked it from shipping a parcel of diamonds worth almost US$30mln.

As you'd expect, the miner denied any wrongdoing and said that government officials oversee its production and that is the government who determines the value of the stones and not the company.

That denial wasn't enough to reassure shareholders and the stock is the worst performer on the second-tier; down 8.5% to 82.4p.

Perhaps investors are concerned that Petra might suffer a similar fate to Acacia Mining PLC (LON:ACA) which was also recently banned from exporting gold and copper concentrate from its Tanzanian mines.

8.40am ... AB Foods upgrades full-year outlook but investors aren't buying it

Primark owner Associated British Foods PLC (LON:ABF) has upped its full-year guidance, thanks as ever to the continued strong performance of its value fashion chain.

On top of that, the group's food business is also performing well in its fourth quarter. As a result, ABF said it expects to ""report good growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share for the group for the full year.""

It added that full-year sales should be 13% ahead of last year on a constant currency basis, with like-for-likes up 1%.

There was also news of an acquisition after AB Foods announced it had signed an agreement to snap up leading Italian vinegar producer, Acetum.

All of that wasn't enough for investors who were obviously hungry for more; shares dipped 1.2% to £32.28 on Monday morning.

Proactive news headlines:

ANGLE PLC has established a co-marketing agreement with QIAGEN NV, a world-leading provider of molecular testing solutions. The AIM-listed liquid biopsy firm said the partnership will ""seek to leverage the advantages of combining ANGLE's world leading Parsortix system for harvesting circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with QIAGEN's liquid biopsy solution portfolio"".

North Sea focused Jersey Oil & Gas PLC (LON:JOG) has revealed that the Statoil operated Verbier exploration has been unsuccessful, finding the target reservoir to be water bearing and deeper-than-expected.

Mosman Oil And Gas Limited (LON:MSMN) has unveiled its latest acquisition in North America, picking up the Welch Permian basin project in West Texas in a US$310,000 deal. The company said the project, located about 550 kilometres from Dallas, comprises ten existing production wells plus ten shut-in wells and seven injectors. It presently produces around 34 barrels of oil per day.

Rose Petroleum PLC (LON:ROSE) has announced that a binding stock purchase agreement (SPA) has now been signed with Magellan Gold Corporation in relation to the previously proposed deal for Rose's metal processing operation in Mexico.

Tlou Energy Limited (LON:TLOU) boss Tony Gilby has handed in his annual report card on what he called a ""phenomenal year"" for the company.

Michael Travia, managing director of fast-growing office productivity software group BOS GLOBAL Holdings (LON:BOS), has quit the company.

Atlantis Resources Limited (LON:ARL) noted that, as expected, its MeyGen Limited subsidiary was not awarded a 2071 contracts for difference allocation for renewable energy projects by the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS). However, the AIM-listed tidal power generation firm it has commenced a dialogue with BEIS officials to ""recognise the benefits of either a bi-lateral CfD discussion or the reintroduction of a marine energy sub-category in the next allocation round, either of which would be welcomed by Atlantis.""

Be Heard Group PLC (LON:BHRD) saw ""exceptional revenue growth"" in the first half and expects the growth rate to pick up in the second half.

Genedrive PLC (LON:GDR), the molecular diagnostics company, said its Genedrive HCV ID kit has achieved CE certification under the EU Medical Devices Directive.

Seeing Machines Limited (LON:SEE) saw like-for-like revenues soar once again last year and the eye-tracking technology specialist has now set its sights on turning over US$100mln by the end of 2019. Like-for-like sales more than doubled in the year ended 30 June to A$13.6mln (2016: A$6.1mln), driven by another strong performance from its Guardian fleet division.

Allergy Therapeutics PLC (LON:AGY) has strengthened its clinical research team with two senior appointments. Pieter-Jan de Kam joins as clinical director, while Simon Piggott will become head of clinical science.

Diversfied Gas & Oil PLC 's (LON:DCOG) production surged in the half year to June as the recent package of 1,300 wells in the US contributed for the first time.

Ortac Resources Ltd (LON:OTC) has announced that from henceforth it will focus on two gold projects in Africa held as investments, Casa Mining and Zamsort. The move follows the appointments of Nick von Schirnding and Brian McMaster to the board and the passing of all resolutions at an AGM last week.

8.20am ... AstraZeneca leading the way for the blue chips

The FTSE 100 has started the week in steady fashion, up 31.6 points to 7,409.2.

AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) is currently leading the way after it announced positive results from two separate Phase III trials of a couple of its key lung cancer drugs.

The Pacific trial of Imfinzi showed an improvement in progression-free survival by 11 months compared with standard of care in patients with locally-advanced unresectable lung cancer.

In the Flaura trial, Tagrisso reduced the risk of progression or death in patients with and without brain metastases by more than half.

Shares in the pharma giant jumped 3.1% shortly after the opening bell to £49.20 as Astra's stock continues to recover from the disappointing Mystic study results in July.

On the second tier, Carillion PLC (LON:CLLN) took another bashing after its finance director Zafar Kahn, along with a slew of other top executives, stepped down.

The boardroom shake-up comes just a couple of months after the construction and support services group initiated a strategic review following a shock profit warning.

AIM-quoted Jersey Oil and Gas PLC (LON:JOG) was struggling down in the minor leagues after striking out with its Statoil-operated exploration well.

The North Sea-focused explorer said drilling had showed the target reservoir to be water bearing and deeper-than-expected.

Investors had pinned a lot of hope on this particular target and shares collapsed by more than 80% as soon as the market opened to sit at 42p.

6.45am ... FTSE 100 seen higher at open

The FTSE 100 is seen opening higher following overnight gains in Asia as an easing of worries over the nuclear threat from North Korea offsets concerns about the impact of Hurricane Irma on the US state of Florida.

However some caution is also likely as investors await a key batch of UK data and the latest Bank of England policy meeting later this week.

Spread betting firm CMC Markets expects the FTSE 100 index to open around 28 points higher at 7,405 having closed 19 points lower on Friday.

On Friday, US markets ended mixed and fairly subdued, with the Dow Jones Industrials adding just 13 points at 21,797, while the broader S&P 500 index and tech-laden Nasdaq both ended modestly lower as investors waited to see what impact Hurricane Irma will have on Florida.

But Asian markets managed more substantive gains today as North Korea's leaders choose to party this weekend rather than launch more missiles. Japan's Nikkei 225 added over 1.3% helped also by a weaker yen versus the dollar which boosted exporters.

No important UK economic data will be released today - although inflation numbers come tomorrow and unemployment and average earnings will be released on Thursday - so the main focus will be on the week's early corporate news.

Primark sales eyed

Associated British Foods PLC (LON:ABF) should attract the most attention with blue chip food to clothing retail conglomerate issuing a fourth quarter trading update.

Conditions at the group's high street discount fashion chain Primark, as always, will be the main focus.

In a preview, analysts at JPMorgan said they expect Primark to deliver fourth quarter like-for-like sales growth of +2%, which would take the chain's full-year like-for-like increase to +1%.

Overall, they are forecasting Primark's full-year constant currency sales to grow by +13%, in line with the 9-month trend.

The analysts said: ""We expect management to reiterate its full year expectation for 'good growth' in group adjusted operating profit & EPS and forecast +20% & +17% yoy, respectively "".

They said they also expect AB Food's management to highlight some upside risk to Primark profitability if current euro strength is maintained.

And the analysts think recent currency moves should also be favourable for the firm's British Sugar business, although they added that they are mindful that, given a decline in the world sugar price, it is possible this simply offsets some underlying downside risk to current sugar forecasts.

Significant events expected on Monday September 11:

84,84,"SINGAPORE: Today's lovely tan could cause a wrinkle, dark spot or skin lesion in the near future. That golden glow is the body's signal that DNA damage has been done and it is hurt. Fortunately using a sun protection product before you head out in the sun can help with damage control, even more so when we live in the tropics.

WHAT ARE UV AND IR RAYS AND WHY ARE THEY HARMFUL TO OUR SKIN

The sun is literally a ball of light energy comprising many rays, including ultraviolet (UV) A and B. We need some for the body to make vitamin D (essential for good muscle and bone health), but not a lot. According to aesthetics doctor, Dr Georgia Lee from TLC Lifestyle, only 10 to 15 minutes of unprotected sunlight exposure every other day can help us produce sufficient vitamin D; it is just as easily gotten from a diet (fatty fish for example) and supplements, without increasing the risk of skin cancer.

Too much UV exposure and things go south. Not only do UVA and UVB rays up the risk of skin cancers, the nasty skin effects are more immediate. Dr Lee shared that UVA hits deeper into the skin, causing collagen fibre breakdown, bringing on wrinkles and sags. UVB rays hit the outermost layer of skin hardest, resulting in pigmentation and sunburns.

However, only three to five per cent of UV light reaches us from the sun. The bulk of the visible light that hits us on a daily basis, are Infra-Red (IR) rays (about 55 per cent). Recent research has shown their causal link to skin damage. Not great news since IR rays are omnipresent - they are also emitted from electronic devices like computers, phones or hairdryers.

Of the many IR rays, you should be most concerned about IR-A rays. They penetrate deeper into the skin, cause damage by producing free radicals and also appear to increase pigmentation, said Dr Joshua Chong, medical director at South Bridge Aesthetics. Free radicals are unstable oxygen molecules that steal electrons from your other healthy skin cells, hotwiring their proper functions and altering genetic material when they do. The more free radicals in the skin, the more damage wrecked and the faster we age.

Sunblocks and sunscreens protect from solar damage, but they work differently. The former, as explained by Dr Winston Lee (W Lee), also a medical director at South Bridge Aesthetics, uses ingredients like titanium dioxide or zinc oxide; they sit atop skin to form a physical barrier between you and the UVB rays to prevent sunburn.

Sunscreens have chemical filters like oxybenzone and octinoxate that penetrate the skin to absorb the UVA rays before they do deep skin damage. Today's sun protection products have a mix of both to shield you from UV damage. Dr Chong also added: ""Sunblock ingredients also have a protective effect against IFA rays, albeit a limited role.""

WHAT IS SPF AND WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN

Do look at the SPF numbers and PA plus ratings on the labels to decode protection. The SPF level indicates protection against sunburn. What this means is, the higher the SPF level, the greater the protection from UVB radiation. The PA plus ratings show UVA protection, with three pluses offering the most coverage. For our tropical climate, an SPF 30/PA++ product is what Dr Lee recommended. She said: ""When used correctly, and applied sufficiently, it offers up to 95-97 per cent protection from the harmful UV rays.""

Most people fail to apply enough cream, miss out spots or forget that reapplication is necessary after swimming or sweating in the sun.

The doctors reminded that a shot glass of product (about 30 grams) is ample to cover face and all exposed parts of the body. Sun protection should be applied 15 minutes before you leave the house (it allows the cream to settle in) and re-applied every two hours when outdoors or immediately after swimming or any activities that incurs perspiration.

They also warned that waterproof labels are a misnomer since no sun care product is 100 per cent waterproof, only water-resistant at best. Dr Lee said: ""For water sports, using water-resistant sunscreen will offer better protection but it is more occlusive to our skin pores and may not be suitable for daily usage.""

Do not forget areas like hands and legs or the hairline. ""The scalp needs sun protection as much as other parts of the body... studies show that hair alone is not adequate protection and the use of a water-based sunscreen is recommended, especially for the hairline,"" said Dr W Lee. He added that bald men are more prone to burns so caps or hats should be considered when out in the sun.

Young skin also need sun protection but it is better to limit unnecessary sun exposure when babies are under six months old. As a baby's skin is too thin and sensitive to chemicals, protective clothing and hats are a better shield. Infants that are older also do better with a chemical-free SPF. ""Cover them with cloths and hats; hydrate them well too,"" Dr Lee advised.

It is easy to fit sun care into a skincare regime. Formulas wear better on skin - they are less pasty, absorb fast and smell pleasant. They come in sprays and mists, and easy roll-ons so application is a cinch. Some even have a cosmetic function, doubling up as primers or complexion enhancers to get your face ready. Do note that makeup with sun protection should not be a replacement for sunscreen, but an additional layer of protection. This is especially so if they do not have the minimum SPF30 that doctors recommend.

Here are some sunscreens that can shield you from UVA and UVB rays, and minimise the free radical damage.

This non-greasy light mist is good for all skin types, including oily an acne prone skin. Plus, you can use it from head to toe. Bonus: It washes off with regular cleanser, no makeup remover needed.

Made for young, delicate skin, the formula is slightly tinted to make sure you don't miss a spot. Perfect for your little ones.

Perfect for on-the-go touch-ups, this portable stick fits easily into pockets, and is easy to use on your face, lips and the area around your eyes. It is also water-resistant too.

SUPERGOOP! ANTI-OXIDANT INFUSED SUNSCREEN MIST WITH VITAMIN C SPF50, $27

85,85,"Attorney General Avichai Mandleblit announced he is considering charging Sara Netanyahu with graft, fraud and breach of trust for alleged overspending of over $100,000 in public funds on private meals at the prime minister's official residence.

Netanyahu, whose husband has vigorously denied the allegations, will be asked to provide evidence as to why she should not be charged with fraud, fraudulently receiving goods under aggravated circumstances, and breach of trust.

Since winning his case against the Netanyahus, Naftali has been at the centre of weekly public protests against what he calls the prime minister's corruption and the failure of the attorney general to bring indictments against the Israeli leader in at least two cases now being investigated.

He said that both State Attorney Shai Nitzan and the Jerusalem District Attorney's Office had recommended an indictment. The third is the purchase of garden furniture for the official residence in Jerusalem and transferring it to the Netanyahu family's private home in Caesarea.

""This too will evaporate in the hearing"", Netanyahu wrote. ""In addition to her work as an educational psychologist, she spends a great deal of time helping children with cancer, Holocaust survivors and lone soldiers"".

Last Saturday, Sara Netanyahu released the results of a private lie detector test showing that she was telling the truth.

In the most high profile civil case, the Netanyahus former chief caretaker Meni Naftali successfully sued her for wrongful dismissal, alleging abusive and erratic behaviour.

Mandelblit is expected to level four separate charges against Sara Netanyahu.

Afterwards, the attorney-general will make a final decision as to whether or not to pursue further legal measures, according to the paper.

The Netanyahus have tried to blame Naftali for overspending. That says it all. Not only did the prime minister's wife not commit any offense, but the preoccupation with the food of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who works around the clock for the state and its security, and with the food of his family, is a pathetic and obsessive one.

The allegations have set up the freakish spectacle of Israel's most powerful political figure publicly and repeatedly denouncing his former caretaker, a former soldier and official bodyguard who had one of the highest levels of security clearance.

Charges against Netanyahu for these 15 instances are being closed by Mandelblit as there was insufficient evidence to prove that she knew about Seidoff's and the others' actions.

86,86,"Time and again, the abuse of mobile phones has been slammed by medics as well as experts who have sounded a warning against the misuse of these gadgets. Apart from the deadly online games that are taking young lives, the use of such gadgets for long hours can cause serious health issues, say experts. ""As a teacher and father if I have to identify the worst menace affecting the personality, social attitude and academic performance of students, I have no hesitation in saying it is the smartphones and social media,"" says Dr Syed Bashir Ahmad from the University of Nizwa.

""These devices are detrimental to the health of our societies. They have advantages too, but the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages.""

""We all need to ponder over how to control the use of these 'non-smart' devices,"" said Dr Ahmed, who has decades of experience interacting with students and has published several papers on diverse topics.

But the list of health issues associated with the overuse of mobile phones is endless.

""Some of these include eye-related problems, headaches and addiction among youngsters. For an increasing number of people, the cause of poor posture and backache is a result of spending too much time with heads and necks bent at unhealthy angles over their mobile phones,"" says Dr Nigel Kuriakose, Department of Anaesthesia and ICU, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital.

According to some studies, bending your head at a 60-degree angle to peer over a phone places 60 pounds of pressure on the cervical spine above the shoulders -- more than the weight of an average seven-year-old.

Researchers say this type of stress could result in the early wear and tear (degeneration) of parts of spine, which might even require surgery.

The recently published World Health Organisation Fact Sheet says that a person using a mobile phone 30-40 cm away from the body while texting and using the Internet will reduce the quantum of exposure to radio-frequency fields than someone holding the handset close.

Similarly, experts warn that excessive use of mobile phones is like living close to a mobile tower, which is tantamount to being in a life-sized microwave.

Normal/neutral posture means having the ears in line with the shoulders and the shoulders back and down. Yet, prolonged use of cell phones and computers flex the spine forward, which is stressful to the anatomy. It is thus important to correct our posture while using mobile phones.

""WhatsApp is a modern menace which has become something like a dog's collar. You are on a leash. Communication with others should be your need and not for others to disturb you all the time. Wish you could live without these gadgets,"" says Dr Shyam Bawikar, Public Health Adviser, Ministry of Health HQ, Oman.

Problems don't end there. Prolonged use of mobiles phones will cause serious health hazards, including sleep disturbances and cancer. These gadgets can lead to financial losses and, in extreme cases, even suicide, reveals a study.

Children's studies and other useful activities are also affected by mobile phones. It also makes them involve in ""unwanted activity"". The mobile phones also contribute to an unhealthy society as they reduce social interactions.

Last but not the least, a majority of road accidents (70 per cent) are because of the use of mobile phones while driving, according to the Royal Oman Police (ROP)."

So goes the clever ruse of con artists intent on scamming money from America's seniors. While Halloween season zombies and ghouls may be frightfully fun, tricking seniors out of their cash is alarmingly scary. Every year hucksters bilk almost $3 billion from older Americans, hatching increasingly elaborate plans to break into retirement nest eggs.

Criminals who prey on the elderly find the older generation more trusting and gullible, particularly those with cognitive challenges who typically believe the ""nice young man"" on the phone or on their doorstep. The Federal Bureau of Investigation notes that older Americans are less likely to report a fraud because they don't realize they've been taken advantage of financially or they fear their mental capacity or financial management ability will be in question by relatives. When elders do report a crime, the suspected criminals count on seniors' aging memory to affect the recollection of incident details.

""It's maddening to hear of so many criminal schemes that try to take advantage of our aging loved ones,"" said Darlene Bosco, Owner of Right at Home Jersey Shore. ""To help circumvent would-be scammers, it's important to stay engaged with our older relatives and friends and talk to them about common financial scams and ways to be cautious with their finances.""

Darlene, points out common fraud schemes against seniors, including the following:

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Imposter

The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reports at least 1.97 million Americans were targeted in 2016 for an IRS scam involving a swindler calling or showing up in person to threaten arrest if purported overdue taxes were not paid immediately. The crooks demand instant payment using a precise payment method such as a prepaid debit card or wire transfer. In most cases with overdue taxes, the IRS will mail several notice letters to taxpayers and not just call or drop by. The IRS will not ask for payment other than to the U.S. Treasury.

Telemarketing/Phone

According to the National Council on Aging, seniors make twice as many purchases over the phone than the national average. With no face-to-face engagement and no traceable paper trail, fake telemarketing crooks often escape detection. Popular telephone schemes include the ""help grandma"" jail-time ploy or fake hospitalization; or the caller who immediately asks, ""Can you hear me?"" -- the phone pirate wants to record the person's voiced ""yes"" reply to hack their private information in the future. Many companies rely on a voiced ""yes"" for access to security settings and account changes. With the ""Can you hear me?"" call, scam prevention experts recommend using another reply phrase such as ""I can hear you.""

Internet/Email/Phishing

Seniors tend to exhibit more limited internet skills and may not be aware of firewalls and built-in virus protection for their computers. Phishing is a cybercrime in which someone posing to be with a legitimate company attempts to lure personal information from unsuspecting individuals. Digital bandits count on people clicking on unsolicited emails and updating or verifying personal or financial information when a legitimate-looking company asks. Fraudulent emails allegedly from popular retailers and restaurants may invite individuals to click on a link, which then installs malware on the person's computer. Also, many elderly shop online for better prices for their medications, but can be duped by counterfeit prescription drug merchants.

Medical Identity Theft

Because U.S. citizens and permanent U.S. residents age 65 and older quality for Medicare, fraud artists may pose as Medicare representatives wanting to verify personal information. Some embezzlers will offer phony services at free public health fairs and will photocopy health insurance cards or ask participants to sign blank insurance claim forms.

Funeral and Cemetery

Some plunderers will read local obituaries and then show up at funerals pretending that the deceased owes them an outstanding debt. Capitalizing on the emotions of a grieving widow or widower, the scammer will try to extort funds from relatives to settle the bogus debt. Legal authorities warn about dishonest funeral homes that charge exorbitant prices for unnecessary funeral services or even faux caskets. Some thieves will sell prepaid funeral packages or cemetery plots with no intention of following through on the purchase transaction.

Counterfeit Tech Support

A growing consumer scam involves callers who pretend to be representatives from well-known technology companies like Microsoft and Apple. The thugs claim viruses have been detected on the person's computer, and the person is directed to go to a tech support website and follow its instructions. In the process, malware installs on the call recipient's computer to steal passwords and other personal identity information. The tech bandits then charge fees to remove the fake electronic viruses. Microsoft data shows that tech support cons in 2015 pilfered an average of $454 nearly every 10 seconds from unsuspecting Americans, many of them elderly.

Investment/Time-Shares

Investment scams like Bernie Madoff's financial pyramid scheme often target older adults who want to protect their cash for their later years. Other hucksters promise to resell time-shares, but first ask for money to front title fees and administrative costs.

Fake Charities, Sweepstakes and Lotteries

A number of swindlers hit below the financial belt by appealing to people's desire to help a cause, especially charities that reportedly help cancer patients, military veterans, endangered animals or any number of noble humanitarian projects. Other scams promise impressive cash prizes or exotic vacations as sweepstakes and lottery payouts, but first require paying taxes or a collection fee on the winnings.

Scams aimed at America's aging population may add a new gimmick here and there, but the bottom line is that the bad guys still want free and fast money. If you've been ripped off financially, some criminals will even plot a recovery or reload scam posing as a law enforcement agency or consumer group assigned to help you get your money back -- for a fee, of course.

How to Help Protect Seniors From Scams

Darlene suggests a number of steps to help safeguard seniors from scam bullies:

Make sure your senior's phone has caller ID and he or she knows how to screen unsolicited calls. Remind elders to not answer calls from unfamiliar phone numbers.

Advise older adults to not share personal information with strangers, especially common identifiers such as a mother's maiden name or birth date.

Become an authorized person on your senior's checking account and/or the second signature on the elder's checkbook.

Instruct seniors to never hand over medical ID cards or read off Social Security, Medicare or health insurance numbers to anyone they do not know or trust.

Direct elders to ask questions about and research any charity or company that asks for a donation or sells products. Charitynavigator.org is a reputable resource for investigating legitimate charities before making a financial contribution.

If a senior friend or relative is a victim of a scam, encourage them to report the incident to local police and talk to their bank or financial institution. The local area's Adult Protective Services may also provide counsel as well as the government-sponsored Eldercare Locator at 1-800-677-1116, www.eldercare.gov.

88,88,"People sometimes joke about having "" gaydar,"" or a special ability to identify someone's sexuality. However, a new study indicates that while you likely don't have the ability, Artificial Intelligence can detect homosexuality with a high rate of accuracy just from a person's face. Researchers at Stanford University used AI to determine sexual orientation for more than 35,000 facial images and compared the results against humans.

Using images from an online dating site based in the United States, the team downloaded 35,326 photos representing 14,776 gay and straight men and women. In a series of studies, they found that facial features of gay men and women appear to differ slightly, and that computers do a better job of picking up on these cues than humans.

""We show that faces contain much more information about sexual orientation than can be perceived and interpreted by the human brain,"" the authors write in the report.

Using an algorithm, computer software determined whether a male was straight or gay 81 percent of the time, while it fared slightly lower for women, only accurately predicting 71 percent of the cases. According to the researchers, certain parts of the face offered more insight into one's sexuality. In men, the nose, eyes, eyebrows, cheeks, hairline and chin were the most informative spots, while the nose, corners of the mouth, hair and neckline offered cues in women.

As background, the prenatal hormone theory suggests that there is a link between sexual orientation and one's physical facial structure, due to male babies being underexposed to certain hormones and females being overexposed in the womb.

Next, the team compared the computer's score against humans. Compared to machine, man was only able to detect whether males were gay 61 percent of the time and 54 percent of the time for female photos. It shouldn't be a surprise that computers are better at detecting sexuality than humans. As the researchers note in their paper, computers using deep nueral networks, DNN, are much better at performing visual tasks. Previous studies have shown that AI could be used to accurately predict skin cancer.

The researchers are quick to warn that perceiving more feminine or masculine features is not a good indicator of one's sexuality.

""First, the fact that the faces of gay men and lesbians are, on average gender atypical, does not imply that all gay men are more feminine than all heterosexual men, or that there are no gay men with extremely masculine facial features (and vice versa in the case of lesbians),"" they write. ""The differences in femininity observed in this study were subtle, spread across many facial features, and apparent only when examining averaged images of many faces.""

Instead of attempting to decipher the gender someone is attracted to, they believe this research can be used to highlight the importance of enhancing privacy and protection laws amid rapidly advancing technology.

The researchers definitely don't advise assuming a stranger's sexuality based on their looks, especially since according to their findings, there's a good chance you'll be wrong."

In the digital era, where technology has become central to everything we do, it's essential that enterprises adopt a digital mindset.

Think about some recent disruptions:

· Blurring boundaries across industries: companies that are digital by birth are versatile in morphing from one business area to another. Is Amazon today a retailer, an infrastructure provider or an entertainment company? Apple's range of products extend from computers and phones to TVs and watches. Services range from computing to payments to fitness.

· Impact of computing on Core Sciences: from physical and mathematical sciences to biological sciences and behavioural sciences. This has changed the way we consume scientific data and leverage scientific inventions. An interesting study by Google for example, claims that AI can help to diagnose cancer quicker than human doctors. Aside from the obvious patient benefits, imagine the potential impact of this more widely across the NHS, an organisation that is currently under considerable pressure.

· The digitisation of society: every smartphone user is a digital entity; every ""thing"" can be a digital entity with IoT. This is fundamentally changing the type of services that are in demand and can be provided to consumers. Gartner predicts that there will be 20.4 billion connected things by 2020, worldwide. Many customers no longer interact with brands in the physical world, but within digital frameworks, supported by a variety of devices, from smart phones to fitness trackers.

· The industrialisation of software and computing: It is no longer enough to maintain the systems of record in enterprises. Automation becomes an important part of computing, and data takes on a new dimension. Let me give you the example of Nationwide. Batch processing is vital to a financial institution such as Nationwide from both an end-user perspective, and from a regulatory one. Using ignio, TCS' AI platform, the world's largest building society has transformed its overnight batch processing. By creating a blueprint of batch systems, ignio enables quick and easy modelling and prediction of the impact of business or technology-level changes and events on batch systems.

Each of these trends is making ""going digital"" aspirational for any traditional business. But ""going digital"" isn't a case of simply updating your software; it requires a complete change in the mindset and culture of a company.

Despite many innovative initiatives, many large enterprises are stuck with paper based and analog systems; IT and OT are disconnected. The enterprise systems are islands. In fact, a study by Deloitte found that the majority of businesses are not yet ready to go digital. Ninety per cent of respondents anticipated that their industries will be disrupted by digital trends to a great or moderate extent, but only 44 per cent say their organisations are adequately preparing for the disruptions to come.

One way I like to illustrate a Digital Enterprise is through the idea of having a digital spine: an end to end continuum of core technologies, agile processes, security, privacy and a new kind of workplace.

Some approaches that can hasten the building of the digital spine are:

· Adopting agile technology and people practices, leading to an Enterprise Agile philosophy.

· Modernising legacy and building an Adaptive core.

· Creating an Enterprise API framework that can be used internally for Hackathons, and connect to the external ecosystems as well.

· Using Security, Privacy, Compliance to drive strategic advantage and not stopping with the minimum required governance.

· Creating a workplace of the future with enterprise social spaces; gamified learning,

With the current rejuvenation in Artificial Intelligence approaches, we have a good chance of using the data derived from digital systems in a useful way. An insights layer on top of the digital spine can lead business to a new era of computing. Insights, automation, mash up of different types of data can throw up new ideas for the business. This layer will leverage many components including:

· The IoT and domain specific advancements: For Example, genomics and metagenomics, behavioral sciences, often across industry boundaries, in data markets

· Predictive and prescriptive analytics

· Robotics and automation

Once an enterprise acquires a strong digital base and gains the means to generate predictive and prescriptive insights, it must focus on customer experience. It must develop an outside in perspective, often keeping the end consumer in mind. Processes that can help in this area are:

· Design of next generation customer experience

· Digital-physical interfaces using wearables and sensors

· Workplace of the future, for ITs internal customers

Just as the evolution of the vertebra created more powerful species in biological evolution, so I believe a digital spine will differentiate enterprises. With the analytics layer over this, enterprises will have an enormous level of insight. It then becomes easier to offer immersive and curated experiences for customers.

These are big changes for traditional businesses. Organisational culture has to change quite a bit. A recent report by Odgers Berndtson and Forrester, revealed that 79 per cent of company leaders do not currently believe they have the right culture in place to succeed. ""Traditional"" businesses must remember that they were pioneers once. They have legacy systems because they chose to move to computerisation early. Somewhere along the path of expansion and stabilisation, the appetite to take risk declines.

One framework I follow in order to create a culture of business innovation is of the ""Five Vs"". Visionary leadership, Variety of ideas, Vibrancy of culture, Value of innovation and Velocity of innovation.

If you have a strong leadership in place and a vibrant culture that encourages others to contribute ideas, this can only be a positive thing for innovation within an organisation. Velocity is an important concept too, it is often mistaken for the same as speed; but as well as speed, velocity requires direction in equal measure. Keeping all the Vs in focus enables the R&D arm of an enterprise pivotal to its success.

From the autonomous benefits of AI, to compliance, to the workplace of the future - digital is a powerful tool that is changing everything we do. Transformation requires commitment, investment and persistence but the benefits of going digital can be enormous.

OUR ELECTION QUESTIONS

QUESTION: In no more than 200 words, please describe the state of Rome City Schools.

SEIFERT: ""The RCS system is at a serious crossroads. There has been a lack of central leadership and adequate communication between the board, educators and parents. We must embrace the challenge of preparing our students to be successful in the new global economy. Our schools are known for excellent academics, as shown by the volume of AP scholars every year, but we must keep growing to remain relevant and on par with the jobs and careers out there waiting on our students. Our teachers are our biggest asset and have the ability to provide educational opportunities for each and every student regardless of background; teachers need the proper assets to be successful. I am a first-generation college student. (I watched, and cried, as my dad graduated from Kennesaw State at age 60.) We must meet these challenges not only for our kids' futures but for our own. We need to harness the energy of our students, utilize the wealth of knowledge and experience of our amazing teachers, and make every student believe that he or she can succeed in a big way in this world and the future to come.""

DIXON: ""The state of the Rome City Schools system is a constantly changing, ever improving system. This ensures the needs of the students will be met as they prepare to join the workforce or continue their education at a college or technical school. Changes take place in every aspect of our lives, some are planned and others are unplanned. Our school system is continuously changing to prepare the students to successfully meet the requirements needed to meet the demands they will be facing. The school board is always looking ahead, planning for the future so our students will be prepared to be successful in our ever-changing world.""

COLLINS: ""The state of Rome City Schools has shown outstanding rankings statewide in: our school climate rating, Advanced Placement Scholars, AP Stem Scholars, Spirit of Green Award, leader in athletics by winning the GHSA state football championship, winning awards in the arts for middle school band and high school band, jazz band, and concert band programs, as well as choral program. In addition, Rome City Schools has been named one of the Top Ten Digital School districts in GA and students from the nontraditional Phoenix Performance Learning Center (PLC) received the Georgia School Boards Association (GSBA) first place award in video contest. Rome City Schools has a commitment to maintaining high-standards for all students. Our school system displays continuous growth in the high school graduation rate, expanding the use of technology to increase student achievement.""

FISHER: ""I believe Rome City Schools are excellent schools, not necessarily because of the resources we have, but because of the quality of teachers and staff. I have enjoyed volunteering with RCS because I am impressed with its employees and the positive environment they create for our students. Great things are happening at the elementary, middle and high school levels. Rome High has 84 AP Scholars and a recent 92.8% graduation rate. Elm Street and North Heights are STEM certified schools. Rome Wolves won the 5A State Football Championship last year. There is just not enough space to list everything! I fully support the One Rome vision. We should work together to bring our students the best education possible and it absolutely starts at the beginning with kindergarten. I think Dr. Holland's commitment to not just Rome High but to all students and the community is energizing. I believe there is some room for improvement. Our schools need more resources and classroom space to keep instep with growing demands. I think RCS could also be better partners with community resources. We all want what is best for our students and we are stronger when we work together and communicate needs.""

EHRLER: ""Although we have serious problems to solve, I want to see Rome City Schools in the news more for the great things that are happening. And, there are definitely some great things going on in Rome City Schools. Just to name a few, State Superintendent Richard Woods recently visited North Heights Elementary to recognize the school for their STEM certification. He then visited Elm Street Elementary, also a STEM certified school, as one of only five winners of the Georgia Family-Friendly Partnership School (FFPS) Award. Since 2012, Rome High's graduation rates have topped the state average by some 9 to 15 percentage points. There is excitement in the air on fall Friday nights at Barron Stadium. We have areas for improvement as well. There are achievement gaps across groups of kids and our discipline issues are higher than they should be. Our teachers have insufficient resources and their time is overtaxed outside of the classroom. Our bus transportation problems definitely need to be tackled sooner rather than later. As a new school board member, I will ensure that these issues will be a focus during my term.""

SWANN: ""The graduation rate for Rome High School reached 93% in 2016. There were 84 Advanced Placement Scholars for 2017, with 5 National AP scholars. Rome High School has the 10th highest district scores on the SAT in Georgia. There are computers in every classroom, as well as smart boards. Under the Chromebook initiative, students in grades 3 thru 12 already have Chromebooks. Second graders will have them in October and first grade will have them by the end of the school year.""

HOWARD: ""I feel that the state of Rome City Schools is the following: Reading scores and comprehension levels must be increased with fun and hands-on activities among the primary grades, including Pre-K. New books and updated technology are needed for our children, faculty and staff. More space for a growing population in the schools is needed. Parental involvement and mentorship volunteers are needed in the schools. More school buses and qualified drivers are in dire need to transport our children to school and back home safely. A supported fund will allow economically challenged children to eat hot meals. A weekly incentive points system used to measure good behavior and academic improvements. I believe that it would decrease undesirable behavior in children. Air-Conditioning in the gyms and more security cameras throughout the school system. A strong program to prepare our students for college or opportunities for career development and placements. A workshop to help parents get their child ready for college with information on deadlines, financial aid, community service, references and recommendations.""

BEEMAN: ""The state of Rome City Schools lies in the hands of the community and citizens of Rome. Once individuals elect the Rome City School Board, they become our voices in the community. They determine practices for general policies for the school district that insure that the state guidelines are being met. During this process, the Board focus should be on implementing the best practices to ensure that all children who enter the public education system achieve at high levels and reach their full potential. Back in 1992, when the city decided to merge East Rome and West Rome High Schools together, their plan was to offer one superior combined school. The citizens and the community brought into the consolidation plan because they had faith and belief in the vision. Today, the student population is growing at a fast pace due to our academic excellence, fine arts, athletics, and extracurricular activities. However, we still have educational gaps between high achievers and low achievers within Rome City Schools. We still have facilities that cannot accommodate the growth of our quality academics, athletics, and arts. We need to reduce our class sizes and create new Pathways within a College and Career Academy.""

O'HARA: ""Rome City Schools has and continues to be one of the top systems in Georgia, thanks largely to what has been a dedicated and caring staff of teachers, all whom have the interests of their students in their hearts and minds. Those in the classroom who are tasked with the role as educators, have gone the extra mile to provide the pathways to success not only in the classroom setting, but outside of it as well. I have seen them first-hand as a substitute teacher, how they adapt to what seems to be ever-changing standards and milestones and continue to help the children achieve success. At this point of time, however, Rome City Schools appears to have entered a state of flux. In the past four years, we have seen constant changes throughout the system, from the superintendent on down. 'Change' has been the optimum word lately and, naturally, with changes, those involved tend to land on opposite sides of the issue. Yet I'm certain that the changes will not deter what this diverse community seeks, and certain RCS will emerge even stronger.""

DAVIS: ""The Rome City Schools stand on a rich and diverse history that includes overcoming challenges of the past with great success; yet again we stand at a crossroads. This is the uphill climb that we adults know as life. Children who are successful in life personally and professionally demonstrate a characteristic known as a growth mindset. It involves taking chances and not being afraid to fail and start again. We know this builds resiliency in children! Success is built over time as we learn from mistakes. The Rome City Schools stand at a crossroads with mistakes having been made in the past. Relationships and trust have broken down. We need to stand with children and with each other. We need to encourage and support excellence in our teachers and students. We need character-filled leaders in our school, on the playing field, and in our community. Big problems do not always require complex solutions. Let's build relationships and be interested in the needs of others who may have a different and valuable viewpoint. I believe we stand on the brink of great opportunity!""

ROACH: ""It is obvious that the system has much to be proud of. A couple things that stand out: last year, the graduation rate was 92.8%, which is 13 points higher than the state average; and Rome City Schools was named best school district in Georgia Niche Rankings. There have been achievements on all levels, elementary, middle and high schools in both educational and extracurricular activities. Overall, I think Rome has a great school system, but needs to focus on teacher morale.""

JACKSON: ""One characteristic of a great school system is proactive leadership. The Rome City Schools are in the midst of leadership change with a new school superintendent, assistant superintendent and a new principal at Rome High and Annie K. Davie. This change is necessary to establish a sense of order, continuity and direction in the administration of our schools. With these recent changes, the state of the school system looks promising. This has been lacking over the past years with three principals at Rome High in four years and the same in school superintendent. Some of this responsibility is due to the make-up of the current School Board. This is one of their most important duties. The selection of a dynamic and proactive leader whose single focus is creating a school system of excellence dedicated to the education of our most precious resource, our children. In retrospect the question must be asked, did the candidates under consideration have the desire to roll-up their sleeves and go to work? Was their loyalty first to the city of Rome's Schools? This is where their heart should be. As a result of proactive leadership in administration, there has been increased enrollment in the system.""

ULDRICK: ""Rome City Schools has experienced transition in the past four years. The turnover in system leadership has created unease in the community and among RCS teachers. A system that was known for its stability suddenly had hints of unrest and uncertainty. During this time, teachers pressed on, doing what was right for students, no matter whose name was on the letterhead. That describes Rome City Schools to me -- doing what's right for students, even in times of uncertainty. Put students first, and you can never go wrong. Through times of change, teachers have always pushed forward to provide students with meaningful learning experiences, whether it is through STEM certification, the creation of ASPIRE elementary after-school programs, or the many accomplishments of our middle and high school. Rome High School winning the state championship was a crowning achievement for an athletic program in need of a boost. A more important milestone for Rome High was the 84 AP Scholars that they boasted last year! Rome City Schools' teachers, administrators, parents, and students should feel proud of their school system, while realizing that more work needs to be done to prioritize our needs and focus on ensuring that every student succeeds.""

MCDOWELL: ""The Rome City School System ranks above many of its counterparts in Georgia. Its mission that all Rome High graduates be prepared for college or work is both appropriate and attainable. Its recognition of the role that the Arts plays toward achieving that mission is laudable in a time when other school systems are abandoning that foundation. The impressive variety of academic, athletic and extracurricular programming that is available allows interested students to literally pave any path that they wish toward a future that they seek. And the teachers that I've had the pleasure of working with are talented educators with a passion for tapping the potential of their students. Of course, there are also opportunities for improvement. Like most public school systems, Rome students are poorly served by state and national mandated testing requirements. Inadequate classroom space continues to hinder optimal instruction. And, the number of years that our teachers remain in the classroom tends to follow low national norms. As a Board member, I can work to address these challenges. But the positives far exceed the problems, and I look forward to leading in such an already successful system.""

BYINGTON: ""I'm thrilled about where we stand and I have all positive expectations about what's to come. We were recently named 16th best school district in the state by Niche Rankings. Our graduation rate is 93% and we had 84 Advanced Placement Scholars, as well as five National AP Scholars. Participation in our award-winning Sound of the Seven Hills marching band is at a high and we have added a very popular show choir to our already acclaimed vocal program. Two of our elementary schools received STEM certification and our athletic programs have brought home playoff appearances, playoff wins, and region and state championships. We have an excellent administrative team in place and our central office is fully staffed with talented leaders who are preparing us for an outstanding future. Dr. Brittney Wilson has joined us as Assistant Superintendent. Dr. Wilson' understanding of career and technical education will help us further prepare our students for life after graduation. Tashia Twyman, our new Student Support and Community Outreach Specialist, is already building relationships between students and community mentors. Our vision is for RCS to be the best system in the State and our leaders are poised to take us there.""

QUESTION: An independent college and career academy based at Rome High, a field house and other athletics improvements, the Main/North Heights projects and the county schools projects: How will you vote on Nov. 7 on the latest extension of the 1-cent education tax and why?

SEIFERT: ""After research and consulting with Rome/Floyd Citizens for Better Schools, I still have questions. Extending the current ELOST is an excellent opportunity to benefit our schools, with potential game-changers as far as projects. However, there is still work to be done and questions to be answered. This proposal provides our community with an opportunity to participate in some collaborative leadership where both City and County can have a voice and all our students benefit. My kids are a year apart, and I just spent two consecutive years with sixth graders at West End. The idea of a sixth grade academy is appealing to me but I do have questions regarding logistics. Also, the second-tier projects aren't as flashy or exciting but are very much needed. For example, one project is equipping all the elementary school gyms with air-conditioning. I've spent the last eight years sweating through PTO programs and school dances in the West End Gym, so this highly appealing to me. My point is: Don't throw the baby out with the bath water...if you aren't 100% on board with one proposal project. ELOST can, with some work, benefit all our students in all our schools.""

DIXON: ""I will vote YES. Our school systems (both city and county) need the money to make improvements in existing school buildings and to build new schools. As a result of state funds being constantly cut and citizens being taxed beyond their means, our school systems need this money to improve existing facilities and to build needed new facilities.""

COLLINS: ""I will vote for the extension of the 1-cent education tax because of my concern about meeting the needs of all students. As an innovative thinker, I can envision the future of our school system. We cannot lose sight of totally focusing on the best for our students. The division of buildings at the previous Main Elementary School site and the open campus had always been a security concern. It is definitely time to make absolutely sure that our faculty and students are placed in a safe/secure school environment. The new Main Elementary School will provide an opportunity for the education of Main Elementary students in Pre-K to 5th grades to be safely under one roof in one location. The changing of North Heights to a STEM Academy serving all of Rome City 6th grade students will further promote a strong STEM education to develop ideas and make discoveries through instruction in STEM programs. The College and Career Academy based at Rome High will be a showcase for education and workforce development. It will serve all students with a seamless transition to post-secondary opportunities. The multipurpose building which will house the athletic department will be used for many activities.""

FISHER: ""I will be voting yes for ELOST on Nov. 7. I recently toured RHS during the school day while it was in full operation and the school, while pristine, is over 25 years old. There is simply not enough space for their needs. RHS has over 200 additional students this year than last. If we don't have plans to address this, what will our school be like in five years? There is no question that RHS athletic facilities are cramped and inadequate. A field house and athletic improvements would benefit all of our athletes. The plan to merge all 6th graders and create the 6th Grade STEAM Academy would have incredible benefits for not only 6th grade students, but also for the students at the elementary schools because it frees up more classroom space. It's about time...our elementary students need air conditioning in the gymnasiums. They are returning to school in July and it is unreasonable to expect them to thrive in such hot conditions. The county school projects are exciting too. Pepperell Middle and Armuchee need these improvements. I completely support investing in our city and county schools and I believe ELOST is important to pass in November.""

EHRLER: ""I will be voting for the extension of the 1-cent education tax (ELOST). Rome is in the beginning phase of growth, both in terms of student population and need for diversity in the curricula at our schools. This year alone, Rome City Schools has had a significant increase in student enrollment. We need more room. We need to move 6th grade out of the elementary schools. The statistics are also very clear that, while traditional college is the dream of many, technical tracks have employment and income potentials that can equal or exceed the potential for some jobs requiring a traditional college degree. Rome has a need for technical specialists. We have a need for the ELOST to pass in order for our schools to grow in the way they need to grow.""

SWANN: ""The College and Career Academy will offer a lot of opportunities for our high school students. They will be exposed to future career options. The main advantage is having the Academy right on campus. We definitely need to upgrade our athletic departments for all our sports teams. The new Main Elementary School building will be a sense of pride for the students. Turning North Heights into a Sixth Grade Academy will allow all of our sixth-grade students to be together to meet new friends and to get prepared for middle school. I will definitely vote YES on November 7th. As long as I have been on the Board, I have always said, 'It's all about the kids.'""

HOWARD: ""I will do more research on the 1-cent education tax, but based on what I have heard, it would be used to improve or expand county and city schools' current conditions that would allow our students to learn more effectively.""

BEEMAN: ""I am so excited about the possibility that we may soon have an independent college and career academy based at Rome High School to benefit the Rome City students. My vote will be a resounding 'yes' to the ELOST. My reasoning is because Rome High is currently the only high school in the local area that does not have a facility that will accommodate a Career Pathway program that is accessible to all our Rome High students. When it comes to collaboration between Rome City and Floyd County high schools, transportation remains an issue that interferes with instructional time and the safety of a Career Pathways Program located off site for both high schools.""

O'HARA: ""The projects on the proposed ELOST is set in stone. There is little myself or any other of those seeking a seat on the Rome School Board can do to change it. I have always been a fervent supporter of projects that benefit our children, although there have been some proposals that seemed out of place and inadvisable. I have, however, always supported ELOST projects and will continue to do so as I feel the community needs to continually provide the resources that give our students and teachers every possible opportunity to be successful. Still, it is vital for a School Board to be transparent in seeking extensions of education taxes to make sure the community understands the importance of why all of the projects are needed to adhere RCS' sole mission - Education - and does not benefit non-educational programs.""

DAVIS: ""I will vote 'yes' on the latest extension of the 1-cent education tax. I see this as an opportunity to stand with our children and invest in them. I believe much of the concern from the community revolves around allocation of funds. We need leaders who will make future decisions with a balanced, educated perspective, who stand first with the child and endorse excellence in academics, excellence in arts, and excellence in athletics. As allocation decisions are made, we must model the creative and critical thinking skills that are imperative for our students. We must look out for the interests of others, not just our own. We are neighbors together in the Rome City Schools.""

ROACH: ""Projects need to be funded in order to maintain an educational environment in which our children can thrive. I have attended meetings and had discussion with committee members on the projects up for approval on the Nov. 7 ballot. Before I finalize my decision, I wish to get feedback from a variety of people in the community. A vote 'yes' means we all share the cost with 40% of the money collected coming from people that do not live in the county. A vote 'no' means the burden will be on property owners. If I voted today, the decision would be simple, because youth are our most valuable investment and everyone needs to support their future.""

JACKSON: ""I will vote YES in November for the extension of the one cent education tax. Regardless of whom one supports in the School Board election, I hope you will give a thumbs up for the approval of the tax extension (ELOST) to fund these much-needed projects. A good, safe, and advanced learning environment is essential for the students in our education system. Each of the projects is worthwhile, but one small expenditure to increase the safety of our children while at school is worth the peace of mind it achieves for parents. Whatever the cost of installing security cameras, and other advanced security technology, at every entrance and exit in every school in the system pales in comparison to the value of one life saved. Another example of the many things we can provide to enhance the learning of our children is the creation of the planned STEAM academy for sixth graders. This school will focus on teaching our sixth-grade children in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics. This will better prepare them for a successful and fulfilling life.""

ULDRICK: ""I will vote 'yes' the ELOST on Nov. 7. I am proud to be a part of a community that is forward-thinking, and I believe these types of taxes promote growth in infrastructure and planning that cannot be accomplished outside of the collection of those funds. Enrollment in each of Rome City's eight schools continues to climb, and many schools are out of classroom space. As a result, class sizes have grown. The creation of a Sixth Grade Academy through ELOST funds will create the much needed space that many elementary schools need. The creation of a College and Career Academy at Rome High School will only serve to prepare students for the many technical and career opportunities that do not necessarily require a four-year college degree. Are there things in the education tax that I would lay out in a different way? Sure! However, I do not believe in punishing students and their future growth because of decisions adults have made for them.""

MCDOWELL: ""The mission of Rome City Schools to ensure that all graduates are prepared for college or work would be brilliantly supported with a College and Career Academy. Currently, our county students are benefiting tremendously from a very successful academy of their own. Ideally, I would like to see our two systems pool their efforts to create a single College and Career Academy that would serve all students. This would minimize administrative costs while allowing our community partners to work with all students without duplicating their efforts. That said, I would rather see a separate academy at Rome than none at all. As for the other projects listed above, I believe the Main/North Heights proposals are novel solutions to the space allocation problem, and that these projects align nicely with the RCS mission. I know less about the field house project. All said, our students would be well served by the realization of these projects. I will enthusiastically vote 'yes' for the ELOST extension in November.""

BYINGTON: ""I support the proposed ELOST package and my reasons go beyond the benefits to the city school system alone. Placing a College and Career Academy at Rome High is the right move. It's imperative we prepare our students for a challenging job market and the CCA will help us do that by introducing them to a variety of career paths and teaching the marketable job skills needed in today's market. As enrollment increases, so does participation in our athletic program, making it increasingly important that we improve our athletic facilities. It's also important to note that the multipurpose indoor facility will be a great for all students, not just athletes. The facility will be used for physical education classes, ROTC Training, band/color guard, fine arts programs, and other special events. The consolidation of Main and North Heights Elementary will not only provide our students with a state-of-the-art facility, it will allow us to more efficiently manage our resources. I feel the same about Floyd County's decision to build a new Pepperell Middle School and renovate Armuchee High School. I will vote yes for the ELOST package because I believe it is best for all students in Rome and Floyd County.""

QUESTION: We've seen three superintendents in four years, three principals at Rome High in that same period and sweeping departures in Rome High athletics with rumblings of teacher turnover next. How would you help stabilize and improve the administration of Rome City Schools?

SEIFERT: ""I've noted, as a parent, some divisiveness in our community...a sense of 'us' vs. 'them'. There is a lack of transparency and appears to be little consistent central leadership. We need delegation and involvement of those who are actually 'in the know' - that is, the teachers and the parents. I want to bring transparency and accountability to the Board when it comes to communication and giving the community a voice. The Board's meetings and agenda items should be published in advance for the public and for parents and teachers who have a vested interest and want to make their voice heard. Stabilization is achieved by communication, and centralized, accurate, and congruent communication has been lacking. I initially decided to run for the Board because, despite my attendance at monthly board meetings, I rarely know the agenda items in advance and have never been offered an opportunity to weigh in as a parent on any issue. Parents and educators should have a seat at the table and a voice before the Board. I have the leadership experience to move this school system forward with stability, teamwork, and spirit.""

DIXON: ""Educators leave positions in a school system for a variety of reasons. The superintendent and school administrators are best suited to encourage retention and to select the most qualified candidates to fill vacancies. The school board should set long term goals to meet the needs of students. They should work with the superintendent and school administrators as necessary to accomplish those goals.""

COLLINS: ""The stabilization of the administration is a cooperative effort beginning with collaboration with the Board of Education and the Superintendent. It is the intent of the Board to work for the best for students in everything we do. As a consensus builder, I believe I can help guide our Board to reach common ground on issues of concern. We must focus on recruitment and retaining highly qualified and capable staff. We must build communication and understanding with employees, parents, and stakeholders.""

FISHER: ""Three superintendents in four years and three principals at RHS is a lot of change. Of course, retirement was a catalyst for some of the changes. Anna K Davie, Rome Middle, and Rome High School each have new principals this year and I support their visions for our students. Going forward, a school board member's role is to hold the superintendent accountable for the quality of the leadership and our school system. The school board is designed as a check and balance for the school system and it also sets policy. As a school board member, my goal is to uphold the high-standards that Rome expects from its schools and do what is best for all of our students, staff, and community. The school board is also responsible for budget oversight. RCS must be responsible financial stewards of your tax dollars. My background as a chemical engineer provides unique experience in evaluating and optimizing the financial relationship between the school system and community members. As a parent with three in each level in the school system, I definitely have a finger on the pulse of our school system. I am personally invested in Rome City Schools and its success.""

EHRLER: You can't hide dysfunction in a school system. While energy and motivation is contagious among educators, so is the opposite. Typically, the main leadership problems that contribute to the loss of top teachers is breach of trust, lack of consistency, ineffective communication, lack of vision, or all of those factors combined. Building the trust with our teachers and the community is a long process, and we cannot move forward without it. As a new school board member, it will be my commitment to ensure that the only issue on the table will be the well-being and education of our children. Secondly, building trust requires greater transparency in communication. This means more public discussion of issues than what we have seen before. Thirdly, it will be my commitment to ensure that our system's leadership maintains integrity and competence at the highest level, conducts business fairly and consistently and communicates with teachers and the community with a clear and positive vision.""

SWANN: ""I feel that our current superintendent, Louis Byars, is doing a great job of bringing stability to our schools. He is hiring great personnel throughout the system, from teachers and principals to the assistant superintendent. I have great confidence in him and will support his decisions.""

HOWARD: ""I feel that the turnover of employees is behind us as we move forward and we have well-qualified administration hired by the previous School Board. A job well done! We could implement an incentives program on a professional level that would match high standard performance; it would help stabilize our teachers, staff, and administration. Offer (1) winter and (1) summer retreat at a bonus location for the persons with the most points on their evaluation.""

BEEMAN: ""Our number one problem with the turnover at our school is some people are just not willing to buy into the bigger picture that Rome High is advancing into the 21st century. We cannot stay in the same era because 'we have moved into a new era.' Anytime there is a shift in management, there will be a shift in morale and vacancies. And one must ask why some are not willing to give the new administrators a fair chance? We have seen three Superintendents in the past two years because one of our retired and went back to his hometown; another moved on to manage a higher paying educational institution. The key words here are retired, went home, and moved on, which equals life choices. However, our current Superintendent is truly vested in Rome. He graduated from a local high school, lives in Rome, and will probably retire in Rome. I am confident the system got it right; because Mr. Byars is smart, stable, vested, and most importantly 'his primary focus is all about the educational advancement of our children'! I understand the concern that is being expressed because we have had three principals in the past three years.""

O'HARA: ""There is no question that the makeup of Rome City Schools has gone through noticeable changes in the past several years, as I addressed in a previous question about the state of RCS. Maintaining the stability of a school system is the responsibility of the School Board and currently, due to the on-going changes the system has experienced, many are questioning the stability. Changes take place in all walks of life - adapting to such changes, especially within the context of education, can however be difficult, and in the long run, costly. I believe it is the responsibility of a school board to make sure the system remains stable especially when change takes place. One must understand, however, that it is not a board's responsibility to run the schools. That is what the superintendent is charged to do and, in turn, the board must determine if the leadership is accountable in reaching the goals and executing the policies established by the board.""

DAVIS: ""I understand there is much concern over the recent turnover at Rome High School in the leadership roles, as I listen to our community. What is the answer? I believe relationships are the key in life. It truly matters how students treat one another; it matters how our administration treats teachers; it matters how I treat you. First, we need to build relationships. Then we need to be willing to explore the most effective ways of reaching students, not simply continuing a process that may not be effective. Learning should be exciting and creative and concept-oriented. We need students who are encouraged to think critically. This process starts with a leadership team who will not just follow former procedures that may not be effective, but instead look for what is working and what is proven effective. We need leaders who will think outside the box and value their team members. We expect excellence in our schools. The stabilization will come from working together as an effective, integrated, thriving team to truly make a difference in students' lives.""

ROACH: ""After witnessing so much instability in the two most important leadership positions, it is imperative the Board be supportive of all decisions that are in the best interest of the students and their education. These are some of the problems that make it absolutely essential to have educators with classroom experience on the Board. We can relate and provide valuable insight to the needs of the faculty, administration and students. If there are rumblings of teacher turnover, teachers need to be involved in expressing their concerns and working together with the administration to improve morale. It is called teamwork.""

JACKSON: ""The constant changing of the guard at the helm of the Rome City School System, and of RHS, over the last four years created unfounded rumors of upheaval and unrest, harming the public image and confidence in the city's schools. At such times, the truth is not nearly as interesting in the telling as the often, baseless stories overheard in next table conversations. This atmosphere of distraction and distrust overshadowed much good work by our dedicated teachers who found it more than frustrating when they found no one to assist them in maintaining order in an overcrowded classroom. The support they needed when the going got tough was nowhere to be found. There was a leadership void and the classroom teacher was often on his or her own. Voters of the City of Rome must make sure the entire Board of Education is populated with individuals who are sound decision-makers and have, as their primary motivation, the welfare of our children. Our children and grandchildren are our future. They must be our first priority.""

ULDRICK: ""Stability in any system is important. Organizations that experience as much turnover as RCS has these past four years have a hard time finding a steadfast center. I believe that with measured investment, time and positive energy, Rome City Schools will see both growth and stabilization from the top down. My part in that would be to engage students, parents, teachers and administrators and hear their concerns about the challenges their students face. I think it's important to fully hear their suggestions for improvement. Thoughtful decisions need to be made in the best interests of all students, and I would not take that responsibility lightly. I also believe that we should lean into the gifted teachers we have hired and provide them with the resources and space to do their job. At the heart of it all needs to be the students. Every student in the Rome City System are my 'why'. No political capital is too big, and no person is too important if their decision-making jeopardizes what is right for the students first.""

MCDOWELL: ""This is a difficult and leading question. Turnover is a healthy part of any organization. That said, the turnover rate in Rome's administration and athletics seems to have been unusually high recently. Because I was not involved in the personal decisions that led these people to leave RCS, I cannot comment on a cause. And, it would certainly be inappropriate to speculate on a teacher exodus that has not yet happened. The key to building a strong and stable administration lies, first, in attracting a large pool of highly-qualified candidates for each open administrative position. (To cite a theatre analogy, a well-attended audition leads to a great show.) From the strong pool, hire the candidate who most strongly buys into - and who can best achieve - the mission of the Rome City Schools to ensure that every graduate of Rome High be prepared for college or work. When you hire the right person for the right job for the right reasons, stability and improvement will follow.""

BYINGTON: ""I believe we are well on our way to not only stabilizing but also strengthening our system's administration. There's an energy and excitement in our board office, as well as in our schools, and we are confident that the leadership we currently have in place at each level is as passionate about the success of our system as we are as a school board. We want all of our employees, regardless of their position, to be excited to walk through our doors each day, but we also recognize that other opportunities present themselves. When that happens, it's our responsibility to fill each position with the most talented and best qualified individual for the job and we believe we've done that and will continue to do so. Mr. Byars, Dr. Wilson and Dr. Holland are excellent examples of our success in these personnel decisions.""

QUESTION: Technology has surged to a point where it needs to be branded with the traditional 3 Rs. Where do you see Rome City Schools in terms of technological achievements by 2021, the year you would stand for re-election?

SEIFERT: ""My kids have been the beneficiaries of many of the technological advances our schools have made over the past several years including Chromebooks on a 1:1 ratio, SmartBoards in classrooms, utilization of online cloud-based learning modules, and several others. We need to keep moving forward in order to best prepare each of our students for success in the global technology-based economy. The best advisors in this area would be our teachers, as they know how students can best thrive in the classroom with constantly changing technology. Having cutting edge technology is great, but only if our teachers are given input as well as the resources and instruction necessary for maximizing its effectiveness. I suggest forming an advisory committee led by educators to make recommendations for specific needs that, if met, will facilitate the best classroom experience. Our teachers (our greatest asset) are our 'boots on the ground', being in the classroom every day, meeting educational challenges head on. In 2021, I will have a junior and a senior at Rome High, and I expect them to be technologically prepared for whatever future they choose in the every-advancing global economy.""

DIXON: ""Computers will be the key component of classroom teaching in coming years. We must plan to utilize technology to the maximum in making certain every student is able to read, write and compute at their grade level as they progress through the system from kindergarten to graduation.""

COLLINS: ""In terms of technological achievements in the traditional 3 Rs, as we look toward our 2020 vision, we can observe all students developing critical, creative thinking and problem solving skills, and the continued increase in technology at all grade levels. I see greater productivity and leaps in educational achievements through STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) certification and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) certification is being incorporated into classrooms throughout our school system.""

FISHER: ""Technology is constantly advancing, and it is a challenge to stay current. As it is incorporated more into the school curriculum, technology is allowing students to learn in independent and creative ways. Our curriculums are changing as well, as we concentrate on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) methodology that will better prepare our students. ELOST, if passed, would build a 6th Grade STEAM Academy at North Heights and it would be a state-of-the-art facility. I believe this would be a tremendous achievement for Rome City Schools. ELOST would also make a 1:1 Chromebook to student ratio beginning in 2nd grade. Our students are expected to take Georgia Milestones tests online in 3rd grade. Technology will not replace the personal instruction teachers provide, but it certainly enhances the tools teachers have available. By 2021, I see a strong school board that understands graduation is not an endpoint, but rather a milestone for all students. Our students need to be prepared to tackle evolving technology in order to compete for top spots in secondary education and employment after graduation. The Rome City School system must stay committed to providing and expanding opportunities for career exploration before graduation.""

EHRLER: ""Why is instructional technology so important? Because today, students no longer learn 7 hours a day. They collaborate with peers, create and share ideas and research 24 hours a day through phones, tablets and laptops. Like it or not, students learn best through technology. Rome City Schools has an incredibly competent technology department that readily and successfully adapts to, and evolved with, the ever-changing digital landscape. Several of our schools have initiated STEM programs as fantastic starting points for incorporating technology concepts with instruction. But, our schools are truly in need of better instructional resources that fully take advantage of the technology we have. As a school board member, I will ensure that our yearly goals will include greater emphasis on bringing instruction and technology together through initiatives like the STEM program and the development of partnerships with technology leaders. It is also time for Rome City Schools to merge our technology and teaching resources into a combined EdTech department in order to serve as a comprehensive resource to better enhance teaching and learning.""

SWANN: ""There will be more STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) related programs to include computers and Chromebooks. There will also be more hands-on technology, such as robotics.""

HOWARD: ""It's true that reading, writing and arithmetic are basic tools needed to navigate the world of technology. The art of reading, understanding what you read, your speed and vocabulary must be developed. Writing demonstrates spelling, grammar, structure of the written word and eye coordination that can improve with progressive reading techniques. Arithmetic are numbers, science, formulas, equations, and yes, reading. Let's improve those areas of our children's education and the will excel in the technology, as it rapidly changes. The school system will be equipped with programs, IT personnel and devices to teach those skills needed to achieve high tech performance.""

BEEMAN: ""Technology has surged to a point where it needs to be branded with the traditional 3 R's. I see Rome City Schools in terms of technological achievements by 2021 as a school that molds technology leaders in our community. Rome High students will be so computer savvy, that their backup plan to restore the loss or use of their computer hardware will be extremely easy. Once their Chromebooks reach its useful life, they will be able to recycle them. Our Rome High School students will have grasped the reusable gift giving by donating their old computers to a charitable or non-profit organization.""

O'HARA: ""Without a doubt, making sure the educational system keeps up with the remarkable technological changes that are taking place is vital. Preparing future generations to become productive people in an ever-changing world, in which technology is part of everyday life, is a must for school systems. We must, however, be aware that even more technological advances will be made down the road and be ready to adapt to new technology ideas and methods as they take place. At the same time, I feel we must make sure that the increasing roll of technology in education does not overshadow the 'traditional 3 Rs.' It must be incorporated into the traditional educational core.""

DAVIS: ""Technology is a critical piece within our students' education. We need to invest in the brightest and best in training and implementation for both our teachers and our students. We need to explore what the most technologically advanced schools are doing. I believe in going and observing, researching and weighing the evidence. We must be willing to invest our dollars in the education of our students, which includes providing the most up-to-date technology. As we go, it is paramount that we teach students to think critically; technology will change over the years. Employers like myself are looking for those who can problem solve and think critically. Security and safety are extremely important for our students in the area of technology.""

ROACH: ""Rome is already having students use more technology in the classroom, so by the year 2021, I would anticipate the system to be in the top 20% of Georgia.""

JACKSON: ""To refer to technology as ""changing"" is to use too feeble a word. There is no way to overstate how rapidly the latest tech tool will be outdated. As our local Chamber of Commerce seeks to attract new industry, we have to focus on providing a qualified workforce, and technology is key to the workforce of the future. This fact demands that our public schools be a laboratory of technology training to keep up with the needs of industry. Our schools must provide instruction in the use of modern and up-to-date technology. This will give our children a chance to compete with students from around the globe for jobs and careers in what is likely to be critical to success in business and industry far into the future. By 2021, I expect to see each and every teacher have direct and personal access to technology as a tool for instruction or whatever its successor technology might be. Whatever the newest and best technological tool should be in 2021, it would be my goal to see Rome City Schools far ahead of the pack in the acquisition and use of such tools of learning.""

ULDRICK: ""I've just poured through a powerful article published in the September issue of The Atlantic, entitled 'Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation' by Jean M. Twenge. Twenge outlines the real consequences of a generation she calls iGen. She says there's a mental health crisis among technological teens. 'Rates of teen depression and suicide have skyrocketed since 2011. It's not an exaggeration to describe iGen as being on the brink of the worst mental-health crisis in decades. Much of this deterioration can be traced to their phones.' I think that Rome City Schools should continue to incorporate technology in the classroom and find new avenues of learning for every student's preferred learning style. However, that cannot be the only focus. We must balance that technological progress with a focus on character education and service learning, both of which are important components of being a well-rounded student. The system would also benefit from having instructional technologists that support teachers in their efforts to implement the use of equipment purchased by the system and those resources/workers are not available now.""

MCDOWELL: ""Currently, student computing devices are used primarily for preparation and execution of online testing required by the state. While this might be a practical application for technology, it clearly lacks educational significance. Instead, we need to focus our attention on using technology in pedagogically appropriate ways that support the RCS mission. To my knowledge, RCS currently has no technology curriculum in place across all grade levels in most schools. If elected, I would like to lead a study of what such a curriculum should look like. Putting such a curriculum in place by 2021 would certainly be a significant technological achievement.""

BYINGTON: ""Technology is changing and improving at an exponential pace making it difficult to predict what the next four years might bring, but as a board and a system, we are being proactive regarding technology and I value its benefits to our curriculum. Knowing that industry drives technological advances, it's important that we continue to build relationships with business partners throughout our region, such as those that Mrs. Twyman is currently developing, as well as those that will grow from our College and Career Academy. It's critical that we develop a technology program that provides the resources our students need in the classroom today as well as prepares them for success beyond graduation.""

QUESTION: The most important thing to happen to Rome City Schools in the next four years will be what?

SEIFERT: ""Progress. We can achieve progress through increased participation of parents, educators and the community. Progress must be achieved through transparency and accountability. Most importantly, progress is essential in preparing Rome City School students to be successful in higher education and in the ever-changing global job market.""

DIXON: ""The most important thing to happen in the next four years is to ensure that our teachers have all the skills and equipment needed to educate our students in order for them to be successful in our ever-changing world.""

COLLINS: ""The most important thing to happen in Rome City Schools in the next four years will include my top priority to help guide the academic success of all students. We must never forget that learning is a continuous process!""

FISHER: ""The most important thing to happen to Rome City Schools cannot be one thing. It is all of the details that work together that make our schools exceptional. We must anticipate classroom demands and plan accordingly. We must integrate technology into curriculum and remain current so our students are competitive for secondary education or work after graduation. We must provide our teachers and students with the tools they need to accomplish curriculum demands. We must provide a comfortable environment for all, even those in the gymnasium. We must partner with our community members because they serve city school students. We must feed our students nutritious and tasteful meals and snacks, because a hungry band student does not have a great practice. We must provide safe transportation. We must maintain our buildings. There are too many factors that work together and when they are out of balance, our whole school system suffers. Academics must always be the first priority, with athletics and arts following its lead, but all three are vital components for our students. We must provide all students with a well-rounded experience from kindergarten to graduation and there is no one thing that will accomplish that.""

EHRLER: ""The community's continued support for our children's education is by far the most important thing that needs to happen for Rome City Schools over the next four years. As a community, we need to pass the ELOST on November 7th. Our schools simply cannot grow in the way we need them to grow without it.""

SWANN: ""Completion of the new Main Elementary school, the 6th Grade STEAM Academy, and the College and Career Academy will establish opportunities for students to learn about career opportunities from the elementary to the high school level.""

HOWARD: ""The atmosphere of faith, reading scores and comprehension levels will rise with hands-on and creative programs. Parental involvement and mentorship will improve in each school. Preparation for college and careers opportunities will prove that early intervention is essential. An Educational Activity Center with a variety of learning departments can be developed in every school or a center to enhance our children's learning.""

BEEMAN: ""The most important thing to happen to Rome City Schools in the next four years is that we will not be looked upon as second to none. Our graduation rate will soar and reach its highest point. Our new Main Elementary School will allow alumni to become fully vested in our amazing school so we can bridge the gap between the community and our combined elementary schools. Children who attend the New Main Elementary will feel a sense of pride that will impact their growth. Our 6th Grade Academy will be STEAM Certified and looked upon as one of the state-of-the-art schools in Georgia. We will be stronger in academics because we will be able to offer more competitive advanced AP classes. Our AP scores will also continue to soar! We will have a Career and College Academy located on our school campus to allow our children to have a fair opportunity to develop in a pathway of their choice that will give them an incredible advantage before graduation. Therefore, our children will be well prepared for college and the workforce. Our athletic program will grow so big, the participants in each program will have followers on the elementary level.""

O'HARA: ""Knowing the inordinate number of changes that have taken place in the last four years, putting stability back into the system is vital. One must realize, however, that to achieve that much-needed stability, more changes must be made and done so through open and honest discussion within the board itself and, especially, with the community. Transparency in all things within the educational process is the cornerstone of a strong public educational system and this must take place for Rome City Schools over the next four years in order to strengthen the confidence and pride our children, parents and citizens of Rome have in our schools.""

DAVIS: ""The most important thing that will happen within our school system in the next four years is dependent on what you and I do now. What will you and I do to stand with children today and in the future? Have you signed up to be a mentor in the schools? Did you talk with a young person about the importance of education today? Did you model appropriate behavior when working through a challenging situation? Were you concerned about a child who does not have an advocate? Did you read to child today? Did you encourage a student to try out for an athletic team? Did you tell a child you noticed his musical talent? The most important thing that will happen in our school system in the next four years is that you and I will choose to stand with children by being present and by being an advocate. We will encourage them to dream big dreams and be prepared; we will be mentors and act like owners in our school system; we will all give back to our community. We will stand with children!""

ROACH: ""The most important thing will be to keep our important positions of leadership filled at each of the schools and the Central Office, especially the positions of superintendent and high school principal.""

JACKSON: ""The most important thing to happen to the Rome City schools in the next four years will be to see the election of a new RCS Board of Education filled with people of vision and a dedication to excellence in education. This will allow us to look back over the past 48 months as having been the best of times in our schools' history; the best in student achievement; an annual increase in college acceptance rates; to see an annual increase in academic scholarships awarded to our graduates; to see that the past 4 years have witnessed the building and opening of the College and Career Academy; and to see all our students graduate with a degree or career choice that prepares them for life in the decades of the 2020s, 30s, 40s and beyond and which will bring to them the ability to pursue the American Dream for themselves and their posterity.""

ULDRICK: ""I don't believe there's just one thing to point to, actually. I feel we must prepare all students to achieve at their highest level - college, workforce, and life ready; promote fiscal responsibility and transparency; and attract, hire, train and retain the most capable and dedicated educators and administrators. Those key goals and strategies will propel the students, parents, teachers, and administrators of Rome City Schools towards excellence in all areas.""

MCDOWELL: ""The most important thing to happen to Rome City Schools in the next four years is likely to be what happens to Rome City Schools on November 7. With all BOE positions up for election, this city is about to define the leadership of our schools. Our schools define the leadership of our future. Nothing could be more important.""

BYINGTON: ""There's no question in my mind that the development of a College and Career Academy will propel Rome City Schools from being one of the best systems in the state to among the elite. Because of that, I believe the passage of the ELOST is the most pressing need we have. Thank you for the opportunity to share my vision for Rome City Schools. As a Rome graduate, husband of a Rome teacher, father of two Rome students, and a current board member, I'm passionate about the future success of our system."""
91,91,"Another week, another item to add to the ever-lengthening list of unpleasant side-effects of the World Wide Web. The latest addition to the roll of misery is cyberchondria, a psychological disorder which is said to have reached epidemic proportions in Britain.

For those who missed yesterday's story, a cyberchondriac is someone who self-diagnoses an ailment after looking up his symptoms on the internet, with guidance from 'Dr Google'.

Unsurprisingly, this unhealthy practice tends to heighten people's anxiety about their health, leading many to convince themselves that they're sicker than they really are.

Of course, there's nothing at all new about hypochondria, which has been around for as long as the human species. It was certainly going strong in the Victorian era, when Jerome K. Jerome wrote Three Men In A Boat.

Indeed, I make no apology for quoting at length from this rarest of comic achievements -- a novel that's almost as funny in 2017 as it was on the day it was published in 1889.

This is the bit, near the beginning, where the narrator describes how his worries about his health persuaded him to embark on a restorative boat trip up the Thames with his friends, George and Harris, and the dog Montmorency.

Call me an overgrown schoolboy, but the moment I saw what the Echo could do, I just had to have one

He recalls how he went to the British Museum one day to read up the treatment for 'some slight ailment of which I had a touch -- hay fever I fancy it was'. When he'd learned all he needed to know about it, he began idly turning the pages to study diseases generally.

'I forget which was the first distemper I plunged into -- some fearful, devastating scourge, I know -- and, before I had glanced half down the list of ""premonitory symptoms"", it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.

'I sat for a while, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of despair, I again turned over the pages. I came to typhoid fever -- read the symptoms -- discovered that I had typhoid fever, must have had it for months without knowing it; wondered what else I had got; turned up St Vitus's Dance -- found, as I expected, that I had that too ... '

By now seriously worried, Jerome says he started going through the medical dictionary alphabetically.

'Read up ague, and learnt that I was sickening for it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight. Bright's disease, I was relieved to find, I had only in a modified form and, so far as that was concerned, I might live for years.

'Cholera I had, with severe complications; and diphtheria I seemed to have been born with. I plodded conscientiously through the 26 letters, and the only malady I could conclude I had not got was housemaid's knee.'

So, yes, hypochondria has been a recognised condition for centuries. The difference is that today we don't have to slog to the reading room of the British Museum to find out what our symptoms may mean.

This is because 90 per cent of British households now have access to the internet, putting us within a mouse-click of billions of words about every real or imaginary ailment known to man, including scores that hadn't been identified (or invented) in Jerome's time.

It's not just our privacy we surrender to the giants of cyberspace when we take delivery of their amazing devices, telling them everything from our taste in music to our diary appointments. It's our sanity, too. Pictured is the Amazon Echo Dot

No wonder, then, that so many more people than ever before have fallen victim to this age-old condition.

There they sit by their computers, frozen with horror and listless with despair, as they convince themselves that their mild hangover is a harbinger of brain cancer, or that the graze on their knee signals the onset of the flesh-devouring infection, necrotising fasciitis.

But we shouldn't laugh. To the sufferer, an imaginary disorder can be as upsetting as the real thing. Indeed, so serious is this outbreak of internet-intensified 'health anxiety', finds a study by King's and Imperial College, London, that as many as one-in-five outpatients in hospitals across the country may be victims.

The cost to the NHS, reckons health economist Dr Barbara Barrett of King's, is at least £420 million a year.

So it is that cyberchondria takes its place alongside countless other unintended consequences of Sir Tim Berners-Lee's brilliant invention of the World Wide Web.

These range from the blood-drenched Arab Spring and the spread of Islamist terrorism to the destruction of the High Street and local newspapers, the proliferation of fake news, hard-core pornography, sexting, paedophile grooming, cyberbullying, cyberfraud (which surely poses as potent a threat to Western civilisation as Kim Jong-Un), industrial-scale invasion of privacy ... Oh, and the growth of an entire generation unable to spell, read maps or conduct a two-minute conversation with a flesh-and-blood human being without breaking off to check the updates on antisocial media.

Yet I blush to confess that even I -- card-carrying technophobe though I am, and deeply conscious of the dangers lurking in cyberspace -- cannot resist the magical allure of the latest electronic devices.

Take last weekend, when our 23-year-old niece and her boyfriend asked us to dinner to show off their love nest. Among their new possessions was an Amazon Echo -- one of those voice-controlled speakers, wirelessly connected to the internet. You just utter the word 'Alexa' and it springs to life, ready to obey any command or answer any question you may fire at it.

As my niece put it through its paces, I was mesmerised: 'Alexa, set the timer for eight minutes'; 'Alexa, play My Very Good Friend The Milkman by Fats Waller'; 'Alexa, how old is Jeremy Corbyn?' etc etc.

Call me an overgrown schoolboy, but the moment I saw what the Echo could do, I just had to have one.

Mine was delivered on Sunday, and I've been playing with it all week: 'Alexa, what are my appointments today?'; 'Alexa, add shaving gel to my shopping list'; 'Alexa, how tall is Tom Cruise?'; 'Alexa, tell me a joke'; 'Alexa, what is tomorrow's weather forecast for Moscow?'

It's become so bad that as I went to bed the other night, I heard myself uttering the words: 'Alexa, goodnight'

Our 26-year-old became so exasperated by his puerile father that he thought he'd teach me a lesson in how stupid the Echo really is. 'Alexa,' he said, 'explain Einstein's theory of relativity.' And it did. In its seductive female voice, it started with the equation E=mc², and went on to describe exactly what it meant.

This was too much for our boy. 'Alexa, all right, that's enough,' he said. 'Nobody loves a smart-arse.'

I noticed that, like me, he was now speaking to this cylinder of plastic, metal and silicon chips as if it (I almost wrote 'she') were a sentient woman.

It's become so bad that as I went to bed the other night, I heard myself uttering the words: 'Alexa, goodnight.'

Then a chill of sheer horror ran down my spine when it/she replied coquettishly: 'Goodnight, sleep tight!'

It's not just our privacy we surrender to the giants of cyberspace when we take delivery of their amazing devices, telling them everything from our taste in music to our diary appointments. It's our sanity, too.

And now I've had an email from Amazon, inviting me to browse through scores of new skills for Alexa, which I can 'enable' with a tap on my iPhone's touch-screen. Worryingly, I see these include apps with names such as Smart Symptom Tracker, Virtual Nurse and Diabetes Facts.

How long before the inanimate object on my kitchen shelf drives me to join the queues at A&E, convinced, like Jerome K. Jerome's narrator, that I'm suffering from every life-threatening disorder in the dictionary, from anaphylaxis to zinc deficiency? I'm sorry, Alexa, but less than a week into our relationship, I'm already falling out of love."
92,92,"IBM said on Thursday it will spend $240 million over the next decade to fund a new artificial intelligence research lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The resulting MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab will focus on a handful of key AI areas including the development of new ""deep learning"" algorithms. Deep learning is a subset of AI that aims to bring human-like learning capabilities to computers so they can operate more autonomously.

The Cambridge, Mass.-based lab will be led by Dario Gil, vice president of AI for IBM Research and Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of MIT's engineering school. It will draw upon about 100 researchers from IBM ibm itself and the university.

Some of those researchers may cross over from existing MIT groups like the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), Media Lab, Brain and Cognitive Sciences Lab, and the Institute for Data Systems and Society, Chandrakasan said via email. Asked whether researchers must use IBM technology in their work, he said they can select the most appropriate technology for their needs.

While there have been other instances of company-funded research at MIT -- Toyota for example has sponsored work on autonomous vehicles within CSAIL -- this is the first time that a single company has underwritten an entire laboratory at the university.

93,93,"Sometimes an international offensive begins with a few shots that draw little notice. So it was last year when Melvin Redick of Harrisburg, Pa., a friendly-looking American with a backward baseball cap and a young daughter, posted on Facebook a link to a brand-new website.

""These guys show hidden truth about Hillary Clinton, George Soros and other leaders of the US,"" he wrote on June 8, 2016. ""Visit #DCLeaks website. It's really interesting!""

Redick turned out to be a remarkably elusive character. No Melvin Redick appears in Pennsylvania records, and his photos seem to be borrowed from an unsuspecting Brazilian. But this fictional concoction has earned a small spot in history: The Redick posts that morning were among the first public signs of an unprecedented foreign intervention in U.S. democracy.

The DCLeaks site had gone live a few days earlier, posting the first samples of material, stolen from prominent Americans by Russian hackers, that would reverberate through the presidential election campaign and into Donald Trump's presidency. The site's phony promoters were in the vanguard of a cyberarmy of counterfeit Facebook and Twitter accounts, a legion of Russian-controlled impostors whose operations are still being unraveled.

The Russian information attack on the election did not stop with the hacking and leaking of Democratic e-mails or the fire hose of stories, true, false and in between, that battered Clinton on Russian outlets like RT and Sputnik. Far less splashy, and far more difficult to trace, was Russia's experimentation on Facebook and Twitter, the U.S. companies that essentially invented the tools of social media and, in this case, did not stop them from being turned into engines of deception and propaganda.

An investigation by the New York Times, and new research from the cybersecurity firm FireEye, reveals some of the mechanisms by which suspected Russian operators used Twitter and Facebook to spread anti-Clinton messages and promote the hacked material they had leaked. On Wednesday, Facebook officials disclosed that they had shut down several hundred accounts that they believe were created by a Russian company linked to the Kremlin and used to buy $100,000 in ads pushing divisive issues during and after the U.S. election campaign.

On Twitter, as on Facebook, Russian fingerprints are on hundreds or thousands of fake accounts that regularly posted anti-Clinton messages. Many were automated Twitter accounts, called bots, that sometimes fired off identical messages seconds apart -- and in the exact alphabetical order of their made-up names, according to the FireEye researchers. On Election Day, for instance, they found that one group of Twitter bots sent out the hashtag #WarAgainstDemocrats more than 1,700 times.

The Russian efforts were sometimes crude or off-key, with a trial-and-error feel, and many of the suspect posts were not widely shared. The fakery may have added only modestly to the din of genuine American voices in the pre-election melee, but it helped fuel a fire of anger and suspicion in a polarized country.

Given the powerful role of social media in political contests, understanding the Russian efforts will be crucial in preventing or blunting similar, or more sophisticated, attacks in the 2018 congressional races and the 2020 presidential election. Multiple government agencies have investigated the Russian attack, though it remains unclear whether any agency is focused specifically on tracking foreign intervention in social media. Both Facebook and Twitter say they are studying the 2016 experience and how to defend against such meddling.

""We know we have to stay vigilant to keep ahead of people who try to misuse our platform,"" Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief security officer, wrote Wednesday in a post about the Russia-linked fake accounts and ads. ""We believe in protecting the integrity of civic discourse.""

Critics say that because shareholders judge the companies partly based on a crucial data point -- ""monthly active users"" -- they are reluctant to police their sites too aggressively for fear of reducing that number. The companies use technical tools and teams of analysts to detect bogus accounts, but the scale of the sites -- 328 million users on Twitter, nearly 2 billion on Facebook -- means they often remove impostors only in response to complaints.

Though both companies have been slow to grapple with the problem of manipulation, they have stepped up efforts to purge fake accounts. Facebook says it takes down 1 million accounts a day -- including some that were related to the recent French election and upcoming German voting -- but struggles to keep up with the illicit activity. Still, the company says the abuse affects only a small fraction of the social network; Facebook officials estimated that of all the ""civic content"" posted on the site in connection with the U.S. election, less than one-tenth of 1 percent resulted from ""information operations"" like the Russian campaign.

Twitter, unlike Facebook, does not require the use of a real name and does not prohibit automated accounts, arguing that it seeks to be a forum for open debate. But it constantly updates a ""trends"" list of most-discussed topics or hashtags, and it says it tries to foil attempts to use bots to create fake trends. However, FireEye found that the suspected Russian bots sometimes managed to do just that, in one case causing the hashtag #HillaryDown to be listed as a trend.

Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent who has closely tracked Russian activity online, said that Facebook and Twitter suffered from a ""bot cancer eroding trust on their platforms."" But he added that while Facebook ""has begun cutting out the tumors by deleting false accounts and fighting fake news,"" Twitter has done little and as a result, ""bots have only spread since the election.""

Asked to comment, Twitter referred to a blog post in June in which it said it was ""doubling down"" on efforts to prevent manipulation but could not reveal details for fear of tipping off those trying to evade the company's measures. But it declared that Twitter's ""open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote"" to falsehoods.

""This is important because we cannot distinguish whether every single Tweet from every person is truthful or not,"" the statement said. ""We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.""

Leaks and counterfeit profiles

Russia has been quite open about playing its hacking card. In February last year, at a conference in Moscow, a top cyberintelligence adviser to President Vladimir Putin hinted that Russia was about to unleash a devastating information attack on the United States.

""We are living in 1948,"" said the adviser, Andrey Krutskikh, referring to the eve of the first Soviet atomic bomb test, in a speech reported by the Washington Post. ""I'm warning you: We are at the verge of having something in the information arena that will allow to us to talk to the Americans as equals.""

Putin's denials of Russian meddling have been coy. In June, he allowed that ""free-spirited"" hackers might have awakened in a good mood one day and spontaneously decided to contribute to ""the fight against those who say bad things about Russia."" Speaking to NBC News, he rejected the idea that evidence pointed to Russia -- while showing a striking familiarity with how cyberattackers might cover their tracks.

""IP addresses can be simply made up,"" Putin said, referring to Internet Protocol addresses, which can identify particular computers. ""There are such IT specialists in the world today, and they can arrange anything and then blame it on whomever. This is no proof.""

Putin had a point. Especially in the social media realm, attributing fake accounts -- to Russia or to any other source -- is always challenging. In January, the CIA, the FBI and the National Security Agency concluded ""with high confidence"" that Putin had ordered an influence operation to damage Clinton's campaign and eventually aid Trump's. In April, Facebook published a public report on information operations using fake accounts. It shied away from naming Russia as the culprit until Wednesday, when the company said it had removed 470 ""inauthentic"" accounts and pages that were ""likely operated out of Russia."" Facebook officials fingered a St. Petersburg company with Kremlin ties called the internet Research Agency.

Russia deliberately blurs its role in influence operations, U.S. intelligence officials say. Even skilled investigators often cannot be sure if a particular Facebook post or Twitter bot came from Russian intelligence employees, paid ""trolls"" in Eastern Europe or hackers from Russia's vast criminal underground. A Russian site called buyaccs.com (""Buy Bulk Accounts at Best Prices"") offers for sale a huge array of pre-existing social media accounts, including on Facebook and Twitter; like wine, the older accounts cost more, because their history makes chicanery harder to spot.

The trail that leads from the Russian operation to the bogus Melvin Redick, however, is fairly clear. U.S. intelligence concluded that DCLeaks.com was created in June 2016 by the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. The site began publishing an eclectic collection of hacked e-mails, notably from George Soros, the financier and Democratic donor, as well as a former NATO commander and some Democratic and Republican staffers. Some of the website's language -- calling Clinton ""President of the Democratic Party"" and referring to her ""electional staff"" -- seemed to belie its pose as a forum run by American activists.

DCLeaks would soon be followed by a blog called Guccifer 2.0, which would leave even more clues of its Russian origin. Those sites' posts, however, would then be dwarfed by those from WikiLeaks, which U.S. officials believe got thousands of Democratic e-mails from Russian intelligence hackers through an intermediary. At each stage, a chorus of dubious Facebook and Twitter accounts -- alongside many legitimate ones -- would applaud the leaks.

During its first weeks online, DCLeaks drew no media attention. But The Times found that some Facebook users somehow discovered the new site quickly and began promoting it on June 8. One was the Redick account, which posted about DCLeaks to the Facebook groups ""World News Headlines"" and ""Breaking News -- World.""

The Redick profile lists Central High School in Philadelphia and Indiana University of Pennsylvania as his alma maters; neither has any record of his attendance. In one of his photos, this purported Pennsylvania lifer is sitting in a restaurant in Brazil -- and in another, his daughter's bedroom appears to have a Brazilian-style electrical outlet. His posts were never personal, just news articles reflecting a pro-Russian worldview.

The same morning, ""Katherine Fulton"" also began promoting DCLeaks in the same awkward English Redick used. ""Hey truth seekers!"" she wrote. ""Who can tell me who are #DCLeaks? Some kind of WikiLeaks? You should visit their website, it contains confidential information about our leaders such as Hillary Clinton, and others http://dcleaks.com/.""

So did ""Alice Donovan,"" who pointed to documents from Soros' Open Society Foundations that she said showed its pro-American tilt and -- in rather formal language for Facebook -- ""describe eventual means and plans of supporting opposition movements, groups or individuals in various countries.""

Might Redick, Fulton, Donovan and others be real Americans who just happened to notice DCLeaks the same day? No. The Times asked Facebook about these and a half-dozen other accounts that appeared to be Russian creations. The company carried out its standard challenge procedure by asking the users to establish their bona fides. All the suspect accounts failed and were removed from Facebook.

Mobilizing a 'bot' army

On Twitter, meanwhile, hundreds of accounts were busy posting anti-Clinton messages and promoting the leaked material obtained by Russian hackers. Investigators for FireEye spent months reviewing Twitter accounts associated with certain online personas, posing as activists, that seemed to show the Russian hand: DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, Anonymous Poland and several others. FireEye concluded that they were associated with one another and with Russian hacking groups, including APT28 or Fancy Bear, which U.S. intelligence blames for the hacking and leaking of Democratic e-mails.

Some accounts, the researchers found, showed clear signs of intermittent human control. But most displayed the rote behavior of automated Twitter bots, which send out tweets according to built-in instructions.

The researchers discovered long lists of bot accounts that sent out identical messages within seconds or minutes of one another, firing in alphabetical order. The researchers coined the term ""warlist"" for them. On Election Day, one such list cited leaks from Anonymous Poland in more than 1,700 tweets. Snippets of them provide a sample of the sequence:

@edanur01 #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:54

@efekinoks #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:54

@elyashayk #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:54

@emrecanbalc #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:55

@emrullahtac #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:55

Lee Foster, who leads the FireEye team examining information operations, said some of the warlist Twitter accounts had previously been used for illicit marketing, suggesting that they may have been purchased on the black market. Some were genuine accounts that had been hijacked. Rachel Usedom, a young American engineer in California, tweeted mostly about her sorority before losing interest in 2014. In November 2016, her account was taken over, renamed #ClintonCurruption, and used to promote the Russian leaks.

Usedom had no idea that her account had been commandeered by anti-Clinton propagandists. ""I was shocked and slightly confused when I found out,"" she said.

Notably, the warlist tweets often included the Twitter handles of users whose attention the senders wanted to catch -- news organizations, journalists, government agencies and politicians, including @realDonaldTrump. By targeting such opinion-shapers, Foster said, the creators of the warlists clearly wanted to stir up conversation about the leaked material.

J.M. Berger, a researcher in Cambridge, Massachusetts, helped build a public web ""dashboard"" for the Washington-based Alliance for Securing Democracy to track hundreds of Twitter accounts that were suspected of links to Russia or that spread Russian propaganda. During the campaign, he said, he often saw the accounts post replies to Trump's tweets.

Trump ""received more direct replies than anyone else,"" Berger said. ""Clearly this was an effort to influence Donald Trump. They know he reads tweets.""

The suspected Russian operators at times lacked sophistication. ""They are not always Americanophiles who know every nuance of U.S. politics,"" said Foster, the FireEye researcher.

For instance, in October, hundreds of Anonymous Poland Twitter accounts posted a forged letter on the stationery of the conservative Bradley Foundation, based in Milwaukee, purporting to show that it had donated $150 million to the Clinton campaign. The foundation denied any such contribution, which would have been illegal and, given its political leaning, highly unlikely.

'A battle of information'

Only a small fraction of all the suspect social media accounts active during the election have been studied by investigators. But there is ample reason to suspect that the Russian meddling may have been far more widespread.

Several activists who ran Facebook pages for Bernie Sanders, for instance, noticed a suspicious flood of hostile comments about Clinton after Sanders had ended his campaign and endorsed her.

John Mattes, who ran the ""San Diego for Bernie Sanders"" page, said he saw a shift from familiar local commenters to newcomers, some with Eastern European names -- including four different accounts using the name ""Oliver Mitov.""

""Those who voted for Bernie, will not vote for corrupt Hillary!"" one of the Mitovs wrote on Oct. 7. ""The Revolution must continue! #NeverHillary""

While he was concerned about being seen as a ""crazy cold warrior,"" Mattes said he came to believe that Russia was the likely source of the anti-Clinton comments. ""The magnitude and viciousness of it -- I would suggest that their fingerprints were on it and no one else had that agenda,"" he said.

Both on the left and the pro-Trump right, though, some skeptics complain that Moscow has become the automatic boogeyman, accused of misdeeds with little proof. Even those who track Russian online activity admit that in the election it was not always easy to sort out who was who.

""Yes, the Russians were involved. Yes, there's a lot of organic support for Trump,"" said Andrew Weisburd, an Illinois online researcher who has written frequently about Russian influence on social media. ""Trying to disaggregate the two was difficult, to put it mildly.""

Weisburd admitted that he had labeled some Twitter accounts ""Kremlin trolls"" based simply on their pro-Russia tweets and with no proof of Russian government ties. The Times contacted several such users, who insisted that they had come by their anti-American, pro-Russian views honestly, without payment or instructions from Moscow.

""Hillary's a warmonger,"" said Marilyn Justice, 66, who lives in Nova Scotia and tweets as @mkj1951. Of Putin, she said in an interview, ""I think he's very patient in the face of provocations.""

Justice said she had first taken an interest in Russia during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, while looking for hockey coverage and finding what she considered a snide anti-Russia bias in the Western media. She said she did get a lot of news from Sputnik and RT but laughed at the notion that she could have Kremlin connections.

Another of the Kremlin trolls, Marcel Sardo, 48, a web producer in Zurich, describes himself bluntly on his Twitter bio as a ""Pro-Russia Media-Sniper."" He said he shared notes daily via Skype and Twitter with online acquaintances, including Justice, on disputes between Russia and the West over who shot down the Malaysian airliner hit by a missile over Ukraine and who used sarin gas in Syria.

""It's a battle of information, and I and my peers have decided to take sides,"" said Sardo, who constantly cites Russian sources and bashed Clinton daily during the campaign. But he denied he had any links to the Russian government.

If that's so, his prolific posts are a victory for Russia's information war -- that admirers of the Kremlin spread what U.S. officials consider to be Russian disinformation on election hacking, Syria, Ukraine and more.

But if Russian officials are gleeful at their success, in last year's election and beyond, they rarely let the mask slip. In an interview with Bloomberg before the election, Putin suggested that reporters were worrying too much about who exactly stole the material.

""Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data?"" he said, in a point that Trump has sometimes echoed. ""The important thing is the content that was given to the public."""

Facebook says it takes down a million accounts a day -- including some that were related to the recent French election and upcoming German voting -- but struggles to keep up with the illicit activity. Still, the company says the abuse affects only a small fraction of the social network; Facebook officials estimated that of all the ""civic content"" posted on the site in connection with the United States election, less than one-tenth of one per cent resulted from ""information operations"" like the Russian campaign.

Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who has closely tracked Russian activity online, said that Facebook and Twitter suffered from a ""bot cancer eroding trust on their platforms."" But he added that while Facebook ""has begun cutting out the tumors by deleting false accounts and fighting fake news,"" Twitter has done little and as a result, ""bots have only spread since the election.""

""This is important because we cannot distinguish whether every single Tweet from every person is truthful or not,"" the statement said. ""We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.""

Leaks and counterfeit profiles

Russia has been quite open about playing its hacking card. In February last year, at a conference in Moscow, a top cyberintelligence adviser to President Vladimir Putin hinted that Russia was about to unleash a devastating information attack on the United States.

""We are living in 1948,"" said the adviser, Andrey Krutskikh, referring to the eve of the first Soviet atomic bomb test, in a speech reported by The Washington Post. ""I'm warning you: We are at the verge of having something in the information arena that will allow to us to talk to the Americans as equals.""

Putin's denials of Russian meddling have been coy. In June, he allowed that ""free-spirited"" hackers might have awakened in a good mood one day and spontaneously decided to contribute to ""the fight against those who say bad things about Russia."" Speaking to NBC News, he rejected the idea that evidence pointed to Russia -- while showing a striking familiarity with how cyberattackers might cover their tracks.

""IP addresses can be simply made up,"" Putin said, referring to Internet protocol addresses, which can identify particular computers. ""There are such IT specialists in the world today, and they can arrange anything and then blame it on whomever. This is no proof.""

Putin had a point. Especially in the social media realm, attributing fake accounts -- to Russia or to any other source -- is always challenging. In January, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded ""with high confidence"" that Putin had ordered an influence operation to damage Clinton's campaign and eventually aid Donald J. Trump's. In April, Facebook published a public report on information operations using fake accounts. It shied away from naming Russia as the culprit until Wednesday, when the company said it had removed 470 ""inauthentic"" accounts and pages that were ""likely operated out of Russia."" Facebook officials fingered a St. Petersburg company with Kremlin ties called the Internet Research Agency.

DCLeaks would soon be followed by a blog called Guccifer 2.0, which would leave even more clues of its Russian origin. Those sites' posts, however, would then be dwarfed by those from WikiLeaks, which American officials believe got thousands of Democratic emails from Russian intelligence hackers through an intermediary. At each stage, a chorus of dubious Facebook and Twitter accounts -- alongside many legitimate ones -- would applaud the leaks.

During its first weeks online, DCLeaks drew no media attention. But The Times found that some Facebook users somehow discovered the new site quickly and began promoting it on June 8. One was the Redick account, which posted about DCLeaks to the Facebook groups ""World News Headlines"" and ""Breaking News -- World.""

The Redick profile lists Central High School in Philadelphia and Indiana University of Pennsylvania as his alma maters; neither has any record of his attendance. In one of his photos, this purported Pennsylvania lifer is sitting in a restaurant in Brazil -- and in another, his daughter's bedroom appears to have a Brazilian-style electrical outlet. His posts were never personal, just news articles reflecting a pro-Russian world view.

The same morning, ""Katherine Fulton"" also began promoting DCLeaks in the same awkward English Redick used. ""Hey truth seekers!"" she wrote. ""Who can tell me who are #DCLeaks? Some kind of Wikileaks? You should visit their website, it contains confidential information about our leaders such as Hillary Clinton, and others http://dcleaks.com/.""

So did ""Alice Donovan,"" who pointed to documents from Soros's Open Society Foundations that she said showed its pro-American tilt and -- in rather formal language for Facebook -- ""describe eventual means and plans of supporting opposition movements, groups or individuals in various countries.""

Might Redick, Fulton, Donovan and others be real Americans who just happened to notice DCLeaks the same day? No. The Times asked Facebook about these and a half-dozen other accounts that appeared to be Russian creations. The company carried out its standard challenge procedure by asking the users to establish their bona fides. All the suspect accounts failed and were removed from Facebook.

On Twitter, meanwhile, hundreds of accounts were busy posting anti-Clinton messages and promoting the leaked material obtained by Russian hackers. Investigators for FireEye spent months reviewing Twitter accounts associated with certain online personas, posing as activists, that seemed to show the Russian hand: DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, Anonymous Poland and several others. FireEye concluded that they were associated with one another and with Russian hacking groups, including APT28 or Fancy Bear, which American intelligence blames for the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails.

Some accounts, the researchers found, showed clear signs of intermittent human control. But most displayed the rote behaviour of automated Twitter bots, which send out tweets according to built-in instructions.

The researchers discovered long lists of bot accounts that sent out identical messages within seconds or minutes of one another, firing in alphabetical order. The researchers coined the term ""warlist"" for them. On Election Day, one such list cited leaks from Anonymous Poland in more than 1,700 tweets. Snippets of them provide a sample of the sequence:

@edanur01 #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:54

@efekinoks #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:54

@elyashayk #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:54

@emrecanbalc #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:55

@emrullahtac #WarAgainstDemocrats 17:55

Lee Foster, who leads the FireEye team examining information operations, said some of the warlist Twitter accounts had previously been used for illicit marketing, suggesting that they may have been purchased on the black market. Some were genuine accounts that had been hijacked. Rachel Usedom, a young American engineer in California, tweeted mostly about her sorority before losing interest in 2014. In November 2016, her account was taken over, renamed #ClintonCurruption, and used to promote the Russian leaks.

Usedom had no idea that her account had been commandeered by anti-Clinton propagandists. ""I was shocked and slightly confused when I found out,"" she said.

Notably, the warlist tweets often included the Twitter handles of users whose attention the senders wanted to catch -- news organizations, journalists, government agencies and politicians, including @realDonaldTrump. By targeting such opinion-shapers, Foster said, the creators of the warlists clearly wanted to stir up conversation about the leaked material.

J. M. Berger, a researcher in Cambridge, Mass., helped build a public web ""dashboard"" for the Washington-based Alliance for Securing Democracy to track hundreds of Twitter accounts that were suspected of links to Russia or that spread Russian propaganda. During the campaign, he said, he often saw the accounts post replies to Trump's tweets.

Trump ""received more direct replies than anyone else,"" Berger said. ""Clearly this was an effort to influence Donald Trump. They know he reads tweets.""

The suspected Russian operators at times lacked sophistication. ""They are not always Americanophiles who know every nuance of U.S. politics,"" said Foster, the FireEye researcher.

For instance, last October, hundreds of Anonymous Poland Twitter accounts posted a forged letter on the stationery of the conservative Bradley Foundation, based in Milwaukee, purporting to show that it had donated $150 million to the Clinton campaign. The foundation denied any such contribution, which would have been illegal and, given its political leaning, highly unlikely.

Only a small fraction of all the suspect social media accounts active during the election have been studied by investigators. But there is ample reason to suspect that the Russian meddling may have been far more widespread.

Several activists who ran Facebook pages for Bernie Sanders, for instance, noticed a suspicious flood of hostile comments about Clinton after Sanders had already ended his campaign and endorsed her.

""Those who voted for Bernie, will not vote for corrupt Hillary!"" one of the Mitovs wrote on Oct. 7. ""The Revolution must continue! #NeverHillary""

While he was concerned about being seen as a ""crazy cold warrior,"" Mattes said he came to believe that Russia was the likely source of the anti-Clinton comments. ""The magnitude and viciousness of it -- I would suggest that their fingerprints were on it and no one else had that agenda,"" he said.

""Yes, the Russians were involved. Yes, there's a lot of organic support for Trump,"" said Andrew Weisburd, an Illinois online researcher who has written frequently about Russian influence on social media. ""Trying to disaggregate the two was difficult, to put it mildly.""

Weisburd admitted that he had labelled some Twitter accounts ""Kremlin trolls"" based simply on their pro-Russia tweets and with no proof of Russian government ties. The Times contacted several such users, who insisted that they had come by their anti-American, pro-Russian views honestly, without payment or instructions from Moscow.

""Hillary's a warmonger,"" said Marilyn Justice, 66, who lives in Nova Scotia and tweets as @mkj1951. Of Putin, she said in an interview, ""I think he's very patient in the face of provocations.""

Justice said she had first taken an interest in Russia during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, while looking for hockey coverage and finding what she considered a snide anti-Russia bias in the Western media. She said she did get a lot of news from Sputnik and RT but laughed at the notion that she could have Kremlin connections.

""It's a battle of information, and I and my peers have decided to take sides,"" said Sardo, who constantly cites Russian sources and bashed Clinton daily during the campaign. But he denied he had any links to the Russian government.

If that's so, his prolific posts are a victory for Russia's information war -- that admirers of the Kremlin spread what American officials consider to be Russian disinformation on election hacking, Syria, Ukraine and more.

""Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data?"" he said, in a point that Trump has sometimes echoed. ""The important thing is the content that was given to the public."""

""These guys show hidden truth about Hillary Clinton, George Soros and other leaders of the US,"" he wrote on June 8, 2016. ""Visit #DCLeaks website. It's really interesting!""

Mr. Redick turned out to be a remarkably elusive character. No Melvin Redick appears in Pennsylvania records, and his photos seem to be borrowed from an unsuspecting Brazilian. But this fictional concoction has earned a small spot in history: The Redick posts that morning were among the first public signs of an unprecedented foreign intervention in American democracy.

The DCLeaks site had gone live a few days earlier, posting the first samples of material, stolen from prominent Americans by Russian hackers, that would reverberate through the presidential election campaign and into the Trump presidency. The site's phony promoters were in the vanguard of a cyberarmy of counterfeit Facebook and Twitter accounts, a legion of Russian-controlled impostors whose operations are still being unraveled.

The Russian information attack on the election did not stop with the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails or the fire hose of stories, true, false and in between, that battered Mrs. Clinton on Russian outlets like RT and Sputnik. Far less splashy, and far more difficult to trace, was Russia's experimentation on Facebook and Twitter, the American companies that essentially invented the tools of social media and, in this case, did not stop them from being turned into engines of deception and propaganda.

An investigation by The New York Times, and new research from the cybersecurity firm FireEye, reveals some of the mechanisms by which suspected Russian operators used Twitter and Facebook to spread anti-Clinton messages and promote the hacked material they had leaked. On Wednesday, Facebook officials disclosed that they had shut down several hundred accounts that they believe were created by a Russian company linked to the Kremlin and used to buy $100,000 in ads pushing divisive issues during and after the American election campaign.

On Twitter, as on Facebook, Russian fingerprints are on hundreds or thousands of fake accounts that regularly posted anti-Clinton messages. Many were automated Twitter accounts, called bots, that sometimes fired off identical messages seconds apart -- and in the exact alphabetical order of their made-up names, according to the FireEye researchers. On Election Day, for instance, they found that one group of Twitter bots sent out the hashtag #WarAgainstDemocrats more than 1,700 times.

The Russian efforts were sometimes crude or off-key, with a trial-and-error feel, and many of the suspect posts were not widely shared. The fakery may have added only modestly to the din of genuine American voices in the pre-election melee, but it helped fuel a fire of anger and suspicion in a polarized country.

Given the powerful role of social media in political contests, understanding the Russian efforts will be crucial in preventing or blunting similar, or more sophisticated, attacks in the 2018 congressional races and the 2020 presidential election. Multiple government agencies have investigated the Russian attack, though it remains unclear whether any agency is focused specifically on tracking foreign intervention in social media. Both Facebook and Twitter say they are studying the 2016 experience and how to defend against such meddling.

""We know we have to stay vigilant to keep ahead of people who try to misuse our platform,"" Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief security officer, wrote on Wednesday in a post about the Russia-linked fake accounts and ads. ""We believe in protecting the integrity of civic discourse.""

Critics say that because shareholders judge the companies partly based on a crucial data point -- ""monthly active users"" -- they are reluctant to police their sites too aggressively for fear of reducing that number. The companies use technical tools and teams of analysts to detect bogus accounts, but the scale of the sites -- 328 million users on Twitter, nearly two billion on Facebook -- means they often remove impostors only in response to complaints.

Though both companies have been slow to grapple with the problem of manipulation, they have stepped up efforts to purge fake accounts. Facebook says it takes down a million accounts a day -- including some that were related to the recent French election and upcoming German voting -- but struggles to keep up with the illicit activity. Still, the company says the abuse affects only a small fraction of the social network; Facebook officials estimated that of all the ""civic content"" posted on the site in connection with the United States election, less than one-tenth of one percent resulted from ""information operations"" like the Russian campaign.

Twitter, unlike Facebook, does not require the use of a real name and does not prohibit automated accounts, arguing that it seeks to be a forum for open debate. But it constantly updates a ""trends"" list of most-discussed topics or hashtags, and it says it tries to foil attempts to use bots to create fake trends. However, FireEye found that the suspected Russian bots sometimes managed to do just that, in one case causing the hashtag #HillaryDown to be listed as a trend.

Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who has closely tracked Russian activity online, said that Facebook and Twitter suffered from a ""bot cancer eroding trust on their platforms."" But he added that while Facebook ""has begun cutting out the tumors by deleting false accounts and fighting fake news,"" Twitter has done little and as a result, ""bots have only spread since the election.""

Asked to comment, Twitter referred to a blog post in June in which it said it was ""doubling down"" on efforts to prevent manipulation but could not reveal details for fear of tipping off those trying to evade the company's measures. But it declared that Twitter's ""open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote"" to falsehoods.

""This is important because we cannot distinguish whether every single Tweet from every person is truthful or not,"" the statement said. ""We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.""

Facebook officials fingered a St. Petersburg company with Kremlin ties called the Internet Research Agency.

Russia deliberately blurs its role in influence operations, American intelligence officials say. Even skilled investigators often cannot be sure if a particular Facebook post or Twitter bot came from Russian intelligence employees, paid ""trolls"" in Eastern Europe or hackers from Russia's vast criminal underground. A Russian site called buyaccs.com (""Buy Bulk Accounts at Best Prices"") offers for sale a huge array of pre-existing social media accounts, including on Facebook and Twitter; like wine, the older accounts cost more, because their history makes chicanery harder to spot.

The trail that leads from the Russian operation to the bogus Melvin Redick, however, is fairly clear. United States intelligence concluded that DCLeaks.com was created in June 2016 by the Russian military intelligence agency G.R.U. The site began publishing an eclectic collection of hacked emails, notably from George Soros, the financier and Democratic donor, as well as a former NATO commander and some Democratic and Republican staffers. Some of the website's language -- calling Mrs. Clinton ""President of the Democratic Party"" and referring to her ""electional staff"" -- seemed to belie its pose as a forum run by American activists.

DCLeaks would soon be followed by a blog called Guccifer 2.0, which would leave even more clues of its Russian origin. Those sites' posts, however, would then be dwarfed by those from WikiLeaks, which American officials believe got thousands of Democratic emails from Russian intelligence hackers through an intermediary.

Mobilizing a 'Bot' Army

'A Battle of Information'

Only a small fraction of all the suspect social media accounts active during the election have been studied by investigators. But there is ample reason to suspect that the Russian meddling may have been far more widespread.

Several activists who ran Facebook pages for Bernie Sanders, for instance, noticed a suspicious flood of hostile comments about Mrs. Clinton after Mr. Sanders had already ended his campaign and endorsed her.

John Mattes, who ran the ""San Diego for Bernie Sanders"" page, said he saw a shift from familiar local commenters to newcomers, some with Eastern European names -- including four different accounts using the name ""Oliver Mitov.""

""Those who voted for Bernie, will not vote for corrupt Hillary!"" one of the Mitovs wrote on Oct. 7. ""The Revolution must continue! #NeverHillary""

While he was concerned about being seen as a ""crazy cold warrior,"" Mr. Mattes said he came to believe that Russia was the likely source of the anti-Clinton comments. ""The magnitude and viciousness of it -- I would suggest that their fingerprints were on it and no one else had that agenda,"" he said.

Both on the left and the pro-Trump right, though, some skeptics complain that Moscow has become the automatic boogeyman, accused of misdeeds with little proof. Even those who track Russian online activity admit that in the election it was not always easy to sort out who was who.

""Yes, the Russians were involved. Yes, there's a lot of organic support for Trump,"" said Andrew Weisburd, an Illinois online researcher who has written frequently about Russian influence on social media. ""Trying to disaggregate the two was difficult, to put it mildly.""

Mr. Weisburd admitted that he had labeled some Twitter accounts ""Kremlin trolls"" based simply on their pro-Russia tweets and with no proof of Russian government ties.

She said she did get a lot of news from Sputnik and RT but laughed at the notion that she could have Kremlin connections.

Another of the so-called Kremlin trolls, Marcel Sardo, 48, a web producer in Zurich, describes himself bluntly on his Twitter bio as a ""Pro-Russia Media-Sniper."" He said he shared notes daily via Skype and Twitter with online acquaintances, including Ms. Justice, on disputes between Russia and the West over who shot down the Malaysian airliner hit by a missile over Ukraine and who used sarin gas in Syria.

""It's a battle of information, and I and my peers have decided to take sides,"" said Mr. Sardo, who constantly cites Russian sources and bashed Mrs. Clinton daily during the campaign. But he denied he had any links to the Russian government.

If that's so, his prolific posts are a victory for Russia's information war -- that admirers of the Kremlin spread what American officials consider to be Russian disinformation on election hacking, Syria, Ukraine and more.

But if Russian officials are gleeful at their success, in last year's election and beyond, they rarely let the mask slip. In an interview with Bloomberg before the election, Mr. Putin suggested that reporters were worrying too much about who exactly stole the material.

""Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data?"" he said, in a point that Mr. Trump has sometimes echoed. ""The important thing is the content that was given to the public."""
96,96,"An Army veteran with a history of filing long-shot lawsuits is suing the state of Alabama for not recognizing his marriage to his computer, according to court records.

Chris Sevier filed a federal lawsuit on August 31 in Alabama's Northern District alleging his rights along with three other plaintiffs were violated by Gov. Kay Ivey, Attorney General Steve Marshall and Blount County Probate Judge Chris Green.

In the past, Sevier, who describes his sexual orientation as 'machinist', has filed several lawsuits in Texas and Utah along with a suit in Colorado seeking to force a baker to make a wedding cake for him and his computer 'bride'.

In the Alabama filing, Sevier claimed that he 'married an object in New Mexico with female like features'. He claims that he asked Green to either recognize the union between him and his Macbook or issue him a new marriage license.

Chris Sevier (above), an Army veteran with a history of filing long-shot lawsuits, is suing the state of Alabama for not recognizing his marriage to his computer, according to court records

Sevier (above) filed a federal lawsuit on August 31 in Alabama's Northern District alleging his rights along with three other plaintiffs were violated by Gov. Kay Ivey, Attorney General Steve Marshall and Blount County Probate Judge Chris Green.

In the Alabama filing, Sevier claimed that he 'married an object in New Mexico with female like features'. He claims that he asked Green to either recognize the union between him and his Macbook (file above) or issue him a new marriage license.

'Defendant Green issues marriage licenses to individuals who self-identify as homosexual, but he refuses to issue marriage licenses to zoophiles, machinists, and polygamists license on a basis that can only be described as procedurally arbitrary,' the complaint states.

The other plaintiffs involved in the suit are John Gunter Jr., Whitney Kohl and Joan Grace Harley.

They are described as polygamists and claim they were denied a license to marry each other, according to the suit.

Green told Alabama.com that the plaintiffs involved in the lawsuit did not request to marry each other in person, but only called to inquire about getting licenses.

'I just said I wouldn't do that in Blount County. No way, no how,' Green said.

Sevier (above) is also a former attorney from Tennessee who was charged previously with stalking and harassing both country star John Rich and a 17-year-old girl

State law does not grant Green the authority to issue polygamist licenses or marriage licenses for people trying to wed an 'inanimate object', he added.

The complaint states Marshall and Ivey allegedly violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights by giving 'special treatment' to gays and lesbians but not 'machinists' or polygamists.

The lawsuit argues that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage across the country was the work of 'moral relativist (sic) who have infiltrated the bench like a cancer (and) cannot be permitted to monkey with the Fourteenth Amendment just because they believe that 'the ends justify the means.''

Sevier is a former attorney from Tennessee who was charged previously with stalking and harassing both country star John Rich and a 17-year-old girl.

Earlier this year, Sevier (above) pushed for pornography taxes in 13 states

Earlier this year, he pushed for pornography taxes in 13 states, according to The Daily Beast.

In 2014, he filed a motion to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeal arguing that if same-sex couples were allowed to wed, he should be able to tie the knot with his laptop.

The amateur model claimed computers were his 'preferred sexual object' and enjoyed sex with the devices more than with 'real women'.

He tried to marry the device, which he said was laden with porn, but the licence was rejected by Utah officials on the grounds of 'sexual orientation'.

His actions bear similarities to Her, a Spike Jonze film in which the protagonist, played by Joaquin Phoenix, falls in love with his operating system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Jonze picked up the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.

Sevier has previously sued Apple claiming the tech giant should have blocked him from accessing porn when he, apparently by accident, typed 'F***book.com instead of Facebook into Google.

Sevier went on in the complaint to allege 'unfair competition' between the porn stars and his wife, brought about by his use of the Apple product, and thus 'interference of the marital contract'."

Given the powerful role of social media in political contests, understanding the Russian efforts will be crucial in preventing or blunting similar, or more sophisticated, attacks in the 2018 congressional races and the 2020 presidential election. Multiple government agencies have investigated the Russian attack, though it remains unclear whether any agency is focused specifically on tracking foreign intervention in social media. Both Facebook and Twitter say they are studying the 2016 experience and how to defend against such meddling.

""We know we have to stay vigilant to keep ahead of people who try to misuse our platform,"" Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief security officer, wrote on Wednesday in a post about the Russia-linked fake accounts and ads. ""We believe in protecting the integrity of civic discourse.""

Critics say that because shareholders judge the companies partly based on a crucial data point -- ""monthly active users"" -- they are reluctant to police their sites too aggressively for fear of reducing that number. The companies use technical tools and teams of analysts to detect bogus accounts, but the scale of the sites -- 328 million users on Twitter, nearly two billion on Facebook -- means they often remove impostors only in response to complaints.

Though both companies have been slow to grapple with the problem of manipulation, they have stepped up efforts to purge fake accounts. Facebook says it takes down a million accounts a day -- including some that were related to the recent French election and upcoming German voting -- but struggles to keep up with the illicit activity. Still, the company says the abuse affects only a small fraction of the social network; Facebook officials estimated that of all the ""civic content"" posted on the site in connection with the United States election, less than one-tenth of one percent resulted from ""information operations"" like the Russian campaign.

Twitter, unlike Facebook, does not require the use of a real name and does not prohibit automated accounts, arguing that it seeks to be a forum for open debate. But it constantly updates a ""trends"" list of most-discussed topics or hashtags, and it says it tries to foil attempts to use bots to create fake trends. However, FireEye found that the suspected Russian bots sometimes managed to do just that, in one case causing the hashtag #HillaryDown to be listed as a trend.

Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who has closely tracked Russian activity online, said that Facebook and Twitter suffered from a ""bot cancer eroding trust on their platforms."" But he added that while Facebook ""has begun cutting out the tumors by deleting false accounts and fighting fake news,"" Twitter has done little and as a result, ""bots have only spread since the election.""

Asked to comment, Twitter referred to a blog post in June in which it said it was ""doubling down"" on efforts to prevent manipulation but could not reveal details for fear of tipping off those trying to evade the company's measures. But it declared that Twitter's ""open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote"" to falsehoods.

""This is important because we cannot distinguish whether every single Tweet from every person is truthful or not,"" the statement said. ""We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.""

Russia has been quite open about playing its hacking card. In February last year, at a conference in Moscow, a top cyberintelligence adviser to President Vladimir V. Putin hinted that Russia was about to unleash a devastating information attack on the United States.

""We are living in 1948,"" said the adviser, Andrey Krutskikh, referring to the eve of the first Soviet atomic bomb test, in a speech reported by The Washington Post. ""I'm warning you: We are at the verge of having something in the information arena that will allow to us to talk to the Americans as equals.""

Mr. Putin's denials of Russian meddling have been coy. In June, he allowed that ""free-spirited"" hackers might have awakened in a good mood one day and spontaneously decided to contribute to ""the fight against those who say bad things about Russia."" Speaking to NBC News, he rejected the idea that evidence pointed to Russia -- while showing a striking familiarity with how cyberattackers might cover their tracks.

""IP addresses can be simply made up,"" Mr. Putin said, referring to Internet protocol addresses, which can identify particular computers. ""There are such IT specialists in the world today, and they can arrange anything and then blame it on whomever. This is no proof.""

Mr. Putin had a point. Especially in the social media realm, attributing fake accounts -- to Russia or to any other source -- is always challenging. In January, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded ""with high confidence"" that Mr. Putin had ordered an influence operation to damage Mrs. Clinton's campaign and eventually aid Donald J. Trump's. In April, Facebook published a public report on information operations using fake accounts. It shied away from naming Russia as the culprit until Wednesday, when the company said it had removed 470 ""inauthentic"" accounts and pages that were ""likely operated out of Russia."" Facebook officials fingered a St. Petersburg company with Kremlin ties called the Internet Research Agency.

Russia deliberately blurs its role in influence operations, American intelligence officials say. Even skilled investigators often cannot be sure if a particular Facebook post or Twitter bot came from Russian intelligence employees, paid ""trolls"" in Eastern Europe or hackers from Russia's vast criminal underground. A Russian site called buyaccs.com (""Buy Bulk Accounts at Best Prices"") offers for sale a huge array of pre-existing social media accounts, including on Facebook and Twitter; like wine, the older accounts cost more, because their history makes chicanery harder to spot.

The trail that leads from the Russian operation to the bogus Melvin Redick, however, is fairly clear. United States intelligence concluded that DCLeaks.com was created in June 2016 by the Russian military intelligence agency G.R.U. The site began publishing an eclectic collection of hacked emails, notably from George Soros, the financier and Democratic donor, as well as a former NATO commander and some Democratic and Republican staffers. Some of the website's language -- calling Mrs. Clinton ""President of the Democratic Party"" and referring to her ""electional staff"" -- seemed to belie its pose as a forum run by American activists.

DCLeaks would soon be followed by a blog called Guccifer 2.0, which would leave even more clues of its Russian origin. Those sites' posts, however, would then be dwarfed by those from WikiLeaks, which American officials believe got thousands of Democratic emails from Russian intelligence hackers through an intermediary. At each stage, a chorus of dubious Facebook and Twitter accounts -- alongside many legitimate ones -- would applaud the leaks.

During its first weeks online, DCLeaks drew no media attention. But The Times found that some Facebook users somehow discovered the new site quickly and began promoting it on June 8. One was the Redick account, which posted about DCLeaks to the Facebook groups ""World News Headlines"" and ""Breaking News -- World.""

The Redick profile lists Central High School in Philadelphia and Indiana University of Pennsylvania as his alma maters; neither has any record of his attendance. In one of his photos, this purported Pennsylvania lifer is sitting in a restaurant in Brazil -- and in another, his daughter's bedroom appears to have a Brazilian-style electrical outlet. His posts were never personal, just news articles reflecting a pro-Russian worldview."

Fadwa Barghouthi reportedly banned from visiting her husband until 2019

Samidoun [Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network] 4 Sept -- Palestinian lawyer Fadwa Barghouthi, the wife of prominent imprisoned Palestinian leader and Fateh central committee member Marwan Barghouthi, said on Monday, 4 September that she had been banned from visiting her husband until 2019 in retaliation for her involvement in supporting the prisoners' hunger strike in April-May 2017. Barghouthi said that she had been denied a visit to see her husband four months ago, turned back at an Israeli occupation checkpoint. Donia al-Watan reported that Barghouthi said she received a one-time visit permit from the International Committee of the Red Cross one week ago, and that she went in a group visit with other families. She remained at the prison from 9 am until 4 pm, only to be told that she was prohibited from seeing her husband. She was told that she was banned from visiting all prisons and would not be allowed to see her husband until 2019, according to news reports....

Palestinian dies weeks after being shot by Israeli forces in al-Duheisha

BETHLEHEM (Ma'an) 3 Sept -- A 22-year-old Palestinian succumbed to critical injuries in an Israeli hospital on Sunday, weeks after he was shot by Israeli forces during a violent detention raid into al-Duheisha refugee camp in the southern occupied West Bank district of Bethlehem. Raed al-Salhi was shot multiple times in the chest at close range, puncturing his liver, during a predawn military raid on Aug. 9. Another resident of the camp Aziz Arafeh was also shot in the leg. The two injured young men were detained by Israeli forces and taken to Israel's Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem. Arafeh has reportedly remained in a stable condition. Head of the Palestinian Committee for Prisoners' Affairs Issa Qaraqe told Ma'an on Sunday afternoon that al-Salhi succumbed to his wounds. Qaraqe said he held Israel responsible for the young man's death, and condemned is Israeli forces for targeting al-Salhi with live ammunition at point blank range. Palestinian prisoners' solidarity network Samidoun reported that during the weeks following his detention, al-Salhi, held in the intensive care unit in a coma, was denied family visits and heavy guarded despite his unconsciousness and severe medical condition. Shortly after the announcement of al-Salhi's death, mourners launched a march in al-Duheisha, chanting condolences to his mother and calling for revenge for the killing. It was later reported that locals in al-Duhiesha refugee camp decided to ban all press from covering al-Salhi's funeral, due to the apparent lack of coverage by local media outlets during the weeks of al-Salhi's hospitalization, according to al-Duheisha al-Hadath, a Facebook page reporting on local events in the camp and across the occupied West Bank.It remained unclear when the funeral would be held or when al-Salhi's body would be handed over by Israeli authorities, who routinely detain the bodies of slain Palestinians for extended periods and impose strict restrictions on their funerals ... During his imprisonment in the hospital, al-Salhi's family members were reportedly denied permits to visit him under the pretext of an ongoing interrogation....[article continues]

Israeli settlers assault, injure Palestinian teen in Nablus

NABLUS (Ma'an) 6 Sept -- A group of Israeli settlers assaulted and wounded a Palestinian teenager near Israel's illegal Homesh settlement in the northern occupied West Bank district of Nablus on Wednesday. Locals told Ma'an that 16-year-old Osama Jamil Daghlas, from the Burqa village, sustained wounds across his body after being assaulted by several settlers at the main road near the Homesh settlement, where locals said the settlers reside. According to locals, the settlers struck the minor with sharp objects and wood, and stripped off his clothes. When the settlers finally released Daghlas, he was taken to Nablus' Rafidiya governmental hospital for treatment...

The UN reported last month that after a three-year decline of settler attacks on Palestinians, the first half of 2017 showed a major increase in such attacks, with 89 incidents being documented so far this year, representing an 88 percent increase compared to 2016. The attacks during this time period have led to the deaths of three Palestinians.

Palestinian youth in critical condition after being struck by Israeli settler's car

BETHLEHEM (Ma'an) 6 Sept -- A Palestinian youth was injured after an Israeli settler hit the youth with his car Tuesday evening near the village of Husan west of Bethlehem, on Route 60, the occupied West Bank's main highway. Israeli police spokeswoman Luba al-Samri said in statement that ""someone from the Jewish community"" hit a Palestinian with his vehicle and fled the scene, but turned himself in at an Israeli police station shortly after. She identified the victim only as a Palestinian ""youth,"" presumably meaning a boy. She described the boy's injury as critical and said he was being treated in a hospital, without providing further details. Incidents involving Israeli settlers hitting Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory are a regular occurrence, and are usually treated by Israeli security forces as accidents, even in cases when witnesses claim the car rammings were deliberate.

An eight-year-old Palestinian girl was killed just over a week ago after she was run over by an Israeli settler in the Nablus district of the northern occupied West Bank.

Every night, settlers harass the Umm al-Kheir villagers

Occupation magazine 1 Sept by Li Lorian -- Demand that the Carmel settlement take responsibility and stop the harassment of Umm al-Kheir! The village of Umm al-Kheir in the south Hebron hills has been under attack by stone-throwers from the adjacent settlement of Carmel for the past five nights. With the sole aim of depriving the villagers of their sleep - every hour throughout the night, a stone is lobbed over the fence. A single stone, jerking an entire village out of sleep. Cowardly, under cover of darkness, the perpetrator runs away. In these summer nights when people sleep outside, the danger of one of the stones physically harming someone is real. Last night Ta'ayush activists spent the night with the people of Umm al-Kheir. When we called the police after the first stone was thrown at about midnight, we were told they would call us back. But this didn't happen. This morning, Friday, September 1, the people of Umm al-Kheir welcomed Eid al-Adha after another sleepless night. The website of the Carmel settlement says: ""Here in Carmel, on the slopes of the southern Judean hills abutting the desert, we live a life of harmony between the rocky mountain and the soft desert, between the pristine mountain air and the caressing desert dryness. Here living side by side are old and young, academics and scientists alongside farmers, Torah scholars alongside hardworking professionals."" What harmony are they talking about?! In Umm al-Kheir children can't get a full night of sleep. In Umm al-Kheir they can't celebrate the holiday in peace. Umm al-Kheir's neighbor, the settlement of Carmel, must be held accountable and stop the stone-thrower/s!

Israel detains elderly Palestinian woman for allegedly intending to carry out attack

BETHLEHEM (Ma'an) 2 Sept -- Israeli forces detained a 60-year-old Palestinian woman near the village of Ni'lin in the central occupied West Bank district of Ramallah on Saturday amid unclear circumstances, as Israeli forces suspected that she was intending to carry out a stabbing attack. According to witness testimonies, Israeli soldiers had opened live ammunition on the woman, injuring her, after suspecting her of intending to carry out a stabbing attack when she walked close to where the soldiers were stationed at an Israeli checkpoint. However, others said that the soldiers had only opened live ammunition in the air, and the woman passed out on the ground before she was detained. The woman has yet to be identified. No one reported seeing a knife on the woman. An Israeli army spokesperson told Ma'an that the incident was not under the army's jurisdiction. An Israeli police spokesperson was not immediately available to comment.

Israeli forces detain 19 Palestinians, target rehabilitation center and print shop

RAMALLAH (Ma'an) 5 Sept -- The Israeli army detained at least 19 Palestinians, including at least one minor, in predawn military raids across the occupied West Bank on Tuesday. Raids in the Ramallah area, which sparked clashes between locals and Israeli forces, targeted a print shop that was sealed off, as well as a center in a refugee camp dedicated to the rehabilitation of disabled people, while leaflets were scattered in the city ordering merchants not to sell toy guns.

In the southern occupied West Bank district of Hebron, the Palestinian Prisoner's Society (PPS) said in a statement that three Palestinians were detained. Jihad al-Masri was detained in the town of Dura, while Yousif Mahmoud Abu Mariya and Hasan Muhammad Zaaqiq were detained in Beit Ummar, the statement said. Local sources clarified that Hamza Jihad al-Masri was detained in al-Surra village near Dura. Local activist in Beit Ummar Muhammad Ayyad Awad told Ma'an that Israeli troops stormed the town's central Bahar neighborhood and ransacked two houses, damaging their interiors, before detaining the two men and taking them both to Israel's Gush Etzion detention center north of Beit Ummar. Awad highlighted that Abu Mariya, 39, has previously served a total of seven years in Israeli custody, and that 22-year-old Zaaqiq was a senior undergraduate at al-Quds University...

In the nearby al-'Arrub refugee camp, Israeli forces also detained 31-year-old Muhammad Mahmoud Hasaniya from his house. Locals said Hasaniya is an officer in the Palestinian Authority's national security forces. The Israeli army spokesperson confirmed one detention in al-'Arrub and said another Palestinian was detained in al-Alaqa village, also in the Hebron district. Ofir Gendelman, a spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister, said on Twitter that a top Palestinian security official, who was later identified as Jalal Naji Sweiti, was also detained for allegedly ""inciting to kill Israelis"" and expressing admiration for Adolf Hitler and Adolf Eichmann in Facebook posts.

Locals also reported military raids in Hebron city's al-Mahawir, Abu Rumman, al-Sharif, and Abu Sneina neighborhoods, where no detentions were reported.

According to the PPS statement, Israeli forces raided al-'Amari refugee camp in the central occupied West Bank district of Ramallah and detained 17-year-old Yahya Jibril Rummana. Local sources said Israeli forces also raided the offices of a local committee for the rehabilitation of disabled people in al-Amari refugee camp, and that the Israeli soldiers damaged equipment there.

Meanwhile, Israeli forces also scattered leaflets throughout the streets of Ramallah and al-Bireh, warning shop owners and merchants not to sell toy guns. The leaflets said that anyone who trades toy guns could be detained because toy guns serve ""a dual purpose,"" locals said. Separately, Israeli forces raided and shut down al-Nur printing house in Ramallah city and confiscated equipment, including computers and printers. The Israeli army alleged that the printing workshop ""produced inciting materials,"" and confirmed that equipment was seized from the business.... https://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=778977

Israeli forces detain 14 Palestinians, seize cash, and assault family in raids

BETHLEHEM (Ma'an) 6 Sept -- Israeli forces detained at least 14 Palestinians during raids in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem before dawn on Wednesday, with one family reporting being violently assaulted by Israeli soldiers during a raid to detain a young man who was not in the house, according to Palestinian sources.

Local sources in the southern occupied West Bank district of Hebron said that Israeli forces detained three Palestinian residents of the area, also seizing cash and a private vehicle during the raids. Munjid Mousa al-Jenidi and Muhammad Maher Ebied were detained after Israeli forces raided their houses in Hebron city, according to the Palestinian Prisoner's Society (PPS) and local sources. Israeli forces detained Muhammad Mousa Rujoub, a Palestinian security forces officer from the Hebron-area town of Dura, after he passed through the Allenby Bridge border crossing with Jordan, upon returning from the hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, PPS and local sources said. Israeli forces raided and searched the homes of Nihyad al-Jabaa and Amro Ebied in Hebron city, but did not detain them, according to locals. A bakery in Hebron was also raided and searched, but its two Palestinian owners were reportedly not detained, according to locals. Sources added that Israeli forces seized 13,000 shekels (about $3,650) and a vehicle from Saadi al-Qawasmeh after raiding his house in Hebron city, though he was not detained. Meanwhile, sources in Beit Ummar north of Hebron city said Israeli forces conducted a violent raid in the town, assaulting a family, but reported no detentions.

Local activist Muhammad Ayyad Awad said that Israeli soldiers raided Muhammad Kamil al-Zaaqiq's house, destroying doors, beds, and other furniture and belongings. Israeli soldiers assaulted Muhammad's two sons Ayman, 37, and Kamil, 20, by kicking them and beating them with rifles. Israeli forces also attempted to assault their 60-year-old Muhammad and his wife, Awad said. According to Awad, Kamil sustained different injuries and was badly bruised...

Palestinian Wafa news agency also reported that Israeli forces shut down a metal workshop in the town of Arraba in the northernmost Jenin district. Palestinian security sources told Wafa that Israeli forces shut down the metal workshop, owned by Mustafa Sadeq Arda, and confiscated equipment from three other metal workshops in the town. Israeli forces regularly target West Bank metals workshops on allegations that weapons are produced there. Israeli news site Arutz Sheva said reported that the workshop was manufacturing firearms and other weapons ""intended for use in terror attacks against Israeli civilians and security personnel."" The newspaper also said that during a raid in the Jenin-area village of al-Mughayyir, Israeli forces found ""a makeshift firearm.""....

Detained Palestinian activist begins hunger strike

RAMALLAH (AP) 5 Sept by Mohammed Daraghmeh -- A prominent Palestinian activist began a hunger strike Tuesday to protest his detention by the Palestinian authorities after he criticized the autonomy government of President Mahmoud Abbas. Issa Amro was detained Monday by Palestinian security forces in Hebron, the West Bank's largest city, after he criticized the detention of a local journalist who had called for Abbas' resignation. Amro expressed his views in a Facebook post. Leading human rights groups blasted Amro's detention. London-based Amnesty International and the Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights said it signals a growing crackdown on free expression in the autonomous Palestinian enclaves in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Amro is the founder of the group Youth Against Settlements in volatile Hebron, where Jewish settlers live in heavily guarded enclaves in the center of the city. Amro was on hunger strike to protest what he said was an unlawful detention, made without a warrant or due process, said his brother, Ahmad Amro. ""Issa started a hunger strike today protesting his arbitrary arrest,"" he said. ""He has been in detention for more than 24 hours without being presented before a prosecutor and without official charges."" Amro's lawyer, Farid al-Atrash, said he visited Amro and the detained local journalist on Monday. ""It is shameful for the Palestinian Authority to arrest such a strong activist against settlement activities and (Israeli) aggressions in Hebron,"" the lawyer said. Amro, 35, also faces charges in an Israeli military court, including allegedly calling for illegal protests and obstructing the official duties of soldiers. Amro has said Israel is trying to silence him and Amnesty has called for the ""baseless"" charges to be dropped. His trial is to resume in October. Al-Atrash said that Israel is trying to halt what he called Amro's ""relentless struggle against settlement activities in Hebron.""....

Israeli court reinstates former prison sentence for Palestinian-French NGO worker

BETHLEHEM (Ma'an) 5 Sept -- A Jerusalem court replaced a six-month administrative detention order -- imprisonment without charge or trial -- issued against human rights defender Salah Hamouri, and replaced it with a reinstatement of a past sentence against him in 2005. The court reinstated the rest of the prison sentence against Hamouri, who is a field researcher for Palestinian prisoners' rights group Addameer, and rescinded the administrative order that was issued against him last week, according to a statement released by Addameer. Hamouri, 32, who holds dual Palestinian-French citizenship, was released three months early from his nearly seven-year sentence in Israeli prison during the Wafa al-Ahrar, or Gilad Shalit prisoners exchange deal in 2011. According to Addameer, the judge has ordered Hamouri to serve the rest of this sentence. The Israeli prosecution and Israeli intelligence have decided to appeal the decision, Addameer said. Hamouri was detained during an overnight raid last month from his home in the occupied East Jerusalem neighborhood of Kafr Aqab.

The East Jerusalem resident was banned from entering the occupied West Bank until Sept. 2016, and his wife Elsa Lefort is currently banned by Israeli authorities from entering the occupied Palestinian territory or Israel. In an unusually high-profile case illustrating the difficulties Palestinians face to obtain -- and keep -- their East Jerusalem residency, Lefort was detained and deported by Israeli authorities in 2016 when she was six-and-a-half months pregnant....

Egyptian power lines to southern Gaza resume operation

GAZA (Ma'an) 6 Sept -- One of the Egyptian power lines feeding the Gaza Strip resumed operation on Tuesday after being cut off for about two months, Gaza's electricity company said. Muhammad Thabet, head of public relations at the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company, said that the 'Gaza 2' electricity line that powers districts in southern Gaza with 10 megawatts was back in operation and providing electricity. Egyptian authorities fixed 'Gaza 1' last week, after it had fallen into disrepair for some 50 days, he added. Now that both power lines have resumed operating, Thabet said he expected the electricity distribution in the besieged coastal enclave to improve. The electricity company official reiterated that most Palestinians in Gaza are being supplied with only four hours of electricity a day. Over the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha that ended on Monday, for a few days, Gaza reportedly received between six to eight hours of electricity a day because ministries and public institutions were on holiday.

Israeli forces allegedly detain Gaza university lecturer over suspicions of hacking

GAZA CITY (Ma'an) 5 Sept -- Israeli forces allegedly detained a Palestinian lecturer from the besieged Gaza Strip last week over suspicions that he was working with a Hamas-affiliated hacker group, sources told Ma'an on Tuesday. Palestinian sources told Ma'an that Israeli forces had detained Dr. Ramzi Abid when he attempted to leave Gaza through the Israeli-controlled Erez crossing last Sunday. The sources said that Abid had been traveling to Italy in order to attend a workshop. Abid works as a lecturer at Gaza's Islamic University, according to the sources. The sources added that Abid was being accused of working with a Hamas-affiliated hacker group, which reportedly targets cell phones and cameras belonging to the Israeli army.

Letter from Gaza: 'Alive due to lack of death'

Al Jazeera 2 Sept by Jehad Abusalim -- In Gaza, entire families sit in the darkness of their living rooms, with candles generating the only light. Dozens of families have lost loved ones in house fires. Propane is scarce, and small generators are unsafe and hard to come by. They are usually smuggled through tunnels and poorly made. One of my college professors lost three children (a 14-year-old and eight-year-old twins) after their generator exploded. Gaza residents face so much hardship and pain, just to secure one of life's basic necessities. When the electricity goes out, the silence is deafening. Everything grinds to a halt: refrigerators, televisions, hospital equipment, water pumps and fans. Modern life stops. The quiet allows us to imagine what the world was like before we were immersed in the noise of car horns and the hum and buzz of modern machines. Later, the quiet is replaced by a storm of sound as generators whir and screech back to life. I will never forget the afternoon when I asked my father how long he thought the blockade would last. ""A few months, my son. A few months. It won't take long,"" he answered. A few weeks ago, more than a decade since the Israeli blockade of Gaza was implemented, I spoke with my father again and reminded him of what he said that day. I could practically feel his sorrow and grief through the phone. ""I don't know how many 10 years there are in one's life,"" he answered, crushed by the naivete of his statement all those years ago. How is it acceptable that in 2017, Gaza's residents, including my own family, have to spend so much of their time worrying about water, light and food? What justifies a policy that causes toddlers like my younger brother to soak in sweat during the night and place their cheeks on the cool tile floor to escape the heat of Gaza's nights?....

Using 3D printers to tackle Gaza's medical shortages

GAZA CITY (Al Jazeera) 5 Sept by Mersiha Gadzo -- The stethoscope, a staple device in modern medicine, is a luxury item in Gaza. At Gaza's largest hospital, al-Shifa, there are only one or two stethoscopes in each department; doctors left without one resort to pressing their ears against patients' chests to diagnose an illness. ""That would be the best-case scenario,"" Canadian doctor Tarek Loubani told Al Jazeera. ""If someone's full of blood, most doctors aren't going to put their ears to the chest. So, doctors are making decisions without that piece of information."" Loubani and three of his peers are working to change that. As part of the Glia team, their goal is to mass-manufacture low-cost, high-quality medical devices for Gaza using 3D printing. They recently received their first batch of stethoscopes. In their office in the centre of Gaza City, a small square piece of the 3D printer moves back and forth across the plate, refining two long pieces. In about two hours, it will finish printing all the pieces to form the tested and approved 3D printed stethoscope - the first of its kind in the Gaza Strip. ""It looks like a toy, but the quality is just as good as the leading brands,"" Mohammed Abu Matar, 31, told Al Jazeera, as he held up one of their finished stethoscopes. The item costs only $3, compared with the industry-leading Littmann Cardiology III, which sells for around $200. It is a huge feat for the Gaza Strip, which suffers from a shortage of much-needed medical equipment. Under the decade-long Israeli-Egyptian blockade, a wide range of medical items are banned from entering Gaza without special coordination due to Israel's ""dual-use"" concerns - namely, that the items could also be used for military purposes. Affordability is another obstacle. A $300 stethoscope is roughly equivalent to a doctor's monthly salary in Gaza....

VIDEO: ICRC calls on Palestinian Authority to end Gaza sanctions

5 Sept -- The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Peter Maurer, is calling on the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs the occupied West Bank, to end its pressure tactics on Gaza, a Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory. Maurer was visiting Gaza before meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. He said the PA's squeeze on salaries and electricity was taking an ""unacceptable toll"" on civilians in the territory, which also suffers from an Israeli blockade. Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett reports from Gaza.

Save the Children warns of unlivable conditions in Gaza

Al Jazeera 4 Sept -- Save the Children says kids are 'unable to sleep, study or play' as enclave faces electricity and environmental crises -- One million children are suffering from ""unlivable"" conditions in the Gaza Strip, according to Save the Children, an international charity that promotes children's rights and provides aid worldwide. ""One million children in Gaza are living in dire conditions,"" the group said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Save the Children considers Gaza to be unlivable now."" ... The continuing electricity crisis and ""environmental crisis"" has left the more than one million children in Gaza unable ""to sleep, study or play"", Save the Children said. According to the charity, more than 740 schools are struggling to function without electricity, and most families receive only two to four hours of electricity each day.

Three years after the war: Gaza youths speak out

MEMO 4 Sept by Ramzy Baroud -- ""At bedtime, I am afraid to turn the lights off. I am not a coward, it is just that I worry that this bulb hanging from the ceiling is the last light that remains (shining) in my life."" Soon after he penned these words, Moath Alhaj, a young artist from a Gaza refugee camp, passed away in his sleep. After disappearing for two days, Moath's friends broke down the door of his house and found him huddled with his blanket in a place in which he lived alone for 11 years. Moath lived in the Nuseirat Refugee Camp, one of Gaza's most crowded camps, a name which is associated with historic hardship, war, and legendary resistance. Raised in the United Arab Emirates, Moath returned to Gaza to join the Islamic University, but remained there, experiencing three wars and a decade-long blockade. Somehow, the young man maintained a semblance of hope as expressed in his many drawings and emotive commentary. Moath learned to live in his own world ever since he was young. The outside world to him seemed unpredictable and, at times, cruel. When his mother passed away, Moath was only 1 year old. His father died of cancer in the UAE and, due to circumstances beyond his control, Moath lived alone. Keeping him company were his friends in the neighborhood, but mostly it was his self-effacing, yet profound artistic expressions. ""Smile, may the war feel shame,"" was one of his cartoons. In it, a little girl with a flowery dress turns her back at the reader, looking the other way. Moath's art characters always had their eyes closed, as if they refuse to see the world around them, and insist on imagining a better world inside their own thoughts. After his body was thoroughly examined, doctors concluded that Moath died as a result of a stroke. His heart, heavy with untold personal and collective miseries, had just given in. And just like that, one of Gaza's finest young men was buried in an ever-crowded graveyard. Social media buzzed with statements of condolences, made mostly by young Palestinians from Gaza, devastated to hear that Moath had died, that his last light had been extinguished, and that the young man's life had ended while the siege and state of war remain....

Internal rift exacerbates academic challenges in Gaza

Gaza (Asharq al-Awsat) 3 Sept - The number of students attending the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip schools declined as the new academic year started due to difficult economic conditions suffered by their guardians. The problems of the education system in the Gaza Strip have been exacerbated by the continued division between Fatah and Hamas, and by the Israeli siege on the coastal strip. As the internal rift widened, hundreds of teachers consequently refused to work due to fear of having their wages cut as the Palestinian Authority took harsh measures against Hamas ministries and institutions in the Gaza Strip. ""The new teachers have been appointed with low salaries, 50 percent less than the original salary, which affects their living conditions and educational contribution,"" media and public relations officer at the Education Ministry in the Gaza Strip Moatasem al-Minawi told Asharq Al-Awsat ... On the academic curricula, Minawi said that there is full coordination between Gaza and the West Bank, revealing as well the construction and furnishing of new schools. There is coordination, but we hope that differences will end so that the work is improves for us all,"" said Minawi.

Gaza family remains rooted 15 years after massacre

[with photos] Electronic Intifada 5 Sept by Mousa Tawfiq & Mohammed Asad -- The al-Hajeen family's sun-soaked and verdant orchard in southern Gaza City, planted in an area near the Mediterranean coast famous for its figs and grapes, is idyllic. But like just about every other patch of land in Gaza it has also been the scene of tragedy. Fifteen years ago, four members of the family were killed by Israeli fire as they rested on their land. The al-Hajeen orchard is less than a mile away from the former location of Netzarim, an Israeli settlement that was evacuated in 2005. ""Every evening, two Israeli tanks would sit on a hill 200 meters from our land, watching us while we harvested,"" Khaled al-Hajeen, who goes by Abu Ismail, told The Electronic Intifada. In early August 2002, on the eve of the annual grape harvest, soldiers in tanks came to the al-Hajeen family's land and there was a short conversation. ""We told them that we would be coming every day with our women and children to harvest our crops. They told us that they watch us and we are safe, as long as no one reaches their hill,"" Abu Ismail said. The family, including women and children, began to spend more time on their land for the harvest. But everything changed on 29 August, just a few days before the start of the new school year. ""My nephews wanted to spend their last night [before school] on our land,"" Abu Ismail explained. ""I came here with my brother, his wife and my nephews."" After dinner, Abu Ismail took his younger nephews to sleep in one tent, while the older ones were in a separate tent along with Abu Ismail's brother. Shortly before midnight Abu Ismail heard a tank shell nearby. ""I stood up and saw the laser of the Israeli tanks on me,"" he said. ""I quickly lay on the ground. I knew that the shell had hit my nephews' tent. I saw my brother's wife running towards her children. She was directly hit and died immediately. They were shooting at everything that was moving. Shells and bullets were everywhere.""...

But the army wasn't done turning the family's lives upside down. ""Two months later, in October 2002, my neighbors called me and said, come and look at your land, the bulldozers were here. I didn't understand and came here quickly,"" Abu Ismail said. The army had razed his orchard, leaving ""nothing but hills of sand,"" he added. ""What did I do? I cried. I cried as I had never done before."" The Gaza municipality helped Abu Ismail and his neighbors, whose lands were also razed, to delineate the boundaries of their properties. Abu Ismail and his relatives began digging deep in the sand to excavate and replant the roots of their oldest trees, the ones planted by his father decades ago. ""We worked for four months, from morning to evening, to find our trees. Luckily we found 80 percent of them. And now, this is our new farm - old roots but new branches....

When getting a college degree requires self-exile

NY Times 6 Sept by Zaina Arafat -- Before Ghada Tafesh left the Gaza Strip for college in the United States, her family gave her a necklace with two pendants. One was in the shape of historic Palestine. The other was an olive tree. ""They wanted me to have something that would remind me of home, and to never be ashamed of where I come from,"" she told me. Ms. Tafesh has much to be proud of as she begins the final year of her master's program in humanities at Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., this fall. But the trade-off was painful: getting her education meant not returning home for six years ... But Ms. Tafesh was often homesick, especially during wars (two have occurred so far in her time abroad) and when, during her sophomore year, she had to undergo open-heart surgery for a congenital heart condition. ""Back home in Gaza, I would probably be dead by now,"" she said....

Gaza rapper hopes to hip-hop to world stardom

GAZA (Reuters) 5 Sept by Nidal al-Mughrabi -- Ibrahim Ghunaim, or MC Gaza as he likes to be called, raps to a different beat in an Islamist-ruled Palestinian enclave rocked by internal conflict and three wars with Israel over the past decade. The 25-year-old, who grew up listening to American rapper Eminem, began rapping when he was 13 and hopes for an international career one day. ""I believe I was born to become a rapper,"" Ghunaim told Reuters. It took years to change the public perception of hip hop in the conservative Gaza Strip, which the Hamas movement seized in 2007 from forces loyal to Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Rappers in Gaza did not have an easy start, and their first performance in 2005 - to celebrate Israel's withdrawal of troops and settlers - did not go down well. At the show, a pioneer rap band had to flee the stage after a crowd was angered by what it viewed as offensive hand gestures by the performers. Ghunaim's songs focus on Gaza's high unemployment, women's rights, young Palestinians jailed by Israel for alleged security offences and the absence of peace. This year alone, he's written 25 songs....

Southern farmers seek to bring back Gaza workers

YERUSHALAYIM (Hamodia) 4 Sept by Dror Halavy -- Despite suffering from them for years, farmers in southern Israel want to have a closer working relationship with Gazans. In a letter to Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, the farmers asked for authorization to allow workers from Gaza to enter Israel to work on their farms. In the letter, the farmers wrote that their request ""is based on mutual interests - both ours and that of Gazans. We wish to restore the situation to what it was in years past,"" when tens of thousands of Gazans worked on Israeli farms. Israel largely banned workers from Gaza after Hamas took over the Gaza Strip 11 years ago, and since then farmers in southern Israel have searched the world for migrant workers willing to do the hard agricultural work Israelis are not interested in. Workers on farms hail from Thailand, China, Philippines and other Asian countries, as well as from Eastern Europe. However, the expenses involved in housing and feeding these workers are high; in their letter, the farmers wrote that ""in most cases, it is economically more advantageous for us to employ workers from Gaza than the current arrangements we have."" In addition, the farmers wrote, providing Gaza farmhands with work will help alleviate the poverty in Gaza. ""We are also interested in helping Gaza families to whatever extent we can. We believe that providing economic assistance and benefits for Gaza residents is in Israel's interests as well,"" the letter said. While Liberman is said to be favorably disposed to the idea - as is the IDF - the Shin Bet is opposed to it, over the likelihood that Hamas will use the program to smuggle terrorists into Israel, making it easier to attack Israeli citizens.

Rally marks three years since disappearance of Ethiopian-Israeli man into Gaza

JERUSALEM (JTA) 4 Sept -- About 100 people attended a rally in support of the family of an Ethiopian-Israeli man held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip to mark three years since his disappearance. The demonstrators joined the family of Avraham Abera Mengistu on Sunday night at Tel Aviv's Habima Square. Mengistu, 30, of Ashkelon, has not been heard from since September 2014, when he is believed to have voluntarily climbed over the security fence between Israel and Gaza. He suffers from mental illness and was exempt from serving in Israel's military. Mengistu's parents met last week in Israel with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres and called for information about their son's fate. In June, the Israeli army turned over to the family a security camera video showing Mengistu crossing over into Gaza. Hamas has admitted that it holds Mengistu, as well as a Bedouin-Israeli man who also is said to be mentally ill who crossed into Gaza, and a third Israeli who entered Gaza voluntarily. Hamas also holds the remains of two Israeli soldiers, Lt. Hadar Goldin and Sgt. Oron Shaul, both killed during Operation Protective Edge in 2014.

Land, property theft & destruction / Ethnic cleansing / Settlements / Apartheid

The writing on the wall: Signs of occupation in Hebron

The Forward 29 Aug by Issa Amro -- ... There are between 600 and 850 settlers, many of them extremists, living in downtown Hebron, with around 1,500 soldiers to protect them. For more than a decade, settlers have been installing these new Hebrew and English signs throughout Hebron as part of an effort to assert their dominance over Palestinians in the city and erase our identities. Over the past two years, the number of signs has rapidly increased. Throughout Shuhada Street are directional signs in Hebrew and English: Chabad Cemetery, Old Jewish Cemetery, Ancient Tel Hebron. In the middle of the street are a series of murals. Above the murals are signs posted by the settlers with political statements declaring that Hebron belongs to them. Their signs are illegal even under Israeli law, which requires, according to the Hebron Protocol signed in 1997, that the Palestinian identity of the city be protected. In addition to changing street names from Arabic to English and Hebrew, many of the signs are mounted on private Palestinian shops and homes without the owner's consent. This is not only erasure, it is incitement. As part of an effort to have the signs removed, Rabbis for Human Rights has partnered with my organization, Youth Against Settlements, in filing suit against them in an Israeli court. Given the illegality of the signs, we had requested the Israeli army secure the area so we could remove them. The army refused to grant our request, citing fear of violence. Now we are taking the case to Israel's high court in Jerusalem. Our petition reads: ""In a systematic, deliberate manner, the Committee of the Renewal of the Jewish Community of Hebron erases Palestinian cultural identity from Hebron's Shuhada Street and replaces it with a narrative consistent with the position of its members ... Let me be clear. I am not opposed to Jews coming to Hebron. It is the violent, hateful and illegal settler presence, protected by a hostile foreign army, that I am opposed to. It is decades of a colonial project that works day and night to erase my Palestinian identity and displace me from my land and birthplace that I am opposed to. Because of the illegal settlers, unemployment in Hebron's old city, the area under Israeli military control, is over 70%. That is even higher than in Gaza. Having control of our religious sites and historic streets and marketplaces, combined with the removal of the Israeli military and their checkpoints and movement barriers, could create a booming tourist industry for our city, for which, without a doubt, Jews would be among our most frequent visitors....

Nabi Saleh: ""It's a silent ethnic cleansing'

RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank (Al Jazeera) 4 Sept by Jaclynn Ashly -- Ahed Tamimi was just 14 when she rose to international prominence through the release of a video and a series of photos capturing her desperate attempts to save her 11-year-old brother, Mohammad, from the grips of an Israeli soldier in 2015. ""Many Israelis threatened me on social media after the video was released, demanding that I be detained or even killed,"" 16-year-old Ahed told Al Jazeera from her family's home in the village of Nabi Saleh, where the distinct, red-tiled roofs of illegal Israeli settlement housing dot the adjacent hilltop. ""The harassment handcuffed my life. I was scared to even go outside or visit my friends."" ... The harassment began immediately following the video's release, as Israelis called her a ""terrorist"" on social media and threatened to kill her, the family says. Bassem, Ahed's father and a long-standing leader in the village, said that her 19-year-old brother, Waed, was detained after the release of the video. At the start of his 10-month stay in Israeli jail, Ahed's mother, Nariman, received permission to enter Israel to visit him, and Ahed tagged along. ""When we passed a checkpoint near Jerusalem, the Israeli soldiers got on the bus and immediately singled her out,"" Nariman told Al Jazeera. ""While everyone else was permitted to pass, Ahed was pulled off the bus and told she wouldn't be allowed into Israel."" During the village's protests, Israeli forces would often scream Ahed's name and shout curses at her. ""Look! It's Ahed Tamimi. Shoot her!"" Bassem recalled one soldier as saying. The family was often scared for their daughter, he added: ""Whenever the soldiers recognise her, they do something to make her life difficult. Every time she left the house, we were scared something would happen to her."" Ahed was even forced to stay at her cousin's home in Ramallah, where she attends school, to avoid the danger of passing through Israeli checkpoints on her way from Nabi Saleh. The Tamimi family is no stranger to Israeli persecution. In 2012, Amnesty International labelled Bassem a prisoner of conscience during one of his numerous stays in Israeli prison. Nariman has been detained five times by Israeli forces, and Waed twice, for their involvement in protests. In 2010, just a few months after the weekly protests began, Israeli authorities issued a demolition order on the family's home, which Bassem believes was intended to pressure them to cease their involvement in the protest movement. Their home has since been raided more than 150 times by Israeli forces, he said. Meanwhile, hundreds of dunams of Nabi Saleh's lands have been confiscated for the purposes of building Israel's illegal Halamish settlement, whose residents have burned hundreds of the village's olive trees - attacks that escalated after the protests began. In 2009, the village's water spring was also confiscated for the use of the settlers. The 600 or so residents of the village receive only 12 hours of running water a week from Israel, while the settlers in Halamish have running water 24 hours a day....

Israel 'illegally' transfers Palestinian land in West Bank to Jewish National Land

Daily Sabah 5 Sept -- Israel's Ministry of Justice transferred nearly a hundred hectares of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank to the Jewish National Fund (JNF), the Palestinian Authority said Monday. Hassan Burejiya, the Bethlehem coordinator of the committee against the separation wall and settlement units, said the Palestinian Authority condemns the move to transfer 80.5 hectares of agricultural land to the JNF, calling it theft and a violation of the law. Last week, Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said the land located in south Bethlehem was transferred. The decision was taken despite a continuing legal battle over the ownership of the land near the Gush Etzion junction. The Jewish National Fund, founded in 1901 to develop land in Palestine for Jewish settlements, is an organization obtaining funds from Jewish families around the world....

B'Tselem to Netanyhau and other top Israeli officials: Demolishing Palestinian communities - a war crime for which you would bear personal liability

B'Tselem press release 5 Sept -- The Defense Minister declared that Israel is preparing to expel two Palestinian communities in the West Bank - an unlawful action that would constitute forcible transfer of protected persons in occupied territory -- Yesterday, 4 September 2017, B'Tselem sent a grave letter to Israel's prime minister, the defense minister, the chief of staff and the head of the Civil Administration, cautioning that demolition of the Palestinian communities of Susiya and Khan al-Ahmar as planned would constitute a war crime for which they would bear personal liability. B'Tselem made the unusual move after Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman told the press last week that the defense ministry was ""preparing for the evacuation of Palestinian communities built without authorization"" and that ""work was being done to implement plans to evacuate the Palestinian villages of Sussia in the South Hebron Hills and Khan al-Ahmar near Ma'aleh Adumim within a few months."" The demolition of entire communities in the Occupied Territories is virtually unprecedented since 1967. In its letter, B'Tselem warned that under the Fourth Geneva Convention, which Israel is obliged to respect in all its actions in the West Bank, forcible transfer of protected persons inside the occupied territory is prohibited and constitutes a war crime. The organization emphasized that the prohibition on forcible transfer of protected persons is not limited to transfer by physical force, but applies also to ""departure due to impossible living conditions created by the authorities - through, for instance, demolishing homes or disconnecting them from electricity and running water. ""....

Ministers earmark $15 million to resume construction of new settlement

Times of Israel 3 Sept by Jacob Magid -- After a month-long building freeze due to budgetary disputes, the cabinet approved a plan on Sunday that will allow for construction to resume on a new settlement for evacuees of the illegal Amona outpost. The Finance Ministry will transfer NIS 55 million ($15.3 million) to the Interior Ministry for the purpose of infrastructure work in Amichai, adjacent to Shiloh in the northern West Bank ... An additional NIS 5 million ($1.4 million) will go to the Defense Ministry to fund the installation of mobile homes on a hilltop adjacent to Shiloh until the construction of permanent homes is completed ... The Peace Now settlement watchdog panned the cabinet's decision. ""There is no limit to the groveling of the Israeli government,"" the NGO said in a statement Sunday. The group added that ""42 families, which the court ruled had stolen private land, are extorting the government,"" while funding for educational programs and pensions for the disabled is neglected. Amona was evacuated in February after the High Court of Justice ruled that it had been built on private Palestinian land. The 42 families that used to live there have since been residing in dormitory-style housing in the nearby Ofra settlement, waiting for the completion of Amichai.

Israel to destroy sole water source of Nablus area village

IMEMC 6 Sept -- Israeli forces, Tuesday, notified Palestinians of their intentions to destroy the water pipeline providing services to residents in a locale near the village of Douma, south of Nablus, said a local official. Ghassan Daghles, monitoring Israeli settlement activity in the north of the West Bank, said that forces handed residents notices informing them of their intention to remove the pipeline; the sole source of water for that area. There are only 14 families living in the locale, according to WAFA.

Occupation authorities cut off water supply to West Bank village

BETHLEHEM (PNN) 6 Sept -- Palestinians living in Ain al-Baida village, Tubas, West Bank, staged a demonstration on Wednesday against the occupation's decision to cut water supply to the village. A member of the village council Fares Fakha told PNN that the occupation's policy started by gradually reducing the amount of water that reaches the villagers, who are almost 1700 villagers and most of them work in agriculture. He added that water supply went from 240 to 180 until it reached 30 cups per hour, causing damage to the agriculture especially with the high temperature. Another member of the village council said that the occupation cut off the water this morning at 8 o'clock completely. He added that the occupation follows this systematic policy against the people of the village in particular, and the people of the Jordan Valley in general to displace them from their land.

After decades of darkness, Palestinian village gets power

Haaretz 4 Sept by Yotam Berger -- Following a High Court petition, Israel takes steps to provide the West Bank village with electricity -- Asma Rashid Hatib, 76, used to get out of bed and crawl to the bathroom every night. In Dhaher al-Malah, a village in the northwestern West Bank where she lives, there was never an orderly link-up to the electricity. There was no light on the street at night, and Hatib was afraid of falling. ""I did actually fall many times,"" she told Haaretz. The lives of Hatib and the other 240 residents of the villages changed dramatically early last month, when Israel's Civil Administration finally turned on the switch and the little village was linked up to the electricity network for the first time in its history. ""Life before electricity was different. It was dark. Now everything has changed,"" said Hatib. Dhahar al-Malah is one of the few Palestinian villages whose residents have lived in Area C for around ninety years. It is now under Israeli military and civil control -- and is located on the western side of the separation fence, near the Israeli community of Katzir. Those who live and work in the Palestinian Authority have to cross a checkpoint every morning to the Palestinian side of the fence. The village was built in the 1930s and has never had electricity. In 1967 it had about 10 buildings and now it has several dozen. A few are defined as illegal, but most fell between the cracks, and Israel did not grant them official recognition until now....

Israel delays evacuation of settlers from Palestinian-owned home in Hebron

BETHLEHEM (Ma'an) 4 Sept -- After the state of Israel ordered a group of Israeli settlers to evacuate a Palestinian-owned building in the southern occupied West Bank city of Hebron, the Israeli Supreme Court has ordered to delay the evacuation based on an appeal submitted by the settlers. According to Israeli media reports, the settlers' appeal is based on the same erroneous ownership claims to the property -- owned by the Abu Rajab family and referred to as Beit HaMachpela by the settlers -- that have already been debunked in previous legal proceedings. The 15 settler families forcibly took over parts of the three-story Abu Rajab house in July. Last Sunday on Aug. 27, the Israeli state prosecutor gave them a week to leave peacefully in response to the petitions submitted by the Palestinian owners to the Israeli Supreme Court. A week later on Sep. 3, the settlers submitted their own petition to the court, which then issued a temporary injunction to prevent the evacuation until the deadline for the state's response to that appeal, due on Sep. 10, according to Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now....

Palestinian family evicted from Jerusalem home of 50 years

Al Jazeera 6 Sept -- Israeli police have evicted a Palestinian family from their home of more than 50 years in occupied East Jerusalem, a move denounced by rights groups as part of a wider attempt by pro-settlement groups to ""Israelise Palestinian neighbourhoods"". The members of the Shamasneh family were evacuated early on Tuesday morning after fighting several court battles to keep the house - but Israel's Supreme Court decided that Israeli claimants were the legal occupants. Municipality officials backed by armed police officers enforced the court order to remove the family from the home, which was claimed by heirs of a Jewish family forced to abandon it in 1948 when it came under Jordanian control. Israel took control of the area after the 1967 war and continued existing rental arrangements with Palestinian tenants, but a law allowing Jews to reclaim former homes or repurchase them have created conflicts. Under Israeli law, Jews who fled East Jerusalem can reclaim their property, however, Palestinians who fled property in 1948 are not afforded similar rights. Armed officers were seen escorting the Shamasnehs out of the home in Sheikh Jarah neighbourhood, with the elderly Ayoub Shamasneh, 79, carried out by his relatives. ""Our case is a humanitarian case, deeper than a political case,"" Mohammed Shamasneh told Al Jazeera ahead of the eviction. ""The humanitarian aspect is that families have been living here peacefully for decades, with love and kindness."" This is the first evacuation of a Palestinian family in Jerusalem since 2009....

PHOTOS: Settlers move into East Jerusalem home after Israel evicts Palestinian family

BETHLEHEM (Ma'an) 5 Sept -- A Palestinian family was evicted from their home of 53 years in the occupied East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah early Tuesday morning, culminating a protracted legal battle by which Israeli authorities claim the property belongs to Israeli settlers ... Members of the Shamasna family told Ma'an that large numbers of Israeli police officers, special units, and intelligence officers stormed the house and forcibly evacuated the family before they started to move their furniture and belongings into a truck. The family highlighted that Israeli forces closed all streets and entrances to the area and prevented reporters and neighbors from accessing the building. Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now reported later Tuesday morning that the settlers were already inside the house, while the Shamasna family looked on from outside. A reporter from Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post said on Twitter that three teenagers had occupied the building.

Jewish heir opposes eviction of Palestinians from East Jerusalem home: 'I feel very bad'

Haaretz 7 Sept by Nir Hasson -- Dalia Hubara says she feels very bad about Tuesday's eviction of the Shamasneh family from their home in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of Jerusalem. Hubara, one of the heirs to the house, told Haaretz she ""does not like to see people removed from their homes, not Jews and not Arabs."" Hubara inherited the building, a rather small house in the neighborhood, named in Hebrew Shimon Hatzadik, from her mother, who lived there until 1948. Over 10 years ago the family, who inherited the property, sold their rights to right-wing activist Aryeh King, today a member of the Jerusalem city council. They had wanted to sell the house to a Palestinian family before that, but the Palestinians could not raise the money needed, said Hubara. ""King and his friends got in touch with us and we thought it would be good to be rid of the property and sell it, she said. ""I considered selling it to the people living there, my husband was in contact with them. We wanted to do it so what happened [Tuesday] would not happen. But they couldn't manage to buy the house,"" said Hubara. When they saw it wasn't working out and King was constantly after them to buy it, they sold it to him in the end. ""But I didn't evict people and I'm not involved. I had completely forgotten about the story,"" she said.

Michael Ben-Yair, a former attorney general, came to the house on Tuesday. He too inherited a family property in Sheikh Jarrah, but says he, like all the other Jewish families who lived in the neighborhood, has already been compensated for the loss of the home. In return they received a home abandoned by Arabs who fled West Jerusalem during the War of Independence, he says. Ben-Yair said he intends on requesting all the ownership documents concerning the house and plans on giving them, for free, to the family that was evicted. ""If it is even possible to speak of 'justice under conditions of war,' then such justice was not done here,"" he wrote on Tuesday on his Facebook page....

Opinion: In Arab East Jerusalem, Zionism's model apartment / Gideon Levy

Haaretz 7 Sept -- There's one like it in every construction project, the model apartment. Anyone who wants to see what the building will look like when it's completed, comes to see the model apartment. The up-to-date Zionist project also has a model apartment - on Kunder Street, not far from Nablus Road, in Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. It's worth visiting. This apartment is where they should bring all the Birthright participants, to show them what the Zionist project, in whose name they are brought here by the tens of thousands, really looks like. Other guests of Israel, those who ask whether there's apartheid here, should also be brought to the house on Kunder Street. This is where their questions will end. This is where the Shamasneh family lived for 53 years, as renters. This is what it's like in Zionism's model apartment. This act of eviction is nothing new, of course. It's as old as the entire Zionist project. Eight family members, including an 84-year-old man in a wheelchair, were evicted from the apartment because before 1948, its owner was Jewish. Now the house has been returned to the owner's heirs, the descendants of the late Haim Ben Sulimani Yan'i ... The house on Kunder Street is the Zionist project's model apartment, because here you get it all in a refined, condensed form. Here Israel says, without stammering: Entrance for Jews only. Exit for Arabs. Not only the right of return, but the right of property is also exclusively for Jews. A Jew who lost his home in 1948 will have his house returned to him with all respect. A Palestinian - and there were hundreds of thousands of them - has lost it forever. Two justice systems on an ethnic basis. In other languages it's called apartheid. There's no other name for it ... Justice can only exist in one format: equality for everyone. But Zionism continues to say ""no"" to this singular justice. To say that in 1948 there were only Jewish refugees is an especially insolent version of Nakba denial. For what is the difference between the heirs of the owners of the land on which my house is built, on the ruins of Sheikh Munis, and Haim Yan'i's heirs? In the model apartment on Kunder Street, all shame has been lost.

Opinion: Why would the army spokesperson lie? / Amira Hass

Haaretz 4 Sept -- Every Jewish Israeli mother should know her son was drafted to ensure that only kosher Jewish sheep enjoy a free life in the Jordan Valley -- Before you know it, the Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson's Office will also be saying that peace activist Rabbi Arik Ascherman attacked Israel Defense Forces officer Osher Ein-Gal. It's just the type of falsehood that has appeared more than once in its responses to questions about Israeli soldiers who attacked Palestinian civilians, and it was all that was missing from the fantastical account it provided me of a recent incident. In brief, I had asked if when Ein-Gal had kicked a row of spikes under the slowing car being driven by Ascherman, he was following the procedure at flying checkpoints. The spokesperson's office basically responded that Ascherman had driven over the spikes of his own free will. With four occupants in his car. These details are of marginal importance here, but they are typical. Anything goes when the IDF is obeying its settler masters and is fulfilling the sacred mission of expelling Palestinian shepherds from their pastureland. On Friday, August 25, at around 6 A.M., the cars of two Israeli activists arrived in the 'Auja area of the West Bank, just north of Jericho. For several months now, the activists have been accompanying Palestinian shepherds from the Bedouin Ka'bana tribe who had been driven off their grazing lands in the Jordan Valley by settler violence for many years. The activists are members of the joint Jewish-Palestinian Ta'ayush movement and are sometimes joined by members of Machsom Watch, Combatants for Peace and non-affiliated activists. By the way, some of the people accompanying the shepherds were attacked last April by ""unknown"" masked Israelis who came from the vicinity of the Kochav Hashahar settlement, armed with clubs and stones. A video clip of the brutal attack has been posted online. Thanks for asking. The attackers are all well and kicking ... The shepherds' decision to return their flocks to the grazing lands has irked the settlers of Mevo'ot Yericho and at the unauthorized, illegal Einot Kedem ranch. Members of the Najadah family from the Ka'bana tribe sum up: ""We are grazing our flock, Omer [Atidia, the owner of Einot Kedem] shows up. We see him making a call on his cellphone and the army immediately arrives.""

Punitive demolitions

An effective deterrent? A closer look at West Bank home demolitions

JPost 1 Sept by Adam Rasgon -- On a hot summer day in August, the Atta family received a phone call from its lawyer. ""Evacuate everything from your home,"" Labib Habib said. The High Court had largely rejected an appeal the family submitted days earlier to prevent the IDF from demolishing its home in the middle of Deir Abu Meshaal, a working-class Palestinian village about 20 minutes driving from Ramallah. The court had ruled that the IDF could demolish the top level of the home, but had to leave the bottom level intact. Two weeks later, IDF vehicles arrived at the Atta household and blew up the top floor. According to Muhammad Atta, the demolition not only took out the top floor of his family's home, where he lived until two years ago when he married his wife, but it rendered the bottom floor uninhabitable. He said a local engineer told him that the explosion damaged the structure of the bottom floor to the point that ""it would not be safe to live"" there. Standing next to the remains of his family's home, Atta asked why his family had to pay the price of his brother Osama's actions, who, along with two of his neighbors, Adel Ankoush and Bara Salah, carried out a coordinated attack in two locations near Jerusalem's Old City in mid-June, killing St.-Sgt. Hadas Malka and wounding others. Osama, Ankoush and Salah all were shot dead while carrying out the attack. ""We had no idea that Osama was going to carry out an attack. And if we had known, we would have stopped him. We are absolutely against violence.... She [Malka] had a mother just as Osama had a mother. She did not deserve to die and had a life to live,"" Muhammad said last week with a look of exhaustion on his face ... In Israel, demolishing homes of attackers' families is not straightforward. While the government and security services officially support the policy and hold that it establishes a deterrent against would-be attackers, a number of former IDF generals argue otherwise ... A recent study conducted by Hebrew University professors and another Northwestern University professor complements Akerman's conclusions. The study contends that ""punitive house demolitions lead to fewer suicide attacks in the month following demolitions,"" stating that ""a one standard deviation increase in punitive house demolitions leads to a decrease of 11.7% in the number of suicide terrorists originating from an average district."" Nonetheless, a number of other voices in Israel's security establishment question Akerman's and the recent study's conclusions. A former senior IDF officer, who served in a prominent role in the West Bank, said that ""the conclusion is that home demolitions do not deter terrorists."" ... ""Frankly, I think politicians use home demolitions as a way to placate the public,"" he said ... ""We found that it really was not an effective way of establishing deterrence,"" a member of the IDF committee, who agreed to speak anonymously, stated. ""[Home demolitions] actually created a great amount of fury among the Palestinians, and we even thought at times the policy had the opposite effect of deterrence."" He added: ""We also thought that it was not worth the price the army paid in its image.""....

Press freedom in Palestine: condemned to self-censor

Qantara (Germany) 4 Sept by Inge Gunther -- To this day, the five Palestinian journalists have not been told why they were detained two weeks ago. They spent a week behind bars at a Palestinian Authority jail on the West Bank. The five, who work for opposition online media including outlets loyal to Hamas, have now been released. But speaking after his release, one member of the group Kotaibeh Kasem, a freelancer from Bethlehem, said he had at no point been confronted with concrete accusations. He went on to say that he has had frequent run-ins with President Mahmoud Abbas' security authorities. And on this occasion, he immediately suspected ""that this was a political detention.""To put it bluntly, it could be said that the five journalists served Palestinian security agencies as a kind of bargaining chip to force Hamas in Gaza to free a reporter associated with Fatah. Fouad Jaradeh, Gaza correspondent for ""Palestine TV"", the news channel associated with Abbas, had been thrown in jail by Hamas police around two months ago. They finally released him in mid-August, whereupon autonomy government authorities released the aforementioned five journalists from detention. It is well-known that Hamas does not balk at the idea of hostage-taking. But now, it would appear that West Bank security agencies trained by the EU and the U.S. are also resorting to mafia-style methods to put pressure on Islamist rulers in Gaza. ""It can't really be described any other way,"" says Shawan Jabarin, director of the Al-Haq civil rights organisation in Ramallah and adds: ""arbitrary arrests under any random pretext are a crime."" Under such circumstances, Palestinian journalists have little opportunity to carry out independent reporting, even if they are not affiliated to either Fatah or Hamas....

PA arrests radio station chairman who publicly denounced Abbas

JPost 4 Sept by Adam Rasgon -The Palestinian Authority Preventative Security arrested Ayman Qawasmeh, the chairman of the Minbar al-Huriyya radio station, in Hebron late Sunday evening, a senior PA security official said on Monday. Qawasmeh's arrest came some three days after he made disparaging comments of PA President Mahmoud Abbas and PA Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah. In a fit of frustration, Qawasmeh on Thursday called on Abbas and Hamdallah to resign after the IDF raided his radio station in Hebron and confiscated equipment, accusing them of failing to protect PA -controlled areas in the West Bank. An IDF spokeswoman said security services raided the radio station because it was inciting violence, a charge that Qawasmeh has denied. ""I call on PA President Mahmoud Abbas and the prime minister to submit their resignations and not to remain in their positions,"" Qawasmeh said in a video that was widely shared on social media. ""[To] he who cannot protect his institutions and people, I say to them, sit in your house."" The PA is technically in charge of security inside major West Bank cities like Hebron, but the IDF frequently enters them to carry out arrests and confiscate equipment. A senior official in the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate who is following Qawasmeh's case said that Qawasmeh was arrested because of the remarks he made about Abbas and Hamdallah while technically serving as a member of the PA security services. According to a member of Qawasmeh's family, the radio station chairman served for a number of years in the PA security services, but resigned before municipal elections took place last May ... Members of the PA security forces, similar to many other security services around the world, are not allowed to take public positions on political issues. However, Hisham Sharabati, a political analyst and activist in the West Bank, said that the PA only upholds that standard when it pertains to itself or Fatah, the West Bank's ruling party. ""I have heard Ayman Qawasmeh criticize Hamas and the Popular Front [for the Liberation of Palestine] many times on the radio,"" Sharabati said. ""So why did the PA arrest him only after he made his recent statements about Abbas and Hamdallah? Where were they when he made the statements about Hamas and the PFLP?""

A young Palestinian writer's suicide sparks mental illness debate

StepFeed 1 Sept by Mariam Nabbout -- Earlier this week, a promising young Palestinian student and writer ended his own life, sending shockwaves through his community in Gaza, Palestine. According to Gaza's police chief, Ayman Al Batneeji, 22-year-old Mohanad Younes died after inhaling poisonous gas. Soon after news of Younes' suicide began to circulate online, thousands shared moving tributes to the young man. But his death also sparked debate over mental illness in Gaza and the Arab world, leading thousands to discuss a dangerous, collective sense of hopelessness that currently affects millions of young people across the region. Younes was a university student, studying pharmacy at Al-Azhar university. He was also a promising young writer who rose to fame after he won first place in a literary competition in 2015 for ""A Search for Warmth"" - a short story he had written. In recent months, Mohanad won several other important literary awards including one awarded by Gaza's Ministry of Education. After his untimely death, several of the young writer's relatives took to social media, sharing different versions of stories that hinted at what might have led Mohanad to take his own life. His uncle, Asaad Ghurab, said that the young man decided to commit suicide due to familial issues related to his father, who had abandoned Mohanad many years back. Others explained that the young man's decision was caused by an accumulation of factors which include severe depression ... As devastating as it is, Mohanad's suicide is not an isolated case, and he possibly reflects the plight of thousands of people in the Arab world who often suffer in silence. In many countries all over the Arab world, the mere discussion of any mental health issue is still considered a taboo. Even though it's common across the region, there's still a lot of stigma attached to mental illness, in addition to numerous social restrictions, misconceptions, and myths. These factors often discourage those affected from seeking necessary treatment that is crucial, especially in a region where youth are becoming less optimistic. Amid skyrocketing rates of unemployment, poverty, and violence that are all widespread across the region, it comes as no surprise that the Middle East has also seen a ""sharp increase"" in mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia....

Skateboarding camp helps Palestinians see beyond West Bank walls

[with video] QALQILYA, West Bank (NBC News) 2 Sept by Petra Cahill & Lawahez Jabari -- Residents in this Palestinian city never see the sunset; Israel's imposing security wall blocks the view towards the west, and much else. Now, a skateboarding summer camp in Qalqilya is helping kids to see a new horizon. ""When you get on the skateboard, you don't think about all the problems you have. All you're focused on is that you have to stay on the board and not fall,"" said Abdullah Milhem, a 17-year-old from Qalqilya who first picked up a skateboard five years ago. He says his hobby has changed his life and gave him a positive outlet for his energy instead of hanging out on the streets or getting involved in drugs or violence. ""You have this feeling of flying,"" said Milhem. ""You have this feeling like you can do anything."" That's exactly the kind of empowerment the organizers of the nonprofit camp, SkateQilya, are hoping to foster by using the skateboard as a tool to teach independence, creativity and leadership skills to young Palestinians in the West Bank, which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war ... The camp is focused on what organizers see as three integrated activities: Reed teaches the kids how to skateboard, Abel leads photography and videography classes and Othman does community building -- teaching boys and girls to work and play together -- as well as leadership training.

Palestinians working for foreign companies causing 'brain drain' in West Bank

The Media Line 6 Sept by Dima Abumaria -- The Israeli-Palestinian peace process may be at an impasse, but that has not stopped Israeli hi-tech companies from recruiting Palestinian programmers and engineers from across the divide. Over the past three years, Palestinian entrepreneurs have created more than seven hundred jobs in the local hi-tech market; however, some professionals are instead opting to work for Israeli companies or projects, a ""brain-drain"" that has resulted in a lack of technical expertise in the West Bank. Shadi Atshan, President of the Ramallah-based Leaders organization, which manages the ""Fast Forward"" start-up incubator for hi-tech entrepreneurs, explained that many Palestinians opt to work in Israel because the salaries are unmatched.""Israeli companies pay them double or triple than what a Palestinian start-up can pay,"" he explained to The Media Line. Specifically, Atshan said that Palestinian hi-tech companies can generally offer a ""maximum salary of seven hundred dollars per month and potentially some shares in the business, whereas Israeli companies offer between $2,500-$4,000 monthly depending on the position and its demands.""....

Opinion: Condemnations of Israeli occupation aren't enough / Amira Hass

Haaretz 6 Sept -- Holland, Belgium and France: It's not enough to condemn with just words the Israeli policy of destruction, which damages equipment and buildings funded with your taxpayers' money. It's good that you are angry, but the pace of the accumulation of your anger lags far behind the galloping and dangerous pace of the bulldozers of the Civil Administration in the West Bank and the Settlements Defense Forces. The condemnations are seen as lacking urgency. You must take real actions. Yes, open and declared sanctions that have a path to becoming more severe. Painful sanctions. This may be the last chance to remove the average Israeli, including business people, tourists, judges, scholars, farmers and foreign soccer consumers from their indifference and criminal complacency. Stop being afraid of Israeli emotional blackmail. Israel trades in the memory of our families murdered in Europe in order to speed up the expulsion of the Palestinians from the bulk of West Bank territory to the enclaves of the Palestinian Authority. This is the intention behind all the demolitions and confiscations and bans on construction, herding and field irrigation. Whoever plans and implements this small, gradual expulsion is already thinking about the big expulsion, to Jordan. And what will you do then? Issue condemnations and send water tankers and tents to those expelled?....

Jewish Voice for Peace tells teens not to go on Birthright

The Forward 4 Sept by JTA -- The pro-Palestinian group Jewish Voice for Peace is calling on young Jewish adults to eschew the free trip to the Jewish state offered by Birthright Israel. The organization calls on the young Jews to reject Birthright Israel using the slogan #ReturnTheBirthright. A manifesto on the organization's website reads: ""(T)oday, we must acknowledge that the modern state of Israel is predicated on the ongoing erasure of Palestinians. Taking a Birthright trip today means playing an active role in helping the state promote Jewish ""return"" while rejecting the Palestinian right of return. It is not enough to accept this offer from the Israeli government and maintain a critical perspective while on the trip. We reject the offer of a free trip to a state that does not represent us, a trip that is only ""free"" because it has been paid for by the dispossession of Palestinians. And as we reject this, we commit to promoting the right to return of Palestinian refugees."" The manifesto concludes: ""There are other ways for us to strengthen our Jewish identities, in community with those who share our values. Israel is not our Birthright."" The eligible Jewish young people, ages 18-26 years old, are also asked to sign a petition which reads: ""We are Birthright-eligible Jews between the ages of 18 and 26. We pledge that we will not go on a Birthright trip because it is fundamentally unjust that we are given a free trip to Israel, while Palestinian refugees are barred from returning to their homes."" Some 600,000 Jewish young adults have visited Israel on the 10-day, all expenses paid trips funded by private donors and the Israeli government.

In the interview, published by the Jerusalem Post on Friday, David Friedman also claimed that US President Donald Trump - who is his close friend - will eventually deliver on his campaign promise and move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem ...

99,99,"SANTA FE, N.M. â"" A techno-infused opera about the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs has earned the financial backing of opera companies in San Francisco and Seattle, ensuring the musical meditation on the iconic entrepreneur will travel to America's high-tech enclave.

The partnerships were announced Tuesday as the Santa Fe Opera prepared for its July world premiere of ""The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs"" at its open-air summer stage in the foothills of New Mexico's Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

The Seattle Opera and the San Francisco Opera are underwriting both the already completed artistic creation of the opera, led by composer and electronica DJ Mason Bates, and its physical stage production. As co-producers, the companies guarantee their right to performances beyond Santa Fe in California and Washington. The Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University also has signed on as a co-producer.

Job's life story, as the relentless technology pioneer who embraced Buddhism and simple vegetarian family dinners, has been the subject of documentaries, books, a feature film and a graphic novel since his death from cancer in 2011.

Sponsors of the Jobs opera are counting on Bates and librettist Mark Campbell to deliver a ""deeply layered, moving portrayal of a man grappling with the complex priorities of life, family and work,"" in the words of San Francisco opera General Manager Matthew Shilvock.

""He was also a real person and a member of our community,"" Shilvock said of Jobs in a written announcement.

Charles MacKay, general director of the Santa Fe Opera, said Jobs provides the ""sort of heroic, tragic figure"" that operas have explored for centuries â"" who also may lure new and younger audiences to metropolitan opera houses.

""The proof is in the pudding and in how the audience responds,"" MacKay told the Associated Press. ""This is not an opera about technology, although it will be the highest technology production that we've ever done. It is an opera about relationships, and it is an opera about human frailties. ... He could be a very difficult man.""

Accompaniments include a live orchestra, guitar, natural sounds and expressive electronics â"" sounds tailored to the man who first won fame and fortune during the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 80s with partner Steve Wozniak as they introduced the pivotal Apple II and Macintosh computers.

Fired by Apple in 1984, Jobs went into the visual effects industry at Pixar before his return to Apple as CEO to preside over the heyday of the early iPhone and related gadgets â"" also becoming a music and media mogul.

MacKay cautioned that ""The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs"" could take a few years to reach the Bay Area and beyond â"" normal delays in the painstaking opera planning cycle.

Investments as a co-producer can pay financial dividends if the opera sells tickets and eventually travels the country, or world. The Santa Fe Opera brokered a collaborative hit with other companies with the 2015 opera premiere of ""Cold Mountain,"" adapted from the 1997 novel and popular film.

Seed money for the Jobs opera was provided by the National Endowment for the Arts.

From Santa Fe, MacKay has been outspoken in pushing back against President Donald Trump's proposed elimination of the endowment from the federal budget, with funding recently extended through the end of the current fiscal year in September."

Richard M. Dalton

Richard M. Dalton, resident of Morgan County, died at home on August 31, 2017 after an extended

battle with cancer which he fought with grace and courage. Richard was born in Osborn, Ohio (now Fairborn, Ohio) on January 25, 1931, son of Olen and Angie Dalton. He attended Bath Township Elementary and High School where he graduated in 1949. During his primary school years in addition to academic studies, he was active in football, band, orchestra, dance band, barbershop quartet and chorus. Richard attended the University of Dayton where he was a member of the marching band. He graduated from Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration and a Second Lieutenant Commission in the United States Air Force. He served five years in the Air Force, two of which were in Sidi Slimane, Morocco. After leaving the Air Force in 1960, Richard started his career at IBM in Dayton, Ohio. He retired from IBM in Atlanta, after a successful career of 32 years. In retirement, he has lived at Lake Lanier, Lake Oconee and finally on a small plot of 17 acres in Morgan County. During his lifetime, Richard has been involved in many church, civic, community and political activities, where he often served in leadership roles. Richard was interested in many things, including music, working with his hands, photography, duplicate bridge, computers, boating, reading, traveling, the theater, and neighborhood get-togethers. He especially enjoyed his final years doing home projects with his beloved friends and neighbors in the wonderful community of Sweetbriar. Richard is survived by his wife Sheila of 39 years, his daughter Sandra Dalton Job-Rivera, his son David Scott Dalton (Chris), four grandchildren Cameron Dalton (Kelly), Jessica Job, Stuart Dalton (Kate), Caroline Filacchione (Tyler), and great granddaughters Morgan and Brooke Dalton. His youngest son, Jeffrey Spencer predeceased him in 2007. Richard was a Christian who had a strong belief in God and in God's Nature. He was especially grateful for God's gift of freedom to mankind.

Peter Hicks

Peter Hicks, the 58-year-old father of four children, died Aug. 26, 2017, after a short illness. Peter was born in Canada, but he had lived in Georgia for much of his adult life and he considered Madison his home.

Peter worked in retail for most of his life and was a long-time employee of Big Lots. At the time of his death, he was the manager of the Monroe Big Lots. Though he worked a difficult and ever-changing schedule, he made time for family, golf, cooking and brewing beer. He could come across as gruff at times, but those close to him knew he had a soft spot for the underdogs of this world, especially the four-legged kind. Like his father, he was a tinkerer, but the act of fixing things could also bring out the saltiest of language if things weren't going smoothly. In fact, he fixed a lot of things, but his solutions weren't always pretty -- and he privately liked it that way. He didn't believe that following the traditional path was all it was cracked up to be.

He was an avid Maple Leafs and Falcons fan. Growing up, he'd been good at any sport he set his mind to, but it was golf that captured his heart in the long run. If the weather was good (and sometimes, even if it wasn't), he squeezed in a round of golf on his days off. He also had an appreciation of history and he liked to cook, especially when his kids were around.

He is survived by his four children -- Chris Hicks, Lisa Houston, Ian Hicks and Adam Hicks -- and three siblings -- Anne Hicks, Simon Hicks and Sarah Hicks. He was preceded in death by his wife, Tery Tingle Hicks.

The family will hold a small, private gathering in his honor in Atlanta on Sept. 8.

In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the Melanoma Research Foundation (https://www.melanoma.org/)

Dr. Glenn Earl Dix

Dr. Glenn Earl Dix, 89 resident of Madison since 1954, passed away August 27, 2017. Glenn was born March 24, 1928 in Binghamton, NY to Earl and Rose Dix. Glenn served as a missionary at Source of Light Ministries International in Madison for 10 years, as CEO and General Director for 38 years, and as Director Emeritus for 15 years. Glenn traveled representing the ministry in conferences and churches in the US and around the globe and continued to do so until recent years. He loved to garden, ski, play tennis, raise horses, and play with his grandchildren. But his real loves were prayer, preaching, singing and his dear wife Joyce who preceded him in death.

Glenn is survived by two sisters, Carolyn Darrow and Rose Nabinger, a daughter Jeanne Barnes, and four sons Glenn, Daniel, Donald, and James. Glenn was proud of his 18 grandchildren and 23 great-grandchildren.

A memorial celebration of the lives and ministries of Dr. Glenn and Joyce Dix will be held Saturday, September 9 at 1 p.m. at Source of Light Ministries International at 1011 Mission Rd., Madison, GA 30650.

101,101,"Dunkirk, as memorialized in arguably the best movie of the summer, foreshadowed the catastrophic events wrought by Hurricane Harvey in Texas. The Christopher Nolan masterpiece recounted the heroic events in May of 1940, when at the outset of World War II, the English citizenry rallied to the rescue of more than 330,000 British and French troops who were trapped on a beach in northern France. While some of those soldiers could almost see home across the English Channel, the shallow waters prevented their rescue by warships. Instead, it was a flotilla of nearly 700 civilian craft -- the Little Ships of Dunkirk -- that made their way from Ramsgate in England to assist with the rescue.

And so it was in Texas. In Houston, civilian volunteers created patchwork flotillas composed of dinghies, jet skis, rafts, and fishing boats in an effort to ferry hundreds of residents to safety. A health-care worker named Jeremy Sparkman told Reuters: ""I usually just use this boat for drinking beer, but we come together when we need to -- that's what Texans do."" Indeed. And when the Harris County Department of Homeland Security asked for volunteers one day after the storm's landing, hundreds of boat owners responded to the call, and supply soon exceeded demand.

The Texas flotilla was an American Dunkirk, minus the aerial bombardment. So just for a moment, can we celebrate the human spirit that we all watched play out in the Lone Star State?

Those like Adam Brackman. The 41-year-old bar owner in Houston commandeered a civilian boat -- a 16-foot flat-bottom fishing boat -- and set about rescuing neighbors.

""I made a post on Facebook and next thing I know I'm getting 100 texts an hour,"" he told me. ""When my boat captain wanted to call it quits at the end of the day I jumped on a bigger boat and helped them navigate.""

By day two, with the arrival of police and the Coast Guard, things were more orderly. But the distress calls didn't stop.

""I kept getting messages, and this one stuck: 'Woman and mother trapped in attic. Bring ax.' I drive as close as I could and waded through chest-high water to get to her house. The water was down enough so we could walk in the house and extract them. They had been there for two days. An 80-year-old woman with Alzheimer's and breast cancer and her daughter with four dogs and three cats. After waiting a bit, the fire department showed up and helped us get them all down. The mother was floated off to hospital in the next-door neighbor's kayak, but the daughter wanted to stay at home with the pets. We advised her against it, told her it would rise again, but she was adamant that she wanted to stay. We went about our day and helped others. At 11 p.m. I had wrapped up and showered and was working at home and got a call from her that the waters are rising and she was ready for the evacuation. We went and got them all out as the waters were rising.""

Brackman was fortunate in that his own home was not damaged, he never lost power, and had use of the internet, which he said was integral to relief efforts.

""Social media was a game-changer,"" he said. ""Without the internet, we would have seen multiples of the final death count. The walkie-talkie Zello app in particular allowed us to match boats with those who needed rescue. One of the most moving things was how friends saw what I was doing on social media and jumped in to help with their own trucks, boats, kayaks, or computers.""

There are many like him to venerate: The first responders. Those who risked their lives for strangers. Neighbors who opened their homes to those who required shelter from the storm. Heroics to save the lives of pets! The many who undertook fund-raising tasks and the many more who responded to those calls. And those dozen or so whom CNN televised after they formed a human chain to wade into waist-deep water to save an elderly man whose SUV was submerged on the Houston interstate.

There was something missing from that dramatic rescue: No one asked the man how he was registered to vote nor requested to see his immigration papers. And for several days, there was similarly an absence of partisan rancor. Not even a trumped-up debate between the Democratic Houston mayor and the Republican governor of Texas over evacuation took hold. Instead, after the storm, politics immediately was secondary to saving lives and protecting property.

The wind and waters of Hurricane Harvey didn't discriminate. They lashed Republicans, Democrats, and independents. Young and old. The rich and poor, the black, white, Asian, and Hispanic.

Here's hoping its legacy is a reminder of all that unites us.

103,103,"MIT research scientist Hugh Herr lost both legs below the knee after a 1982 winter climbing ordeal. In less than a year, he hacked his prosthetics to allow him to climb again, and he went on to become one of the world's leading innovators in the field. Author Todd Balf, who lost partial use of his legs after a spinal-cord injury, gets a front-row seat as Herr plots his next big act -- a $100 million project to end a slate of disabling conditions.

I can see him in his glass-fronted Cambridge office from the foosball table in the light-filled central atrium. He's standing there talking to a visitor and seems to be finishing up. This entire side of the third floor in MIT's new Media Lab building is partitioned with glass, and professor Hugh Herr and his colleagues and whatever madness they're up to in their offices and the open, gadget-filled, lower-floor lab are on display. Several people, myself included, are peering down, hoping to see a bit of magic.

Months ago, when I e-mailed Herr to propose writing an article about him, I told him about my rare bone cancer and resulting partial paralysis below the waist as a way to explain my interest in his work. Though I didn't tell him this, I also harbored a secret wish that he could help me. People write to Herr, a 52-year-old engineer and biophysicist, daily about his inspiring example. They've heard him promise an end to disability. They have conditions that medicine can't fix and futures they can't stand to consider. They're wishing for his intervention, wanting of hope. Crossing his threshold, I'm the lucky one. I'm here.

Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more longform titles.

Herr welcomes me into his office, a clean, well-ordered space. There's a round glass table with a laptop on it, a handful of hard office chairs, and a pair of prosthetic legs Herr designed that are arranged like statuary behind us, one in either corner. Above us on a wall looms a large mounted photograph of another pair of prosthetics. These are hand-carved from solid ash, with vines and flowers and six-inch heels. The real-life legs were famously worn by a friend of Herr's, the amputee track-and-field athlete and actress Aimee Mullins.

I have hobbled into Herr's office with a dented $20 stock metal cane on one side and a foot-lifting Blue Rocker brace on the other. (The dent is from my recently firing the cane at the wall.) I had imagined Herr noticing the cane and asking more about my story to see how he could fix me, like he has fixed so many others. The moment I realize that the meeting I'd imagined isn't the meeting we're going to have -- I'm here as a reporter, not a friend or patient, after all -- I start to stammer. Herr deftly resets the conversation by suggesting we look at his computer.

On it are the PowerPoint slides of his next big project, a breathtaking $100 million, five-year proposal focused on paralysis, depression, amputation, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease. The work will be funneled through Herr's new brainchild, MIT's Center for Extreme Bionics, a team of faculty and researchers assembled in 2014 that he codirects. After exploring various interventions for each condition, Herr and his colleagues will apply to the FDA to conduct human trials. One to-be-explored intervention in the brain might, with the right molecular knobs turned, augment empathy. ""If we increase human empathy by 30 percent, would we still have war?"" Herr asks. ""We may not.""

As he continues with the presentation he's been giving to technologists, engineers, health researchers, and potential donors -- last December alone, he keynoted in Dubai, Istanbul, and Las Vegas -- each revolutionary intervention he mentions yields a boyish grin and a look that affirms: Yes, you heard that right. In a talk I hear him give a few weeks ­later, he'll dare to characterize incurable paralysis as ""low-hanging fruit."" In his outspoken willingness to fix everything, even things that some argue should be left alone, he knows how he sounds. ""If half the audience is frightened and the other half is intrigued, I know I've done a good job,"" he says.

Herr calmly ticks off one condition after another. He shows me an animation of an innovative surgery that will restore an amputee's lost proprioception, giving a person the ability to feel and control a prosthetic as if it were their own limb. In another slide, of a paralyzed man in a bulky walk-assisting exoskeleton suit, he asks me to imagine a futuristic treatment that uses light to control cells in muscle tissue. Then he presents a video clip of a rat with a severed spinal cord dragging around its paralyzed hind legs.

Having dragged my mostly unresponsive left leg around for two years, I think I know something about the rodent's life. In the next clip, however, that rat, just 90 days later, is walking on all fours. A team at the MIT center led by Herr's colleague Robert Langer successfully regrew the rat's spinal cord by implanting a dissolvable scaffold seeded with neural stem cells. In Herr's world, the limbless can be whole again, the paralyzed can walk. Making the extraordinary seem ordinary is maybe the whole point.

Herr himself is proof positive. Trim, fit, and handsome, he is the showpiece for the Center for Extreme Bionics. ""I'm kind of what they're selling,"" he says. The fuss over Herr has been building for decades but reached new levels in 2014, courtesy of his TED Talk, which has now been viewed in excess of 7.3 million times. In it, Herr describes the horrific 1982 winter climbing accident in New Hampshire's White Mountains during which he suffered severe frostbite, leading to the amputation of both legs below the knee. Then 17, Herr was told he'd never climb again. Instead, he rebuilt himself almost immediately, willfully reshaping his artificial legs and realizing that he wasn't handicapped, ""the technology was.""

By hacking his prosthetic devices for his ""vertical world,"" he was able to quickly return to climbing, becoming the first athlete -- decades before Oscar Pistorius -- to blur the line between para and not. His accomplishments landed him on the cover of Outside a year after his accident, something that sticks with him not because of the many accolades other climbers bestowed on him, or even the controversy it reignited around the tragic death of one of his rescuers, but because of the questions the article raised about how far Herr would be able to go. ""I was a sad case. I was going to end up in this machine shop, disabled,"" Herr recalls of the piece, pausing to let the perceived insult ripen in his mind. ""Yeah, it's a real sad story.""

The triumphant, fully realized man in the TED Talk is a marvel. His outrage at the unnecessary suffering from disability is fiercely personal. What first-time viewers like me invariably fixate on is the way Herr gracefully owns the stage. He's wearing pants that end above the knee, revealing shimmering high-tech silver and black prosthetics. Herr is focused on what he's saying, not what his artificial legs are doing. The crime of physical impairment is that it often steals from a person's sense of self. If you didn't look below his knees, you'd never guess that Herr is missing half of each leg. He walks through the world the way we all would hope to.

He has effectively ended his disability, or at least the perception of it, just as he said he would. Inspired by his accident, he earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering at MIT in 1993, followed by a Ph.D. at Harvard in biophysics. Ever since, Herr has produced a string of breakthrough products, starting with a computer-controlled artificial knee in 2003. In 2004, he created the biomecha­tronics group at MIT, a now 40-person R&D lab drawing on the fields of biology, mechanics, and electronics to restore function to those who've lost it. Three years later, the team produced a powered ankle-foot prosthesis that allows an amputee to walk with speed and effort comparable to those with biological legs. Called the emPower, the apparatus weighs a few pounds and houses 12 sensors, three computers, tensioning springs, and muscle-tendon actuators. The ankle system is manufactured by a private company Herr started called BionX.

Last year, Herr advanced another of his lab's goals, to improve human performance ""beyond what nature intends"" by creating a brace-like exoskeleton device that reduces the metabolic cost of walking. The implications for people who want to get places faster -- or perhaps a soldier trying to conserve energy on a long march -- are vast.

In the near future, Herr and his colleagues at the MIT center are committed to, among other things, reversing paralysis. Herr's goal is to develop a synthetic spinal cord that

aids the damaged original. A prosthesis, in other words.

In his office, Herr draws up his pant leg and rolls down a silicone sleeve to show me a newly developed fabric that lines the socket of his prosthetic and cushions the problematic intersection between the biological stump and the man-made limb. The ""exquisitely comfortable"" fit -- digitally derived, he explains, but highly personal -- is something he delights over with a savoring gush.

With our first meeting nearing its end, I grow distracted thinking about the wounded few Herr has smiled upon. In 2014, he worked on a bionic prosthetic for the dancer Adrianne Haslet-Davis, who lost her left leg in the Boston Marathon bombing. Currently, he's working with Hari Budha Magar, a double-amputee former Gurkha soldier who plans to climb Mount Everest in 2018, and also Jim Ewing, an old New Hampshire climbing buddy. Ewing was climbing a wall on vacation in the Cayman Islands in 2014 when he fell with his teen daughter on belay. She couldn't brake the rope, and he plummeted some 60 feet, shattering his pelvis and left foot on impact.

The dancer, the Gurkha, the climber, and Herr himself are examples of what he often describes as the millions of humans who might appear broken but are not. Haslet-Davis, on a bionic limb embedded with dance intelligence, brilliantly performed the rumba again, and Ewing underwent a pioneering amputation procedure developed by Herr's biomechatronics team in partnership with MIT colleague and surgeon Matthew Carty, who performed the operation at Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital, to prepare Ewing for an advanced prosthesis. Magar will be outfitted with short prosthetics to reduce leg drag and sophisticated crutches for speed as he attempts Everest history.

The stories Herr tells, the future he sees, the beautifully functioning artificial limb before me -- it's all I can do not to show him my atrophied left leg and ask for his godlike intervention to fix what I know is broken. But I don't, not yet.

When I wrote Herr to tell him about my interest in his work, I summarized my case history. I explained how in the summer of 2014, I found myself with increasingly debilitating nerve and lower-back pain. When I finally got an MRI, I learned that I had an extremely rare bone cancer called chor­doma that had spread from my lower lumbar vertebrae into my right hip flexor. Radiation and a difficult multi-stage surgery successfully removed the softball-size tumor, but months later, possibly due to a loss of blood to the spinal cord, I'd yet to regain sensation or strength in my hips and legs. The doctors didn't know if it was permanent, but the prognosis didn't look good.

I'd expected a rapid, maybe even exceptional recovery. I am an athlete and adventurer who has had the good fortune to do a lot of cool stuff over the years. I'd become a whitewater guide, climbed Grand Teton, raced the hill climb at Mount Washington on foot and by bike, and mountain-biked half the 3,000-mile-plus Great Divide route. I expected to complete the other half someday.

I'd progressed from a walker to a cane, from a recumbent tricycle to a pedal-assist e-bike. Then my nerve regeneration halted. In May 2015, after the surgery, I'd contacted Boston neurologist Bill David for muscle and nerve testing. An avid cyclist and kindred spirit, he'd hopefully stuck needles into my skin every six months to chart my recovery. Late last year, he confirmed what I had already sensed. Short of a miracle, I'd gone about as far as I could. ""I really wish that we had met on a mountain or river as opposed to a medical clinic,"" David said.

I'd negotiated several stages of recovery, but the one I feared most was right now -- at the end, my future fixed. ""I've been coming to grips with who I am as an 'incomplete' paraplegic and figuring out how to make the best version of this new person,"" I wrote

to Herr.

I'd imagined a stirring epilogue to our encounters, a moment perhaps when a radical trial arose and a crazy volunteer was needed. To be closer to the person I once was, I would try anything -- injected viruses, exoskeletal suits, implants. When I got together with a close friend for lunch, I told her how the story with Herr was progressing, and how the limbs he created were so advanced that I'd read about people wanting them even though their leg complications didn't medically require amputation. She listened carefully. ""Let me ask you something,"" she said. ""Would you, um, get your legs cut off?""

Exactly when in his childhood Hugh Herr decided to become the world's best climber is impossible to pinpoint, but the goal was nurtured during family road trips across the West. He and his older brothers climbed, fished, and hiked in the American and Canadian Rockies, whetting the youthful Herr's appetite for adventure. The Shawangunk Mountains in New York were a four-and-a-half-hour drive from the Herrs' home in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The Gunks were an emerging mecca in the seventies, and Herr quickly established himself as a prodigy, ""climbing this stuff when I was 11 that only adults had done, and at 15 that no one else had done,"" he says.

When he and Jeff Batzer, a friend from Lancaster, drove to New Hampshire's Mount Washington in January 1982 for a weekend ice-climbing outing, it wasn't to do anything audacious. They'd attempt a classic route in Huntington's Ravine, and maybe, depending on the weather and avalanche conditions, summit Mount Washington before racing down for the 12-hour drive home. Herr was a 17-year-old junior in high school, his friend Batzer, 20.

The decision to tack on the summit of Washington turned out to be a tragic mistake. They left a sleeping bag and bivy sack behind to reduce weight but encountered howling winds and blizzard conditions near the top, and they ended up losing their way, mistakenly descending into a different valley from where they'd come.

After four days trekking through a storm in deep snow and below-freezing temperatures to find their way out, Herr was no longer able to walk. Early on in the odyssey, he had punched through a frozen streambed into shin-deep water, soaking his boots and pants, and was suffering from severe frostbite. In Second Ascent, a biography by Alison Osius, Herr said that he had reconciled himself to death when a backcountry snowshoer saw some of Batzer's tracks and followed them to a makeshift shelter the two were bivouacked in. The climbers were evacuated to a nearby hospital in Littleton, where doctors treated both for hypothermia and frostbite. Herr's legs were in terrible shape. At the hospital, he learned that doctors might not be able to save them and that a member of his search party, a 28-year-old climbing-school instructor named Albert Dow, had been killed in an avalanche. Two months later, doctors amputated Herr's legs four inches below the knee. Batzer's fingers on his right hand were amputated, along with his left foot and the toes on his right foot.

""I asked my doctor after the amputation what I'd be able to do with my new body,"" Herr recalls. ""The doctor said, 'What do you want to do?' I said I wanted to drive a car, ride my bike, and climb. The doctor said you'll be able to drive a car, but with hand controls. He said I would not be able to ride a bike or return to climbing.""

Herr did all of the above within a year. He worked closely with his prosthetist on one pair of artificial legs after another and tinkered on his own in the machine shop of a vocational school he'd begun attending in 1981. He soon figured out that he could hack his artificial limbs to suit the requirements of particular climbing routes. He built limbs that extended or shortened his stature; he carved out feet with wedge ends to slice into crevices. He began to knock off routes that he hadn't been able to do previously, including leading an ascent of Vandals at Skytop, the first 5.13 on the East Coast. It ignited a new controversy: that his adaptations were a form of cheating. Herr likes to tell audiences that he invited his affronted rivals to chop off their own legs.

""Some people were bitter and angry"" about the accident, says Jim Ewing, a summer roommate of Herr's in the 1980s, ""and with Hugh coming back and climbing so well, they started making up excuses, saying things like, 'He can stand on a dime, his feet don't get sore, he doesn't have calf fatigue.' I'd just look at these people and think, By God, you haven't seen this guy crawl to the toilet in the middle of the night because he doesn't have his legs on. He is handicapped; it is a handicap. People had no idea.""

While there was a lot of media attention about Herr's accident, he kept private the struggles and self-doubt he faced after he lost his legs. When he returned to New Hampshire to climb again 18 months later, the unease from locals over Dow's death and Herr's resurgence was palpable.

The harsh early views of Herr didn't soon go away. When I asked him what he thought when the American Alpine Club last year honored him at a celebratory awards evening in Denver, he said he was stunned. They had named him a new inductee of the Hall of Mountaineering Excellence ""for lasting contributions on and off the mountain."" ""It shocked me,"" he said. ""The initial story line of the accident was that these young, irresponsible, incompetent climbers caused the death of an experienced, beloved local climber. That narrative went on for a very long time. So for two decades at least, I wouldn't even expect the American Alpine Club to invite me to be in the audience.""

When Herr talks about Albert Dow, who he never met, it's with the fondness of a friend. ""That was Albert!"" he recounts about Dow's insistence that he go looking for Herr and Batzer because he'd want someone to do the same for him. Last year, Herr told a Reddit audience that he strives to honor Dow. ""I hate the idea that his death somehow enabled me to live so I could do good work,"" he says. ""What I like is that his kindness and who he was -- and his sacrifice -- inspired me to work really hard.""

In 1985, Herr free-climbed New Hampshire's exceptionally steep and unpro­tected Stage Fright, with his friend Jim Surette on belay. It was a significant and life-threatening milestone, and afterward Herr had a dream that set his new path. He describes a nightmare in which Surette, bunking on a neighboring couch, throws off his covers to reveal mangled, bloody, ampu­tated legs. ""We both go 'Aaah!' in the dream,"" says Herr, ""but then I turn to Jimmy and say, 'Don't worry, Jimmy, it's just a dream. I'm the one without legs.' Prior to that, in all my dreams I would be running and jumping, and I would have my biological legs. It was the first time my brain recognized my new state.""

Some might've interpreted the nightmare with melancholy, an attempt to come to terms with a sorrowful lifelong condition. Herr saw it as a beautiful vision.

The auditorium is full at the Princeton, New Jersey, headquarters of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, all 150 in attendance looking stage left as Herr introduces an image of himself in a New Hampshire hospital room decades earlier. ""What do you see?"" he asks.

It is Herr in the moments after his legs have been amputated. The 17-year-old is gazing down at a white sheet and the outline of his stumps. The audience is riveted.

""What do you see?"" he asks again. ""I see a new beginning,"" he declares. ""I see beauty.""

Herr, who prefers to use the term un­usual instead of handicapped or disabled, often says that he wouldn't want his biological legs back. He loves the legs he started building after the accident and has steadily improved upon for the past several decades.

His meteoric rise in academia is almost as improbable as his comeback to elite climbing. ""I actually graduated from high school not being able to take 10 percent of 100,"" he says. ""I had no idea what a percent was."" His older brothers were all in construction. He understood that the family trade was unavailable to him, so he shut himself away and applied the same obsessive focus to science that he'd once reserved for climbing. He read everything he could find and enrolled at the local college, Millersville University.

""We'd watch all these films of animals locomoting to try to learn about motion,"" says Don Eidam, his first adviser at Millers­ville and an unapologetic superfan who writes a newsletter about Herr. ""He'd put all these ideas on my blackboard, and the chalk would literally be disintegrating. He'd call me at midnight with an idea. I've never met anyone so committed or intense.""

In 1991, Herr became the first student from Millersville to be accepted at MIT. The academic degrees, innovations, and honors have since overflowed. He is the holder or coholder of over 100 patents. The powered prosthesis he developed for ankle-foot amputees was the product of a special mind with a special motivation. By copying the behavior of a biologically intact leg, Herr and his biomechatronics lab were able to create a breakthrough replacement. In 2011, Time crowned him the ""leader of the bionic age."" Last year he won Europe's top prize for inventors, the prestigious Princess of Asturias Award.

""In Hugh's mind, he has not successfully innovated until people are able to benefit from his innovation,"" says Tyler Clites, a Harvard-MIT student who has worked in Herr's lab for six years. ""He has said to me, 'Look, Tyler, I've invented hundreds of times, but I've only ever innovated twice.' "" The two items, his prosthetic knee and the ankle-foot, are the only ones commercially available to others.

The idea of an endlessly upgradable human is something Herr feels in his bones. ""I believe in the near future, in a decade or two, when you walk down the streets of Boston, you'll routinely see people wearing bionic systems,"" Herr told ABC News in a 2016 interview. In 100 years, he thinks the human form will be unrecognizable. The inference is that the abnormal will be normal, beauty rethought and reborn. Unusual people like Herr will have come home.

At a small luncheon after his talk in New Jersey, the organizers ask me to say a few words about my condition. I give a five-­minute recap of my struggles with cancer, the spinal-cord complication, and my up-and-down recovery. It is my first time speaking publicly about my situation. As I do, I sneak a glance or two at Herr. I wonder what he thinks hearing me tell my story. He is sitting immediately to my right, raking through a towering salad.

There is no clear signal from him, but I leave feeling that I've pulled ever so slightly into his orbit. I am also beginning to understand the weight he bears of being a savior. A friend who saw his impassioned SXSW talk in 2015 told me how she raced up to thank him afterward, only to encounter a different guy. He was polite but aloof. She was put off, but I think I understand. The man has to set boundaries. He can't save everybody.

You might say that Herr's the sort of disrupter the research world needs, or you might say he's overpromising. One spinal-cord-injury scientist I spoke with wasn't so sure that a bold tech solution is the answer in a field long focused on the biology of nerve regeneration.

Nicholas Negroponte, the cofounder and former director of the MIT Media Lab, says Herr's sense of humor helps him handle any negative commentary. ""It's particularly important when you do and say risky things, some of which invite harsh criticism,"" he says. ""You smile and keep going, because you know you're right.""

A week after his talk in New Jersey, Herr and I meet up at a seafood restaurant near his MIT office. I arrive 30 minutes early, wanting to get situated. Having lived with my disability for some time now, I understand that I can't just sweep in like I used to. Herr, to my surprise, given his packed schedule, arrives ten minutes early.

Herr told me earlier that he rarely pushes himself on climbs anymore. He proudly mentioned his two preteen, homeschooled daughters, who are avid hikers and spend almost every weekend with Herr's former wife, Patricia Ellis Herr, in the White Mountains happily exhausting themselves. They long ago summited Mount Washington and have high-pointed in 46 of the 50 states.

Herr and I talk at length about some of the people he has worked with and why. The Haslet-Davis project took a group from his biomechatronics lab 200 days to create the prosthetic, counting down to the 2014 TED Talk. ""She said she wanted to dance again. I really related,"" he says. He told himself, I'm an MIT professor, I have resources. The timeline was tight enough that there was a TED Talk plan A (with her) and plan B (without). As everyone knows who has watched the video, Herr's team hit its deadline. Haslet-Davis unforgettably danced again, and there wasn't a dry eye because of it.

But as incredible as the moment was, it's a source of frustration that the prosthetic can't be permanently handed over to Haslet-Davis. While Herr would love to give it to her, it's a prototype that would cost millions to reproduce. As for Herr's climbing buddy Jim Ewing, that's a similarly uncertain situation. Months after Ewing had his foot amputated, he was fitted with a newly designed ankle-foot prosthetic that responds to his brain waves and allows him to feel his appendage. It is also a prototype that Ewing will eventually have to return.

Haslet-Davis and Ewing understood that they were part of a research project and wouldn't be able to keep the prototypes. Meanwhile, Herr's knee and ankle prosthetics, which cost tens of thousands of dollars, aren't yet widely covered by insurance and remain too expensive for most who have a need for them. Herr has been in discussions with insurers to try and change that. According to Amputee Coalition of America estimates, there are 185,000 new lower­extremity amputations annually in the U.S. By contrast, there are only 1,700 emPower ankles in circulation right now. About half of them are worn by vets, paid for through reimbursements covered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

""Herr's work is important and coming from a good place,"" says Alisha Sarang-Sieminski, an associate professor of bioengineering at the Massachusetts-based Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, a school involved in numerous projects related to lower-cost accessibility design. ""But people have different needs for different contexts. Also, so much of the high tech is really not accessible to very many people financially. Should people keep building them? Definitely. Should we also explore basic solutions? Yes.""

Still, Ewing's pioneering amputation is a huge success for Herr's group, the Brigham and Women's surgical team, and, most notably, Ewing. When I visited him at a climbing gym near Portland, Maine, he was planning a trip back to the Cayman Islands. For Ewing, the amputation has reduced the acute pain he used to feel in his biological foot and dramatically changed his outlook. He says that after his accident, he contemplated suicide. ""Being alive isn't enough,"" he says. ""Breathing isn't enough. I had to do something. Hugh understood my motivation probably better than I did.""

Herr hadn't seen Ewing for years when he got an e-mail from him asking for advice about his foot. ""He was in a bad place,"" says Herr. ""Also, I really felt for his daughter. I know guilt so well, that poor girl.""

Ewing says that the way he'd set up the ropes is to blame for his daughter's inability to brake the fall. Though she has returned to climbing at the gym and bouldering, she wasn't interested in rope climbing in the accident's aftermath, and Ewing worried that he'd ruined the sport -- a passion they'd shared for years -- for her.

Meanwhile, the gift Herr has given Ewing is exceptional. It might be the first time Herr is not the most technologically advanced lower-limb amputee. Herr often describes himself and others facing disabilities as ""astronauts testing new life-enabling technologies."" As for his own legs, Herr wants to go even further but would need to leave the U.S. to undergo the operation he has in mind. ""I'd love to do it,"" he says, without revealing any details about the procedure. ""I'm just weighing the risk. I definitely don't want to go backwards.""

In the short term, he's using a newly designed set of titanium legs and pushing forward on his work, noting hoped-for funding this year from the military ""to show we can synthetically take over a paralyzed limb."" Herr then asks about my rehabilitation experience. This is finally my chance, I think, to ask if there's anything he can do for me.

I tell him that I identify with amputees and often wonder how some people without legs are more adept than some of us with them. Every time I watch a person with artificial legs walking, I selfishly wonder, Why not me? Why not us? Herr says they have some good ideas but acknowledges that the field has been way more successful in the amputation arena than with spinal-cord injuries. ""It's hard,"" he says.

While Herr has complete autonomy selecting projects in his lab, his interventions are rare, and they don't happen unless the time and circumstances are right. ""Often, people ask for help and I don't have the resources or the solution,"" he says. Exceptions like Haslet-Davis and Ewing come from ""feeling deeply about it and being in the position to make it happen.""

I realize talking to Herr that it's not my story that's weak, it's the technology. I'd incorrectly understood his comment about an imminent cure. Paralysis is ""low­hanging fruit"" in that it's a condition they can impact in ten to twenty years instead of fifty. There are no toys to play with in Herr's lab closet. Not yet.

Before Herr and I wrap up our last visit, I ask what he'd do if he were at an impasse. It's clear, at least to me, that I'm talking about myself. Being a scientist, he focuses on process. He says he throws everything and anything at a problem. He visualizes each idea as a rock and starts turning them over. He mentions an acquaintance who came to see him earlier in the day who was struggling with depression. Herr started in, imagining at hyperspeed all the places the person might go and hadn't yet. ""Acupuncture? No? Meditation? No? Are you running? No? What medications have you tried? One? One! There's like 20 antidepressants! Go, go, go!"" he says he wanted to plead. He chuckles at his overexuberance, but his belief is real. This can be solved!

When I say goodbye to Herr and watch him bound down from the upper level of the restaurant to the rain-drenched sidewalk, I'm struck by a malaise. Maybe it's the rain. Maybe it's the opportunity lost. Maybe it's the way he flipped a switch on his emPower ankle and raced effortlessly into the street. But then I think about Herr turning over one rock at a time and the span of possibilities he presented to help with depression. I'm not out of options. There are hundreds of researchers working on a paralysis cure, and I immediately think of a world map I saw recently on a website with dozens of bright red circles representing centers of innovation. I can hear the words of my neurologist, who on my last visit leaned in with something else when he said goodbye. ""Keep moving,"" he urged. There's even a clinic in New Hampshire I heard about where they've produced exceptional walking recoveries using a robotic gait trainer available nowhere else in the U.S.

I begin to wonder, was Herr's story about his depressed acquaintance allegorical? An on-the-spot intervention? Had I just been, ever so lightly, smiled upon, too?"
104,104,"In 2013, the United States ceded the supercomputing crown to China, whose Sunway TaihuLight machine is over five times as powerful as the U.S. government's fastest system, called Titan. But the Department of Energy is working on a new generation of supercomputers that are 50 times faster than Titan -- a performance boost described as ""exascale."" Today, DoE awarded $258 million in contracts to six U.S. companies -- AMD, Cray (maker of Titan), Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Intel, and Nvidia -- to build an exascale system by 2021. The companies themselves are expected to add at least $172 million of their own funding to the project, since they will also benefit from the new technologies developed.

Technological contributions to the Exascale Computing Project will vary. In the first phase, companies will be designing technologies that could potentially be used in a future system, says Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). It will be pushing a new computer architecture that keeps data in monstrous amounts of superfast RAM where it can be worked on all at once, rather than shuttling it to and from slower hard drives. This pool of data will be a ""fabric"" linking processors that work on the data. HPE introduced a prototype of this technology, called The Machine last month.

That memory-oriented approach seems to jibe with IBM's philosophy. ""High performance computing is shifting from a purely compute-centric model to one that is much more data-centric,"" writes James Sexton of IBM Research in an email to Fast Company. ""The ability to manage, train, sort and analyze the data 'where it resides' and 'as it flows' through the system is critical to gaining insight quickly from the plethora of data sources vs. traditional [computing methods].""

Nvidia's contribution will be more-powerful graphics processing units for artificial intelligence -- a generation or more beyond the new Volta chips going into DoE computers already slated for 2018. Beyond the hardware, DoE is also charging the companies to write powerful software to run the monstrous calculations.

You'd be forgiven for not grasping what the performance goal of 1,000 petaflop/s (quadrillions of calculations per second) means for real-world applications. DoE lists plenty of potential examples, such as simulating the effects of earthquakes, predicting the effectiveness of cancer treatments, designing nuclear fusion reactors, and modeling the aerodynamics of giant wind farms. An April 2017 DoE presentation on phenomena that the system can model even includes the words ""climate change"" -- once in a 30-page document.

One of the Exascale Computing Project's green goals is to boost performance without requiring more energy. But even if DoE succeeds, it will still have a pretty high electric bill. The best-case scenario is a system that consumes 20 megawatts, enough to power about 20,000 homes."

Veteran motorist Jean Cunningham thought she was on to an unexpected windfall when she received an email out of the blue to tell her a refund of her car road fund tax was due.

The 68-year-old Gosport pensioner sold her 2014 Ford Fiesta to a private buyer in July, so she didn't believe anything was amiss when an email claiming to come from the Driver Vehicle Licencing Agency (DVLA) said they owed her £239.35.

But the normally online security savvy former insurance clerk turned carer was within a whisker of being scammed out of thousands of pounds until Streetwise got involved.

The criminals behind the email had taken the deception to the next level by including a link of how to report scamming inside their hoax email.

It was so sophisticated and convincing that she was persuaded to drop her guard and disclose her bank sort code and account number.

Jean explained that since she lost her husband to cancer just two years ago, a car had been her lifeline, enabling her to visit family and friends in Waterlooville and Devon.

She decided she could afford a larger more comfortable car for the longer journeys so moving up-market became essential.

'At first I explored selling my as-new low-mileage car through local Ford dealers,' she said, 'but one of my sons suggested I advertised it privately and on the internet to get the best price for it.'

'It was quickly snapped up by a buyer in Portsmouth so when his cheque cleared through the bank I was rather pleased with myself.

'There's no suggestion that the buyer had anything to do with what happened, but at the beginning of August I got the unexpected email from the DVLA telling me I was due a refund of car tax as it can't be carried over to the new owner.

'It all looked very innocuous and convincing and nobody would have believed it was an audacious copycat of the DVLA official website.'

Jean's guard was down because it included the DVLA's existing logos and typeface fonts. It was cleverly designed to dupe unsuspecting motorists into sharing their personal banking data.

She added: 'What tipped the scales and convinced me it was perfectly genuine was another link on the site warning people about online DVLA scammers and instructing them how to report it.

'The email said that they were notifying me of the outstanding tax refund, and to click on a link to a secure web claim form.'

The brazen anti-scam note said if she was suspicious any email wasn't from the DVLA then to forward it to 'phishing@dvla.gsi.gov.uk'.

It went on to urge her to complete the secure online web application which promised that the refund would appear in her RBS bank account within four to six days.

But little did Jean know that by a stroke of luck she was destined to avoid being taken to the cleaners.

She didn't complete the application until a week or so later when she got around to it. Quite by chance she mentioned it to her son Liam when he phoned her an hour or so later for a chat about the family's bank holiday plans.

He instantly smelled a rat and advised her to phone Streetwise to confirm if the website was genuine.

We advised her it was phoney and she'd been understandably taken in by a very convincing scam. We urged her to get on to the RBS 24/7 security line and report the incident to her bank immediately.

In the meantime we sent RBS an instant scam email alert to tell them Jean was about to request a block on all her accounts.

An appreciative Jean said: 'The bank immediately got on the case and although the thieves had already tried to withdraw an initial £1,500 from my current account it was countermanded in the nick of time.

'It was your prompt action that saved me from my own stupid mistake, but lady luck was definitely on my side.

'I appreciate I'd been very silly but never for one moment did I believe I was susceptible to online fraud. It only goes to show how wrong I was and how clever and convincing the rogues turned out to be.

'Had Liam not phoned when he did I've not the slightest doubt my bank balance would have taken a significant hit. I really can't thank you enough for your prompt action and advice.'

It's not the first time Streetwise had been alerted to scammers targeting readers by impersonating the DVLA.

They told us they hadn't fallen for the ruse because the emails were a dead giveaway just crudely asking to confirm their direct debit details. Streetwise referred them to the police fraud reporting website 'Action Fraud'.

In the meantime the DVLA had stepped up its warning to motorists it would never contact them about direct debits, and to resist any temptation to open attachments which were likely to contain tracking bugs designed to steal sensitive personal information from their computers.

A spokesperson said: 'The DVLA will never send links to third party sites or ask for confirmation of personal details or payment information - red flags that should warn drivers before they fall for the scam and submit their own data.'"
106,106,"Elsa Martin (Letters, 6/9) needs to get her facts right. All Australians have a democratic right not to have their children vaccinated, but are precluded from obtaining some Family Tax Benefits and enrolment in childcare centre if they cannot provide evidence of doing so or a satisfactory waiver. She says: ""If you or your children are vaccinated then why fear catching a disease from those unvaccinated: you are protected by being vaccinated. It is not logical then to worry about it, particularly when the vaccination rates are 95per cent"". However, babies do not usually start their vaccination program until they are two months old, and so are extremely vulnerable until then. Other people, due to medical issues, are unable to be vaccinated and are also vulnerable. The higher the percentage of the population that is vaccinated, the less chance these at-risk groups have of contracting one of these devastating diseases.

The importance of ensuring herd immunity

Elsa Martin, a percentage of people in the community, many of them children, cannot have live vaccines and therefore must be protected by herd immunity. My precious 2-year-old granddaughter is one of them as she is a liver transplant recipient. Yes, the vaccinated are safe, but cancer and transplant children, for example, are not.

Related Articles Cook's tour of discovery: There are many threads to our history's tapestry Living with the aftermath of diphtheria

I was raised in a town in New South Wales and in 1954 a diphtheria epidemic swept through it. All those who contracted the disease and were not vaccinated died. However, seven young people who had been vaccinated still contracted the disease. All were left with some form of permanent disability. In my case, I have suffered with major eye problems for the last 63years. To give you some idea how quickly diphtheria can take effect, at 9am I was at school with no ill effects. By 11am, I was in hospital in a coma which lasted 48hours. I remained in isolation for many days, and was in hospital for six weeks. It took many months for me to recover sufficiently to return to school. The doctors told my parents that it was not unusual for immunisation to not always provide 100per cent protection.

What if a flood were coming and everyone was required to help build a wall with sand bags? Would Elsa Martin refuse to help because she could rely on 95per cent of other people building the wall for her? Herd immunity requires everyone who can be vaccinated to do so. To do otherwise is selfish and dangerous to the rest of society.

An attack that could have been prevented

My younger daughter had a very bad attack of measles when she was just 11months old. My elder daughter had been vaccinated against it but the younger one was still too young to be vaccinated. Had the child from whom she caught the infection been vaccinated, my child would not have been so terribly sick.

It would fabulous if all in the community had the choice to be vaccinated. Unfortunately this is not the case for many, such as myself, who have received chemotherapy, as well as babies too young to be vaccinated.

THE FORUM Let's open our door

Any monetary compensation to the men on Manus Island seems ludicrous when their situation is becoming even worse, and more dangerous, as the centre is being bulldozed. Papua New Guinea does not have the social and economic capacity to provide a secure future for people who are being forced to remain - assuming that some might relocate to the United States (and there is a big question mark around this). The only safe solution is to bring them here. To make this 180degree shift will take courage and leadership, and these are sadly lacking on both sides of politics.

Learning to suck eggs

The brouhaha over the proposed Adventure Activity Standards (The Age, 4/9) reminds me of an edict issued about 25years ago to volunteer groups working in the bush. They were instructed to complete courses on the handling of chain saws and similar tools. Our Friends group, which had worked with Parks Victoria's rangers over many years on various projects, consisted of farmers, bush workers and others with long years of experience of using and maintaining their tools in the bush. They declined the invitation to ""upskill"" and there were many laughs as we were reduced to wielding pruning shears in the face of branches or trees blocking bush roads and tracks.

We have no hope of limiting global greenhouse gas emissions to 1.5per cent, or even 2per cent, unless we go on a ""war footing"". Our current trend is to 3.5per cent. In the absence of effective commonwealth action, we rely on the states to lead the way, and every political party must play a positive part. They should recognise that climate change is causing a decline in agricultural production and water flows, an alarming increase in extreme weather events, and other unwanted consequences such as a steep decline in wetland bird populations.

Cool, calming greenery

Terrifying ""leaders""

I do not know which of the dynamic duo scares me the most - Kim Jong-un or The Donald. The final scenes in the terrifying film, Dr Strangelove, remind us to be alarmed, but does anyone have a solution when our fate is in the hands of seeming mad men, surrounded by craven politicians on all sides? Is there anyone out there with the ""way to go"" that does not involve taking sides? Ban the armaments industry, I say.

Kim Jong-Un is busy rehearsing for World War III, Donald Trump's tiny fingers are hovering over the button, and Malcolm Turnbull is quibbling about pointless pieces of paper. What we really need is Australian-Martian dual citizenship.

A dangerous message

Melinda Gates' article about the benefits and dangers of social media was timely (Comment, 5/9). It coincided with news that a 13-year-old Adelaide student took her own life after what her family allege was a campaign of cyber bullying from peers.

We all have a role in raising awareness of the detrimental consequences of communication technology. I hear of young people judging their self-worth by how many likes they accumulate on their Facebook posts, and their physical appeal by comments such as ""as gorgeous as ever"". This also applies to posts of photos of adults, and ones they put up of their young children. What kind of message is this conveying to children? That being photogenic and pretty/handsome is what counts? Are parents asking themselves how their own use of social media is influencing their children's perceptions and values?

Diana Yallop, Surrey Hills

The correct priorities

Young children do not need ""device time"". Seven years ago the possibility of introducing computers into my child's kindergarten was discussed. The teacher said that every moment children were on electronic devices was time lost in their social development. This is still relevant today. No child will be left behind if they don't have an electronic device in kindergarten.

Circumventing rules

Confiscating mobile phones from people who use them while driving (Letters, 6/9) will not work. When it was tried at my children's school, students just carried dummy phones to hand to the teachers.

Show us you care, MPs

A test of resilience, ethics and empathy is a great idea - but why limit it to future teachers? How about MPs and bank executives, for a start?

Miranda Jones, Drummond

And show leadership

Two instances of pollie speak: the Coalition's Christopher Pyne in The House (ABC TV) explaining the theatricality of Question Time, which seemed to allow for point scoring rather than giving information. Then Labor's Tony Burke telling an enquiry into rowdy behaviour that any sanctions should not undermine the ""uniquely Australian"" character of parliament, which was ""passionate, serious, fearless and robust"". While our MPs admire themselves and their behaviour, they have lost touch with people who want them to lead - to come together and find solutions to the problems we face.

Philip Gardner, Montmorency

Trust them? No way

Ross Gittins believes business people have an ""overblown sense of entitlement"" and that governments will soon do something to fix that. May I suggest he is wrong. The people with the really overweening sense of entitlement are the politicians. They imagine themselves to be not our ""representatives"", but our ""leaders"". And, increasingly, they are working hand-in-glove with the business people that Gittins condemns, so that they may retire from politics to pick up their million-dollar per year consultancies, directorships or informal kickbacks.

Stephen Morris, Coorparoo, Qld

Walk in their shoes

Congratulations to Miki Perkins for her excellent article (""Striking childcare staff deserve support"", 6/9). Perhaps Senator David Leyonhjelm, who believes that child care workers only ""wipe noses and stop kids from killing each other"", would like to spend a day in one of their centres. He would then be free to demonstrate to us all how easy it must be to control a class of, say, 25 preschoolers for a day. My guess is this arrogant and ignorant individual would be crying for mercy within an hour.

So much fuss for a strip

I have been a diabetic for about 27years. In order to keep check on my blood sugar, we use a machine that uses blood glucose test strips. I have never had any problems obtaining these from Diabetes Victoria in the earlier days or our pharmacy over the last few years. I have now been advised that I will have to complete a form every half year in order to obtain my strips.

It seems this government has created a new administration, printed millions of forms and wants patients to go to their doctor twice a year to have these signed. As more than 1 million people have diabetes, the cost of those shenanigans must be enormous. If people forget to organise all this in time to get a new supply of the test strips, they may well end up in hospital. May I remind the government that, without the strips, our machines are useless.

Ben van Heusden, Coolaroo

Uneven writing field

It was good to read about the Miles Franklin and Stella prizes in Jason Steger's article (The Age, 6/9). However, the Stella prize was not only started because of two years of all-male short lists. It was also because of decades of discrimination against women writers.

Only one in four Miles Franklin prizes have been won by women since its inception in 1957. Other awards show similar patterns, with men awarded prizes around two to three times as often as women. Also, some newspapers and literary journals review roughly twice as many books by men as those by women, despite the fact that their published works are roughly equal in quantity and quality.

This means that these authors are less often brought to the notice of readers, particularly those who might buy or recommend their work, place it on school and university reading lists, or nominate it for prizes. Fortunately, the Stella prize and its work analysing gender bias in book reviewing are helping to gradually turn things around.

So it was in May 2015, that a trio of researchers at the University of NSW stumbled across the idea of making more room on a silicon atom to squeeze in quantum computer bits - known as qubits - by pulling electrons away from the nucleus.

Quantum computers can solve problems normal computers cannot, and UNSW engineers have found a way to make them cheaper. Vision: UNSW.

In a paper published in the journal Nature Communications on Wednesday, the scientists led by Guilherme Tosi​ unveil the theoretical potential of this novel approach. They predict it will remove a hurdle that threatened to stall progress on scaling up the number of qubits on silicon chips needed to make quantum computing viable.

Unlike the discrete zeros and ones now used in so-called ""classical"" computing, qubits can be either a one, a zero or both at the same time, opening the way for an exponential increase in computing speeds using these ""superpositions"". Many problems now limited by computing power, from medicine to climate modelling, would be more easily solved with quantum computing.

Another property of quantum objects is that they operate in a type of pairing known as entanglement. However, this property - whereby switching one instantly switches its pair - appeared to be limited for silicon qubits, requiring them to be only 10-20 nanometres or just 50 atoms apart.

""If they're too close, or too far apart, the 'entanglement' between quantum bits - which is what makes quantum computers so special - doesn't occur,"" Dr Tosi said. ""This new idea allows us to fabricate multi-qubit processes with current technology.""

Andrea Morello, program manager of the UNSW-based ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, said the concept of pulling electrons from the nucleus builds on concepts raised by an earlier UNSW scientists Bruce Kane in a landmark 1998 Nature paper - just nobody had seen it.

""I looked at that paper for 15 years,"" Dr Morello said. ""It was basically already there but nobody saw it.""

Dr Morello recalls running to his computer to make early calculations before his colleagues Dr Tosi and Fahd Mohiyaddin - another of the paper's authors - worked to confirm the potential.

The results is what the team dubs a ""flip-flop"" qubit. The new type is defined as in ""zero"" state when the electron spin is up, while a ""1"" state is when the electron spin is up, and the nuclear spin is down.

By tugging the electron from the nucleus, the qubit can be controlled by electric signals rather than magnetic ones because an electrical difference - or dipole - is created in the process.

""These electric dipoles interact with each other over fairly large distances, a good fraction of a micron, or 1000 nanometres,"" Dr Morello said, or far more than the 10-20 nanometre limit of a more standard approach.

The scientists said that although the paper was theoretical, the UNSW team had already begun to make devices based on the approach with ""impressive results"" that will be submitted in future papers.

""It really allows us to scale up to multi-qubit architectures now,"" Dr Tosi said.

One advantage of using single-atom silicon was that it was very similar to what existing large-scale chip-making foundaries do, he said.

David Reilly, a physicist who heads Sydney University's rival Quantum Nanoscience Laboratory, said the field of quantum computing was evolving and the UNSW-led research was an example of identifying an issue and how the industry might solve it.

""The challenge is to test those ideas and to carry out experiments that will take many years,"" Professor Reilly said.

He noted the paper outlined how the silicon-based quantum approach may be married to the superconductor path favoured by industry giants.

""The super conducting system that's being pursued by IBM and Google, for instance, is quite far ahead of the silicon effort,"" Professor Reilly said.

That effort ""is still at a phase where science is happening, new approaches are being proposed, problems are surfacing and they're coming up with clever approaches to get around them"", he said."
108,108,"After disasters in the United States like Hurricane Harvey, lawyers get busy with lawsuits seeking to apportion blame and claim damages. This time, a new kind of litigation is likely to appear, they say - relating to climate change.

That's because rapid scientific advances are making it possible to precisely measure what portion of a disaster such as Harvey can be attributed to the planet's changing climate.

Such evidence could well feed negligence claims as some victims of the hurricane may seek to fault authorities or companies for failing to plan for such events, according to several lawyers interviewed by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""As extreme weather events and related damages and other impacts increase in severity ... courts will increasingly be called upon to seek redress for damages suffered,"" said Lindene Patton, a risk-management lawyer with the Earth & Water Group, a Washington-based specialty law firm.

Hurricane Harvey last week brought unprecedented destruction as incessant rain and winds of up to 130 miles per hour caused catastrophic damage, making large swathes of Texas and Louisiana uninhabitable for weeks or months.

Images of soldiers and police in helicopters and special high-water trucks rescuing Texans stranded by floodwater brought back painful memories of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana a decade ago.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rejected a contention by scientists and the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organisation that the historic rainfall from Harvey was linked to climate change.

Still, the dramatic scenes rekindled questions about the extent to which climate change can be blamed for such a monster hurricane, beyond broad predictions that global warming will increase the frequency of freak weather events.

This time around, scientists are increasingly confident they can come up with answers. Their tool is a new science, known as event attribution, which determines what proportion of a specific extreme weather event can be blamed on climate change. It has been making fast progress over the last five years in part due to dramatic advances in computing power, said Daniel Horton, a climate scientist at Northwestern University in Illinois who has worked on climate change attribution studies.

""The development of event attribution is a big deal,"" he said in a phone interview. Last year, scientists from organisations around the world working with World Weather Attribution (WWA), a programme coordinated by U.S.-based research and journalism organisation Climate Central, established that torrential rain that had flooded Louisiana in the summer had been made about twice as likely due to man-made climate change. Now, a group of scientists at Oxford University in England say they plan to measure how much of Hurricane Harvey's intensity bears the fingerprints of climate change. Their climate modelling project, climateprediction.net, is a partner of the WWA program.

""There is such a high interest in Harvey,"" said Friederike Otto, the lead scientist at Oxford for WWA. The process involves a network of computers performing thousands of possible weather scenario runs after data from sea surface to atmospheric concentration of planet-warming greenhouse gases has been entered in a model, she said by phone.

If other WWA partners prioritise the project in their own laboratories, it could take between a few months to a year to reach a conclusion, said Otto, who is also the deputy director of Oxford's Environmental Change Institute.

The prospect of attributing portions of extreme weather events to climate change has lawyers suggesting that a new kind of litigation is emerging. For Patton, the level of certainty reached in attribution analyses means extreme weather victims will increasingly be able to seek compensation on grounds that damages they sustained were foreseeable.

""Attribution science can inform that legal process,"" she said. In the case of Harvey, possible lawsuits could target government agencies, companies managing infrastructure or architects and engineers who have been involved in building damaged infrastructure, from sewage-treatment plants to levees. People whose new housing development is flooded - as many have been in Houston's metropolitan area - may, for instance, seek damages from municipal planners, she said.

Houston's explosive growth into a sprawling metropolis - now the fourth largest in the country - is widely attributed to the city's relaxed zoning that has made housing particularly affordable. But in the process, between 1992 and 2010, some 25,000 acres (100 square km) of wetlands that act as natural flood barriers by soaking up rainfall have been paved over or otherwise covered, according to a 2015 study by Texas A&M University. ""There could be an inquiry into whether public officials appropriately managed land use and development in a way that met their duty to their constituents,"" Patton said.

In that scenario, attribution science findings could serve to answer the question, ""What would have happened if you ... hadn't covered over those wetlands,"" she said.

Insurance companies may also seek to determine if government bodies that neglected to make flooded office buildings or strip malls resilient to climate change, for instance, should be on the hook for payouts, said Patton.

Other lawsuits could centre around explosions at a Houston-area chemical plant after floodwaters cut electricity feeding refrigeration units needed to keep tanks of volatile organic peroxide from combusting. The fires led to calls for tougher oversight even as the administration of President Donald Trump seeks to roll back regulation.

""There could be an inquiry that says 'Should there have been something done to upgrade the facility to be more resilient to extreme weather events?'"" using attribution science, Patton said.

Ultimately, such court cases could pin some responsibility for worsening extreme weather events on to the emitters of climate-warming greenhouse gases, said Joanne Zimolzak, a partner at global law firm Dentons.

The Washington-based lawyer drew a parallel with lawsuits against big tobacco companies in the 1990s. The cases ended in multibillion-dollar settlements by the tobacco industry as a consensus built around the scientific finding that an increased likelihood of lung cancer could be attributed to smoking.

""That was a linchpin in actually holding these companies responsible,"" Zimolzak said in a phone interview. ""(Scientists) are now able, because of the advances in the science, to say that climate change made the impact of an extreme weather event much greater. And so from there you can then look at who is responsible.""

At Columbia University, Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said that current lack of consensus over the accuracy of attribution science could, however, prove a hurdle in courts for now. ""But in a year or two year or three years ... it's quite possible that the science will get there."" - Thomson Reuters Foundation

Elon Musk is a genius -- a whirling dervish of intense mental and real-world activity who, apparently, can't stop worrying about AI.

And now he's got all of us worrying about artificial intelligence triggering World War III.

Is Musk wrong? My gut says: Yes, very wrong. Computers are smart and more rational than humans, so I think a sentient AI would do everything in its power to prevent a war. To be fair. Musk's comments, which were triggered by a global AI supremacy statement made by Russian President Vladimir Putin, were more of a feint at AI's possible role in the next, big global war.

It's the ""competition for AI superiority"" that could lead to World War III.

Musk offered the dark commentary after The Verge posted a story on Putin's comments before 16,000 school children on the country's Knowledge Day, the official start of the Russian school year.

Putin, did not mention war, but he made it clear that he's been thinking about AI and its role in the future of geopolitical relations:

""Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind. It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world,"" said Putin.

Some have taken the use of the word ""ruler"" literally and think that Putin was preemptively drawing battle lines: The subtext might have been: Win at this game and rule the world or be under Russia's thumb.

I think that's how Musk took it.

What's frustrating is that Musk is in many, many ways so right about AI.

However, Putin followed with a less provocative tone, reminding students, ""If we become leaders in this area, we will share this know-how with entire world, the same way we share our nuclear technologies today.""

After I read that sentence, I went back and reread the original line and though that maybe Putin was talking about ""rule"" as in ""master,"" a term students might interpret as opportunity. He was, after all, trying to inspire students to focus their studies on what might have the greatest impact on the future, and he's right to identify AI.

Musk, on the other hand, is stuck on the same note. He rarely mentions AI in person or on Twitter without trying to instill fear.

It's often tied to a cool and slightly scary idea: Neural Lace, Musk's plan to embed computer technology inside of us, or, as he described in 2016: ""Effectively merge in a symbiotic way with a digital intelligence."" Doing so would help us out think the AI robots surely coming to control or kill us. His plan may have inspired Facebook's slightly terrifying ""Brain interface.""

What's frustrating is that Musk is in many, many ways so right about AI. He sees its potential and the anticipated exponential growth rate of Artificial Intelligence. He also sells AI. All the self-driving technology in his Tesla all-electric cars have AI and future Teslas could us AI to teach themselves to drive.

Musk has also been a driving force behind the creation of valuable organizations like OpenAI, which seeks to find a path to ""safe"" AI development.

This is a someone who gets it and, I believe, is excited by the opportunities afforded by AI.

And yet he's clearly tormented by it, as well, which, I think, can blind him to some fundamental realities.

On September 4, North Korea reportedly tested a hydrogen bomb and claimed that it could put it on a warhead. People, quite reasonably, freaked out. President Donald Trump has responded with strong language and thinly veiled threats.

It feels like we're on the brink of real war.

Which is one reason why I don't think Musk's comments were very responsible. AI as a WWIII-inducing threat is, for now, theoretical. North Korea's actions are real and are calling for some kind of real response.

It's true: That response will probably be more sanctions, but tearing down AI and claiming it could have a hand in war at the precise moment we might need some smart AI algorithms to help us run scenarios that can help us all figure a way out of this, seems wrong.

Can't we build and celebrate AI before running away in terror?

Now is not the time for Musk to ratchet up his fear-mongering AI rhetoric. I welcome and agree with every bit of his oversight inclinations, but please can't we build and celebrate AI before running away in terror? Musk is not alone in his AI doomsday predictions. He's regularly joined by Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking. But it's Musk who bangs the caution drum most persistently. Eventually people could come to fear the growth of AI so much that they demand legislation to stop it cold. It could become as toxic as nuclear energy is in some parts of the world.

I know that is not Musk's goal. Still, Musk, and maybe to a certain extent Putin, made people think of AI as it might be connected to weapons, even weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).

It's true, the Defense Department has been trying to build robot warriors for decades. What we've got, though, are mostly walking or running grunt bots, and robots that can go in a defuse bombs. There aren't robot soldiers per se.

And the U.S. nuclear arsenal isn't even connected to a network.

Concerns about AI as an overt threat have always been overblown. Like robotics, it will, for years, if not decades to come, have a slow, subtle and insidious impact on our lives.

AI is not the robot coming to kill you or the weapon targeted at your home state. It's the algorithm-driven chatbot that talks to you online, helps recommend your next Netflix binge, seeks out your next Match.com date, or selects an on-the-nose ad to appear on this web page. It's the program that makes planting decisions for farmers or ferrets out the possible cancer diagnosis in a patient before a human doctor could. It's the image-recognition software picking out dogs, cats and people on Facebook images and the voice assistant with all the answers. It's the program beating you at Go, chess and poker.

AI will beat us at a thousand small games and tasks before it launches World War III.

Musk and Putin are right. There are few technologies more important to the future of the modern world than AI. We should train in it, learn it, master it and stop running away from it."

Last year, scientists from organizations around the world working with World Weather Attribution (WWA), a program coordinated by U.S.-based research and journalism organization Climate Central, established that torrential rain that had flooded Louisiana in the summer had been made about twice as likely due to man-made climate change.

Now, a group of scientists at Oxford University in England say they plan to measure how much of Hurricane Harvey's intensity bears the fingerprints of climate change. Their climate modeling project, climateprediction.net, is a partner of the WWA program.

""There is such a high interest in Harvey,"" said Friederike Otto, the lead scientist at Oxford for WWA.

The process involves a network of computers performing thousands of possible weather scenario runs after data from sea surface to atmospheric concentration of planet-warming greenhouse gases has been entered in a model, she said by phone.

If other WWA partners prioritize the project in their own laboratories, it could take between a few months to a year to reach a conclusion, said Otto, who is also the deputy director of Oxford's Environmental Change Institute.

The prospect of attributing portions of extreme weather events to climate change has lawyers suggesting that a new kind of litigation is emerging.

For Patton, the level of certainty reached in attribution analyses means extreme weather victims will increasingly be able to seek compensation on grounds that damages they sustained were foreseeable.

""Attribution science can inform that legal process,"" she said.

In the case of Harvey, possible lawsuits could target government agencies, companies managing infrastructure or architects and engineers who have been involved in building damaged infrastructure, from sewage-treatment plants to levees.

People whose new housing development is flooded - as many have been in Houston's metropolitan area - may, for instance, seek damages from municipal planners, she said.

Houston's explosive growth into a sprawling metropolis - now the fourth largest in the country - is widely attributed to the city's relaxed zoning that has made housing particularly affordable.

But in the process, between 1992 and 2010, some 25,000 acres (100 square km) of wetlands that act as natural flood barriers by soaking up rainfall have been paved over or otherwise covered, according to a 2015 study by Texas A&M University.

""There could be an inquiry into whether public officials appropriately managed land use and development in a way that met their duty to their constituents,"" Patton said.

In that scenario, attribution science findings could serve to answer the question, ""What would have happened if you ... hadn't covered over those wetlands,"" she said.

Insurance companies may also seek to determine if government bodies that neglected to make flooded office buildings or strip malls resilient to climate change, for instance, should be on the hook for payouts, said Patton.

Other lawsuits could center around explosions at a Houston-area chemical plant after floodwaters cut electricity feeding refrigeration units needed to keep tanks of volatile organic peroxide from combusting.

The fires led to calls for tougher oversight even as the administration of President Donald Trump seeks to roll back regulation.

""There could be an inquiry that says 'Should there have been something done to upgrade the facility to be more resilient to extreme weather events?'"" using attribution science, Patton told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Ultimately, such court cases could pin some responsibility for worsening extreme weather events on to the emitters of climate-warming greenhouse gases, said Joanne Zimolzak, a partner at global law firm Dentons.

The Washington-based lawyer drew a parallel with lawsuits against big tobacco companies in the 1990s. The cases ended in multibillion-dollar settlements by the tobacco industry as a consensus built around the scientific finding that an increased likelihood of lung cancer could be attributed to smoking.

""That was a linchpin in actually holding these companies responsible,"" Zimolzak said in a phone interview.

""(Scientists) are now able, because of the advances in the science, to say that climate change made the impact of an extreme weather event much greater. And so from there you can then look at who is responsible.""

At Columbia University, Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said that current lack of consensus over the accuracy of attribution science could, however, prove a hurdle in courts for now.

""But in a year or two year or three years ... it's quite possible that the science will get there.""

NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - After disasters in the United States like Hurricane Harvey, lawyers get busy with lawsuits seeking to apportion blame and claim damages. This time, a new kind of litigation is likely to appear, they say - relating to climate change.

That's because rapid scientific advances are making it possible to precisely measure what portion of a disaster such as Harvey can be attributed to the planet's changing climate.

Such evidence could well feed negligence claims as some victims of the hurricane may seek to fault authorities or companies for failing to plan for such events, according to several lawyers interviewed by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""As extreme weather events and related damages and other impacts increase in severity ... courts will increasingly be called upon to seek redress for damages suffered,"" said Lindene Patton, a risk-management lawyer with the Earth & Water Group, a Washington-based specialty law firm.

A 'BIG DEAL'

Hurricane Harvey last week brought unprecedented destruction as incessant rain and winds of up to 130 miles per hour caused catastrophic damage, making large swathes of Texas and Louisiana uninhabitable for weeks or months.

Images of soldiers and police in helicopters and special high-water trucks rescuing Texans stranded by floodwater brought back painful memories of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana a decade ago.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rejected a contention by scientists and the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization that the historic rainfall from Harvey was linked to climate change.

Still, the dramatic scenes rekindled questions about the extent to which climate change can be blamed for such a monster hurricane, beyond broad predictions that global warming will increase the frequency of freak weather events.

This time around, scientists are increasingly confident they can come up with answers.

Their tool is a new science, known as event attribution, which determines what proportion of a specific extreme weather event can be blamed on climate change.

It has been making fast progress over the last five years in part due to dramatic advances in computing power, said Daniel Horton, a climate scientist at Northwestern University in Illinois who has worked on climate change attribution studies.

114,114,"Research scientist Janelle Shane trained a neural network to make up fake diseases.

Scary-sounding, futuristic diseases are a time-honored trope of science fiction. But if you're short on ideas, a friendly neural network can help you invent a condition that's adequately unnerving -- as long as you give it enough time to learn what sounds disease-y.

Janelle Shane, a research scientist and blogger, recently worked with one of her readers to train a neural network to come up with fake ailments. First, her reader Kate Leroux, a cartographer, scraped 3,765 common names for conditions from an online medical database. Then, Shane fed those into an open-source machine-learning algorithm. The names the algorithm first generated weren't very realistic-sounding:

But after a few rounds of training, the algorithm started to get smarter, and learned the difference between disease names, body parts, and symptoms. Eventually, it came up with some pretty convincing, sci-fi-sounding conditions:

It also had a bit of a predilection for reproductive health conditions, and concocted diseases like ""penis arthritis,"" ""vaginal diffection,"" and ""orgy fever."" (Shane sent these particular examples to me via email.)

As often happens with neural networks, the project wasn't a slam dunk. I don't think the writers of the new Star Trek series need to be worried about their jobs. But there's something earnestly delightful about tasking computers with creative tasks like this. Machines, even learning machines, approach them in such a different way than a human would, and it's sweet when a computer says ""like this? Did I do good?""

Sure, computer. Let's pretend Cancer of the Cancer is a thing."

They enjoy football games, concerts and family bike rides on trails around the Rome area.

QUESTION: In no more than 200 words, please describe the state of Rome City Schools.

SEIFERT: ""The RCS system is at a serious crossroads. There has been a lack of central leadership and adequate communication between the board, educators and parents. We must embrace the challenge of preparing our students to be successful in the new global economy. Our schools are known for excellent academics, as shown by the volume of AP scholars every year, but we must keep growing to remain relevant and on par with the jobs and careers out there waiting on our students. Our teachers are our biggest asset and have the ability to provide educational opportunities for each and every student regardless of background; teachers need the proper assets to be successful. I am a first-generation college student. (I watched, and cried, as my dad graduated from Kennesaw State at age 60.) We must meet these challenges not only for our kids' futures but for our own. We need to harness the energy of our students, utilize the wealth of knowledge and experience of our amazing teachers, and make every student believe that he or she can succeed in a big way in this world and the future to come.""

DIXON: ""The state of the Rome City Schools system is a constantly changing, ever improving system. This ensures the needs of the students will be met as they prepare to join the workforce or continue their education at a college or technical school. Changes take place in every aspect of our lives, some are planned and others are unplanned. Our school system is continuously changing to prepare the students to successfully meet the requirements needed to meet the demands they will be facing. The school board is always looking ahead, planning for the future so our students will be prepared to be successful in our ever-changing world.""

COLLINS: ""The state of Rome City Schools has shown outstanding rankings statewide in: our school climate rating, Advanced Placement Scholars, AP Stem Scholars, Spirit of Green Award, leader in athletics by winning the GHSA state football championship, winning awards in the arts for middle school band and high school band, jazz band, and concert band programs, as well as choral program. In addition, Rome City Schools has been named one of the Top Ten Digital School districts in GA and students from the nontraditional Phoenix Performance Learning Center (PLC) received the Georgia School Boards Association (GSBA) first place award in video contest. Rome City Schools has a commitment to maintaining high-standards for all students. Our school system displays continuous growth in the high school graduation rate, expanding the use of technology to increase student achievement.""

FISHER: ""I believe Rome City Schools are excellent schools, not necessarily because of the resources we have, but because of the quality of teachers and staff. I have enjoyed volunteering with RCS because I am impressed with its employees and the positive environment they create for our students. Great things are happening at the elementary, middle and high school levels. Rome High has 84 AP Scholars and a recent 92.8% graduation rate. Elm Street and North Heights are STEM certified schools. Rome Wolves won the 5A State Football Championship last year. There is just not enough space to list everything! I fully support the One Rome vision. We should work together to bring our students the best education possible and it absolutely starts at the beginning with kindergarten. I think Dr. Holland's commitment to not just Rome High but to all students and the community is energizing. I believe there is some room for improvement. Our schools need more resources and classroom space to keep instep with growing demands. I think RCS could also be better partners with community resources. We all want what is best for our students and we are stronger when we work together and communicate needs.""

EHRLER: ""Although we have serious problems to solve, I want to see Rome City Schools in the news more for the great things that are happening. And, there are definitely some great things going on in Rome City Schools. Just to name a few, State Superintendent Richard Woods recently visited North Heights Elementary to recognize the school for their STEM certification. He then visited Elm Street Elementary, also a STEM certified school, as one of only five winners of the Georgia Family-Friendly Partnership School (FFPS) Award. Since 2012, Rome High's graduation rates have topped the state average by some 9 to 15 percentage points. There is excitement in the air on fall Friday nights at Barron Stadium. We have areas for improvement as well. There are achievement gaps across groups of kids and our discipline issues are higher than they should be. Our teachers have insufficient resources and their time is overtaxed outside of the classroom. Our bus transportation problems definitely need to be tackled sooner rather than later. As a new school board member, I will ensure that these issues will be a focus during my term.""

QUESTION: An independent college and career academy based at Rome High, a field house and other athletics improvements, the Main/North Heights projects and the county schools projects: How will you vote on Nov. 7 on the latest extension of the 1-cent education tax and why?

SEIFERT: ""After research and consulting with Rome/Floyd Citizens for Better Schools, I still have questions. Extending the current ELOST is an excellent opportunity to benefit our schools, with potential game-changers as far as projects. However, there is still work to be done and questions to be answered. This proposal provides our community with an opportunity to participate in some collaborative leadership where both City and County can have a voice and all our students benefit. My kids are a year apart, and I just spent two consecutive years with sixth graders at West End. The idea of a sixth grade academy is appealing to me but I do have questions regarding logistics. Also, the second-tier projects aren't as flashy or exciting but are very much needed. For example, one project is equipping all the elementary school gyms with air-conditioning. I've spent the last eight years sweating through PTO programs and school dances in the West End Gym, so this highly appealing to me. My point is: Don't throw the baby out with the bath water...if you aren't 100% on board with one proposal project. ELOST can, with some work, benefit all our students in all our schools.""

DIXON: ""I will vote YES. Our school systems (both city and county) need the money to make improvements in existing school buildings and to build new schools. As a result of state funds being constantly cut and citizens being taxed beyond their means, our school systems need this money to improve existing facilities and to build needed new facilities.""

COLLINS: ""I will vote for the extension of the 1-cent education tax because of my concern about meeting the needs of all students. As an innovative thinker, I can envision the future of our school system. We cannot lose sight of totally focusing on the best for our students. The division of buildings at the previous Main Elementary School site and the open campus had always been a security concern. It is definitely time to make absolutely sure that our faculty and students are placed in a safe/secure school environment. The new Main Elementary School will provide an opportunity for the education of Main Elementary students in Pre-K to 5th grades to be safely under one roof in one location. The changing of North Heights to a STEM Academy serving all of Rome City 6th grade students will further promote a strong STEM education to develop ideas and make discoveries through instruction in STEM programs. The College and Career Academy based at Rome High will be a showcase for education and workforce development. It will serve all students with a seamless transition to post-secondary opportunities. The multipurpose building which will house the athletic department will be used for many activities.""

FISHER: ""I will be voting yes for ELOST on Nov. 7. I recently toured RHS during the school day while it was in full operation and the school, while pristine, is over 25 years old. There is simply not enough space for their needs. RHS has over 200 additional students this year than last. If we don't have plans to address this, what will our school be like in five years? There is no question that RHS athletic facilities are cramped and inadequate. A field house and athletic improvements would benefit all of our athletes. The plan to merge all 6th graders and create the 6th Grade STEAM Academy would have incredible benefits for not only 6th grade students, but also for the students at the elementary schools because it frees up more classroom space. It's about time...our elementary students need air conditioning in the gymnasiums. They are returning to school in July and it is unreasonable to expect them to thrive in such hot conditions. The county school projects are exciting too. Pepperell Middle and Armuchee need these improvements. I completely support investing in our city and county schools and I believe ELOST is important to pass in November.""

EHRLER: ""I will be voting for the extension of the 1-cent education tax (ELOST). Rome is in the beginning phase of growth, both in terms of student population and need for diversity in the curricula at our schools. This year alone, Rome City Schools has had a significant increase in student enrollment. We need more room. We need to move 6th grade out of the elementary schools. The statistics are also very clear that, while traditional college is the dream of many, technical tracks have employment and income potentials that can equal or exceed the potential for some jobs requiring a traditional college degree. Rome has a need for technical specialists. We have a need for the ELOST to pass in order for our schools to grow in the way they need to grow.""

QUESTION: We've seen three superintendents in four years, three principals at Rome High in that same period and sweeping departures in Rome High athletics with rumblings of teacher turnover next. How would you help stabilize and improve the administration of Rome City Schools?

SEIFERT: ""I've noted, as a parent, some divisiveness in our community...a sense of 'us' vs. 'them'. There is a lack of transparency and appears to be little consistent central leadership. We need delegation and involvement of those who are actually 'in the know' - that is, the teachers and the parents. I want to bring transparency and accountability to the Board when it comes to communication and giving the community a voice. The Board's meetings and agenda items should be published in advance for the public and for parents and teachers who have a vested interest and want to make their voice heard. Stabilization is achieved by communication, and centralized, accurate, and congruent communication has been lacking. I initially decided to run for the Board because, despite my attendance at monthly board meetings, I rarely know the agenda items in advance and have never been offered an opportunity to weigh in as a parent on any issue. Parents and educators should have a seat at the table and a voice before the Board. I have the leadership experience to move this school system forward with stability, teamwork, and spirit.""

DIXON: ""Educators leave positions in a school system for a variety of reasons. The superintendent and school administrators are best suited to encourage retention and to select the most qualified candidates to fill vacancies. The school board should set long term goals to meet the needs of students. They should work with the superintendent and school administrators as necessary to accomplish those goals.""

COLLINS: ""The stabilization of the administration is a cooperative effort beginning with collaboration with the Board of Education and the Superintendent. It is the intent of the Board to work for the best for students in everything we do. As a consensus builder, I believe I can help guide our Board to reach common ground on issues of concern. We must focus on recruitment and retaining highly qualified and capable staff. We must build communication and understanding with employees, parents, and stakeholders.""

FISHER: ""Three superintendents in four years and three principals at RHS is a lot of change. Of course, retirement was a catalyst for some of the changes. Anna K Davie, Rome Middle, and Rome High School each have new principals this year and I support their visions for our students. Going forward, a school board member's role is to hold the superintendent accountable for the quality of the leadership and our school system. The school board is designed as a check and balance for the school system and it also sets policy. As a school board member, my goal is to uphold the high-standards that Rome expects from its schools and do what is best for all of our students, staff, and community. The school board is also responsible for budget oversight. RCS must be responsible financial stewards of your tax dollars. My background as a chemical engineer provides unique experience in evaluating and optimizing the financial relationship between the school system and community members. As a parent with three in each level in the school system, I definitely have a finger on the pulse of our school system. I am personally invested in Rome City Schools and its success.""

EHRLER: You can't hide dysfunction in a school system. While energy and motivation is contagious among educators, so is the opposite. Typically, the main leadership problems that contribute to the loss of top teachers is breach of trust, lack of consistency, ineffective communication, lack of vision, or all of those factors combined. Building the trust with our teachers and the community is a long process, and we cannot move forward without it. As a new school board member, it will be my commitment to ensure that the only issue on the table will be the well-being and education of our children. Secondly, building trust requires greater transparency in communication. This means more public discussion of issues than what we have seen before. Thirdly, it will be my commitment to ensure that our system's leadership maintains integrity and competence at the highest level, conducts business fairly and consistently and communicates with teachers and the community with a clear and positive vision.""

QUESTION: Technology has surged to a point where it needs to be branded with the traditional 3 Rs. Where do you see Rome City Schools in terms of technological achievements by 2021, the year you would stand for re-election?

SEIFERT: ""My kids have been the beneficiaries of many of the technological advances our schools have made over the past several years including Chromebooks on a 1:1 ratio, SmartBoards in classrooms, utilization of online cloud-based learning modules, and several others. We need to keep moving forward in order to best prepare each of our students for success in the global technology-based economy. The best advisors in this area would be our teachers, as they know how students can best thrive in the classroom with constantly changing technology. Having cutting edge technology is great, but only if our teachers are given input as well as the resources and instruction necessary for maximizing its effectiveness. I suggest forming an advisory committee led by educators to make recommendations for specific needs that, if met, will facilitate the best classroom experience. Our teachers (our greatest asset) are our 'boots on the ground', being in the classroom every day, meeting educational challenges head on. In 2021, I will have a junior and a senior at Rome High, and I expect them to be technologically prepared for whatever future they choose in the every-advancing global economy.""

DIXON: ""Computers will be the key component of classroom teaching in coming years. We must plan to utilize technology to the maximum in making certain every student is able to read, write and compute at their grade level as they progress through the system from kindergarten to graduation.""

COLLINS: ""In terms of technological achievements in the traditional 3 Rs, as we look toward our 2020 vision, we can observe all students developing critical, creative thinking and problem solving skills, and the continued increase in technology at all grade levels. I see greater productivity and leaps in educational achievements through STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) certification and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) certification is being incorporated into classrooms throughout our school system.""

FISHER: ""Technology is constantly advancing, and it is a challenge to stay current. As it is incorporated more into the school curriculum, technology is allowing students to learn in independent and creative ways. Our curriculums are changing as well, as we concentrate on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) methodology that will better prepare our students. ELOST, if passed, would build a 6th Grade STEAM Academy at North Heights and it would be a state-of-the-art facility. I believe this would be a tremendous achievement for Rome City Schools. ELOST would also make a 1:1 Chromebook to student ratio beginning in 2nd grade. Our students are expected to take Georgia Milestones tests online in 3rd grade. Technology will not replace the personal instruction teachers provide, but it certainly enhances the tools teachers have available. By 2021, I see a strong school board that understands graduation is not an endpoint, but rather a milestone for all students. Our students need to be prepared to tackle evolving technology in order to compete for top spots in secondary education and employment after graduation. The Rome City School system must stay committed to providing and expanding opportunities for career exploration before graduation.""

EHRLER: ""Why is instructional technology so important? Because today, students no longer learn 7 hours a day. They collaborate with peers, create and share ideas and research 24 hours a day through phones, tablets and laptops. Like it or not, students learn best through technology. Rome City Schools has an incredibly competent technology department that readily and successfully adapts to, and evolved with, the ever-changing digital landscape. Several of our schools have initiated STEM programs as fantastic starting points for incorporating technology concepts with instruction. But, our schools are truly in need of better instructional resources that fully take advantage of the technology we have. As a school board member, I will ensure that our yearly goals will include greater emphasis on bringing instruction and technology together through initiatives like the STEM program and the development of partnerships with technology leaders. It is also time for Rome City Schools to merge our technology and teaching resources into a combined EdTech department in order to serve as a comprehensive resource to better enhance teaching and learning.""

QUESTION: The most important thing to happen to Rome City Schools in the next four years will be what?

SEIFERT: ""Progress. We can achieve progress through increased participation of parents, educators and the community. Progress must be achieved through transparency and accountability. Most importantly, progress is essential in preparing Rome City School students to be successful in higher education and in the ever-changing global job market.""

DIXON: ""The most important thing to happen in the next four years is to ensure that our teachers have all the skills and equipment needed to educate our students in order for them to be successful in our ever-changing world.""

COLLINS: ""The most important thing to happen in Rome City Schools in the next four years will include my top priority to help guide the academic success of all students. We must never forget that learning is a continuous process!""

FISHER: ""The most important thing to happen to Rome City Schools cannot be one thing. It is all of the details that work together that make our schools exceptional. We must anticipate classroom demands and plan accordingly. We must integrate technology into curriculum and remain current so our students are competitive for secondary education or work after graduation. We must provide our teachers and students with the tools they need to accomplish curriculum demands. We must provide a comfortable environment for all, even those in the gymnasium. We must partner with our community members because they serve city school students. We must feed our students nutritious and tasteful meals and snacks, because a hungry band student does not have a great practice. We must provide safe transportation. We must maintain our buildings. There are too many factors that work together and when they are out of balance, our whole school system suffers. Academics must always be the first priority, with athletics and arts following its lead, but all three are vital components for our students. We must provide all students with a well-rounded experience from kindergarten to graduation and there is no one thing that will accomplish that.""

EHRLER: ""The community's continued support for our children's education is by far the most important thing that needs to happen for Rome City Schools over the next four years. As a community, we need to pass the ELOST on November 7th. Our schools simply cannot grow in the way we need them to grow without it.""

COMING WEDNESDAY: The next five candidates on the Nov. 7 ballot for Rome's Board of Eduation."
116,116,"Maybe you're used to light from street lamps streaming into your bedroom window every night...

Or bright lights beaming down on you from car dealerships, grocery stores and big box retailers' parking lots as you go for an evening drive.

But there's a dark side to living somewhere with a lot of artificial outdoor light...

It increases your chest cancer risk.

In fact, researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health recently found that women with the highest exposure to outdoor lighting had a 14 percent higher risk of developing chest cancer.

These results are alarming -- especially since exposure to outdoor lighting is a problem faced by a heck of a lot of women. It affects pretty much everyone except those living in very rural areas.

""In our modern industrialized society, artificial lighting is nearly ubiquitous,"" said lead author if this latest study Peter James, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School's Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute. ""Our results suggest that this widespread exposure to outdoor lights during nighttime hours could represent a novel risk factor for chest cancer.""

Shining a light on this unusual chest cancer risk factor...

Harvard's study is the most comprehensive study ever to examine the connection between outdoor lighting and chest cancer risk. It included data from close to 110,000 women who were enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study II from 1989-2013.

Researchers compared the health data from the Nurses' Health Study with satellite images of the earth that showed how much outdoor lighting individual participants were exposed to. Those who fell in the top fifth when it came to outdoor light exposure had a 14 percent higher risk of chest cancer than those who fell in the bottom fifth. The risk was highest of all among women who worked night shifts.

Now, you should know, the increased chest cancer risk only applied to women who were premenopausal and were smokers at some point in their lives. But that still includes a heck of a lot of women. And it leaves you wondering, why is there a connection at all?

Based on previous research, researchers believe the most likely culprit behind this unusual cancer risk factor is body clock disruption. Basically, exposure to light at night may decrease levels of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin in your body, which throws your circadian rhythm out-of-whack.

In fact, previous studies in mice show that exposing them to irregular light patterns or altering their body clock through gene manipulation makes them more prone to cancer...especially aggressive, fast-growing tumors.

On the flip side, previous studies also show that melatonin has cancer-fighting abilities. It can boost the effectiveness of conventional chest cancer treatments by wiping out chest cancer cells they miss.

Now, since your body's production of melatonin is regulated by how much light you're exposed to, is it any wonder that chest cancer and evening outdoor lighting exposure are connected?

Short of going off-the-grid, what can you do to keep your outdoor lighting exposure (and chest cancer risk) down?

Well, getting blackout curtains or blinds is a good starting point. Limiting exposure to certain indoor lights at night (like the blue light from TV screens, smartphones and computers) can help keep your circadian rhythm in order too. And steer clear of alcohol and caffeine in the evening, because both of those beverages will hamper healthy melatonin levels.

You may also want to consider taking a melatonin supplement at night. Research suggests it can cut your chest cancer risk while giving you a better night's sleep to boot."
117,117,"In health care, you could say radiologists have typically had a pretty sweet deal. They make, on average, around $400,000 a year -- nearly double what a family doctor makes -- and often have less grueling hours. But if you talk with radiologists in training at the University of California, San Francisco, it quickly becomes clear that the once-certain golden path is no longer so secure.

""The biggest concern is that we could be replaced by machines,"" says Phelps Kelley, a fourth-year radiology fellow. He's sitting inside a dimly lit reading room, looking at digital images from the CT scan of a patient's chest, trying to figure out why he's short of breath.

Because MRI and CT scans are now routine procedures and all the data can be stored digitally, the number of images radiologists have to assess has risen dramatically. These days, a radiologist at UCSF will go through anywhere from 20 to 100 scans a day, and each scan can have thousands of images to review.

""Radiology has become commoditized over the years,"" Kelley says. ""People don't want interaction with a radiologist, they just want a piece of paper that says what the CT shows.""

'Computers are awfully good at seeing patterns'

That basic analysis is something he predicts computers will be able to do.

Dr. Bob Wachter, an internist at UCSF and author of The Digital Doctor, says radiology is particularly amenable to takeover by artificial intelligence like machine learning.

""Radiology, at its core, is now a human being, based on learning and his or her own experience, looking at a collection of digital dots and a digital pattern and saying 'That pattern looks like cancer or looks like tuberculosis or looks like pneumonia,' "" he says. ""Computers are awfully good at seeing patterns.""

Just think about how Facebook software can identify your face in a group photo, or Google's can recognize a stop sign. Big tech companies are betting the same machine learning process -- training a computer by feeding it thousands of images -- could make it possible for an algorithm to diagnose heart disease or strokes faster and cheaper than a human can.

UCSF radiologist Dr. Marc Kohli says there is plenty of angst among radiologists today.

""You can't walk through any of our meetings without hearing people talk about machine learning,"" Kohli says.

Both Kohli and his colleague Dr. John Mongan are researching ways to use artificial intelligence in radiology. As part of a UCSF collaboration with GE, Mongan is helping teach machines to distinguish between normal and abnormal chest X-rays so doctors can prioritize patients with life-threatening conditions. He says the people most fearful about AI understand the least about it. From his office just north of Silicon Valley, he compares the climate to that of the dot-com bubble.

""People were sure about the way things were going to go,"" Mongan says. ""Webvan had billions of dollars and was going to put all the groceries out of business. There's still a Safeway half a mile from my house. But at the same time, it wasn't all hype.""

'You need them working together'

The reality is this: dozens of companies, including IBM, Google and GE, are racing to develop formulas that could one day make diagnoses from medical images. It's not an easy task: to write the complex problem-solving formulas, developers need access to a tremendous amount of health data.

Health care companies like vRad, which has radiologists analyzing 7 million scans a year, provide data to partners that develop medical algorithms.

The data has been used to ""create algorithms to detect the risk of acute strokes and hemorrhages"" and help off-site radiologists prioritize their work, says Dr. Benjamin Strong, chief medical officer at vRad.

Zebra Medical Vision, an Israeli company, provides algorithms to hospitals across the U.S. that help radiologists predict disease. Chief Medical Officer Eldad Elnekave says computers can detect diseases from images better than humans because they can multitask -- say, look for appendicitis while also checking for low bone density.

""The radiologist can't make 30 diagnoses for every study. But the evidence is there, the information is in the pixels,"" Elnekave says.

Still, UCSF's Mongan isn't worried about losing his job.

""When we're talking about the machines doing things radiologists can't do, we're not talking about a machine where you can just drop an MRI in it and walk away and the answer gets spit out better than a radiologist,"" he says. ""A CT does things better than a radiologist. But that CT scanner by itself doesn't do much good. You need them working together.""

In the short term, Mongan is excited algorithms could help him prioritize patients and make sure he doesn't miss something. Long term, he says radiologists will spend less time looking at images and more time selecting algorithms and interpreting results.

Kohli says in addition to embracing artificial intelligence, radiologists need to make themselves more visible by coming out of those dimly lit reading rooms.

""We're largely hidden from the patients,"" Kohli says. ""We're nearly completely invisible, with the exception of my name shows up on a bill, which is a problem.""

Wachter believes increasing collaboration between radiologists and doctors is also critical.

""At UCSF, we're having conversations about [radiologists] coming out of their room and working with us. The more they can become real consultants, I think that will help,"" he says.

Kelley, the radiology fellow, says young radiologists who don't shy away from AI will have a far more certain future. His analogy? Uber and the taxi business.

""If the taxi industry had invested in ride-hailing apps maybe they wouldn't be going out of business and Uber wouldn't be taking them over,"" Kelley says. ""So if we can actually own [AI], then we can maybe benefit from it and not be wiped out by it.""

At least for now, Kelley offers what a computer can't -- a diagnosis with a face-to-face explanation."

121,121,"In health care, you could say radiologists have typically had a pretty sweet deal. They make, on average, around $400,000 a year -- nearly double what a family doctor makes -- and often have less grueling hours. But if you talk with radiologists in training at the University of California, San Francisco, it quickly becomes clear that the once-certain golden path is no longer so secure.

""The biggest concern is that we could be replaced by machines,"" says Phelps Kelley, a fourth-year radiology fellow. He's sitting inside a dimly lit reading room, looking at digital images from the CT scan of a patient's chest, trying to figure out why he's short of breath.

Because MRI and CT scans are now routine procedures and all the data can be stored digitally, the number of images radiologists have to assess has risen dramatically. These days, a radiologist at UCSF will go through anywhere from 20 to 100 scans a day, and each scan can have thousands of images to review.

""Radiology has become commoditized over the years,"" Kelley says. ""People don't want interaction with a radiologist, they just want a piece of paper that says what the CT shows.""

'Computers are awfully good at seeing patterns'

That basic analysis is something he predicts computers will be able to do.

Dr. Bob Wachter, an internist at UCSF and author of The Digital Doctor, says radiology is particularly amenable to takeover by artificial intelligence like machine learning.

""Radiology, at its core, is now a human being, based on learning and his or her own experience, looking at a collection of digital dots and a digital pattern and saying 'That pattern looks like cancer or looks like tuberculosis or looks like pneumonia,' "" he says. ""Computers are awfully good at seeing patterns.""

Just think about how Facebook software can identify your face in a group photo, or Google's can recognize a stop sign. Big tech companies are betting the same machine learning process -- training a computer by feeding it thousands of images -- could make it possible for an algorithm to diagnose heart disease or strokes faster and cheaper than a human can.

UCSF radiologist Dr. Marc Kohli says there is plenty of angst among radiologists today.

""You can't walk through any of our meetings without hearing people talk about machine learning,"" Kohli says.

Both Kohli and his colleague Dr. John Mongan are researching ways to use artificial intelligence in radiology. As part of a UCSF collaboration with GE, Mongan is helping teach machines to distinguish between normal and abnormal chest X-rays so doctors can prioritize patients with life-threatening conditions. He says the people most fearful about AI understand the least about it. From his office just north of Silicon Valley, he compares the climate to that of the dot-com bubble.

""People were sure about the way things were going to go,"" Mongan says. ""Webvan had billions of dollars and was going to put all the groceries out of business. There's still a Safeway half a mile from my house. But at the same time, it wasn't all hype.""

'You need them working together'

The reality is this: dozens of companies, including IBM, Google and GE, are racing to develop formulas that could one day make diagnoses from medical images. It's not an easy task: to write the complex problem-solving formulas, developers need access to a tremendous amount of health data.

Health care companies like vRad, which has radiologists analyzing 7 million scans a year, provide data to partners that develop medical algorithms.

The data has been used to ""create algorithms to detect the risk of acute strokes and hemorrhages"" and help off-site radiologists prioritize their work, says Dr. Benjamin Strong, chief medical officer at vRad.

Zebra Medical Vision, an Israeli company, provides algorithms to hospitals across the U.S. that help radiologists predict disease. Chief Medical Officer Eldad Elnekave says computers can detect diseases from images better than humans because they can multitask -- say, look for appendicitis while also checking for low bone density.

""The radiologist can't make 30 diagnoses for every study. But the evidence is there, the information is in the pixels,"" Elnekave says.

Still, UCSF's Mongan isn't worried about losing his job.

""When we're talking about the machines doing things radiologists can't do, we're not talking about a machine where you can just drop an MRI in it and walk away and the answer gets spit out better than a radiologist,"" he says. ""A CT does things better than a radiologist. But that CT scanner by itself doesn't do much good. You need them working together.""

In the short term, Mongan is excited algorithms could help him prioritize patients and make sure he doesn't miss something. Long term, he says radiologists will spend less time looking at images and more time selecting algorithms and interpreting results.

Kohli says in addition to embracing artificial intelligence, radiologists need to make themselves more visible by coming out of those dimly lit reading rooms.

""We're largely hidden from the patients,"" Kohli says. ""We're nearly completely invisible, with the exception of my name shows up on a bill, which is a problem.""

Wachter believes increasing collaboration between radiologists and doctors is also critical.

""At UCSF, we're having conversations about [radiologists] coming out of their room and working with us. The more they can become real consultants, I think that will help,"" he says.

Kelley, the radiology fellow, says young radiologists who don't shy away from AI will have a far more certain future. His analogy? Uber and the taxi business.

""If the taxi industry had invested in ride-hailing apps maybe they wouldn't be going out of business and Uber wouldn't be taking them over,"" Kelley says. ""So if we can actually own [AI], then we can maybe benefit from it and not be wiped out by it.""

127,127,"In health care, you could say radiologists have typically had a pretty sweet deal. They make, on average, around $400,000 a year -- nearly double what a family doctor makes -- and often have less grueling hours. But if you talk with radiologists in training at the University of California, San Francisco, it quickly becomes clear that the once-certain golden path is no longer so secure.

""The biggest concern is that we could be replaced by machines,"" says Phelps Kelley, a fourth-year radiology fellow. He's sitting inside a dimly lit reading room, looking at digital images from the CT scan of a patient's chest, trying to figure out why he's short of breath.

Because MRI and CT scans are now routine procedures and all the data can be stored digitally, the number of images radiologists have to assess has risen dramatically. These days, a radiologist at UCSF will go through anywhere from 20 to 100 scans a day, and each scan can have thousands of images to review.

""Radiology has become commoditized over the years,"" Kelley says. ""People don't want interaction with a radiologist, they just want a piece of paper that says what the CT shows.""

'Computers are awfully good at seeing patterns'

That basic analysis is something he predicts computers will be able to do.

Dr. Bob Wachter, an internist at UCSF and author of The Digital Doctor, says radiology is particularly amenable to takeover by artificial intelligence like machine learning.

""Radiology, at its core, is now a human being, based on learning and his or her own experience, looking at a collection of digital dots and a digital pattern and saying 'That pattern looks like cancer or looks like tuberculosis or looks like pneumonia,' "" he says. ""Computers are awfully good at seeing patterns.""

Just think about how Facebook software can identify your face in a group photo, or Google's can recognize a stop sign. Big tech companies are betting the same machine learning process -- training a computer by feeding it thousands of images -- could make it possible for an algorithm to diagnose heart disease or strokes faster and cheaper than a human can.

UCSF radiologist Dr. Marc Kohli says there is plenty of angst among radiologists today.

""You can't walk through any of our meetings without hearing people talk about machine learning,"" Kohli says.

Both Kohli and his colleague Dr. John Mongan are researching ways to use artificial intelligence in radiology. As part of a UCSF collaboration with GE, Mongan is helping teach machines to distinguish between normal and abnormal chest X-rays so doctors can prioritize patients with life-threatening conditions. He says the people most fearful about AI understand the least about it. From his office just north of Silicon Valley, he compares the climate to that of the dot-com bubble.

""People were sure about the way things were going to go,"" Mongan says. ""Webvan had billions of dollars and was going to put all the groceries out of business. There's still a Safeway half a mile from my house. But at the same time, it wasn't all hype.""

'You need them working together'

The reality is this: dozens of companies, including IBM, Google and GE, are racing to develop formulas that could one day make diagnoses from medical images. It's not an easy task: to write the complex problem-solving formulas, developers need access to a tremendous amount of health data.

Health care companies like vRad, which has radiologists analyzing 7 million scans a year, provide data to partners that develop medical algorithms.

The data has been used to ""create algorithms to detect the risk of acute strokes and hemorrhages"" and help off-site radiologists prioritize their work, says Dr. Benjamin Strong, chief medical officer at vRad.

Zebra Medical Vision, an Israeli company, provides algorithms to hospitals across the U.S. that help radiologists predict disease. Chief Medical Officer Eldad Elnekave says computers can detect diseases from images better than humans because they can multitask -- say, look for appendicitis while also checking for low bone density.

""The radiologist can't make 30 diagnoses for every study. But the evidence is there, the information is in the pixels,"" Elnekave says.

Still, UCSF's Mongan isn't worried about losing his job.

""When we're talking about the machines doing things radiologists can't do, we're not talking about a machine where you can just drop an MRI in it and walk away and the answer gets spit out better than a radiologist,"" he says. ""A CT does things better than a radiologist. But that CT scanner by itself doesn't do much good. You need them working together.""

In the short term, Mongan is excited algorithms could help him prioritize patients and make sure he doesn't miss something. Long term, he says radiologists will spend less time looking at images and more time selecting algorithms and interpreting results.

Kohli says in addition to embracing artificial intelligence, radiologists need to make themselves more visible by coming out of those dimly lit reading rooms.

""We're largely hidden from the patients,"" Kohli says. ""We're nearly completely invisible, with the exception of my name shows up on a bill, which is a problem.""

Wachter believes increasing collaboration between radiologists and doctors is also critical.

They make, on average, around $400,000 a year -- nearly double what a family doctor makes -- and often have less grueling hours. But if you talk with radiologists in training at the University of California, San Francisco, it quickly becomes clear that the once-certain golden path is no longer so secure.

""The biggest concern is that we could be replaced by machines,"" says Phelps Kelley, a fourth-year radiology fellow. He's sitting inside a dimly lit reading room, looking at digital images from the CT scan of a patient's chest, trying to figure out why he's short of breath.

Because MRI and CT scans are now routine procedures and all the data can be stored digitally, the number of images radiologists have to assess has risen dramatically. These days, a radiologist at UCSF will go through anywhere from 20 to 100 scans a day, and each scan can have thousands of images to review.

""Radiology has become commoditized over the years,"" Kelley says. ""People don't want interaction with a radiologist, they just want a piece of paper that says what the CT shows.""

'Computers are awfully good at seeing patterns'

That basic analysis is something he predicts computers will be able to do.

Dr. Bob Wachter, an internist at UCSF and author of The Digital Doctor, says radiology is particularly amenable to takeover by artificial intelligence like machine learning.

""Radiology, at its core, is now a human being, based on learning and his or her own experience, looking at a collection of digital dots and a digital pattern and saying 'That pattern looks like cancer or looks like tuberculosis or looks like pneumonia,' "" he says. ""Computers are awfully good at seeing patterns.""

Just think about how Facebook software can identify your face in a group photo, or Google's can recognize a stop sign. Big tech companies are betting the same machine learning process -- training a computer by feeding it thousands of images -- could make it possible for an algorithm to diagnose heart disease or strokes faster and cheaper than a human can.

UCSF radiologist Dr. Marc Kohli says there is plenty of angst among radiologists today.

""You can't walk through any of our meetings without hearing people talk about machine learning,"" Kohli says.

Both Kohli and his colleague Dr. John Mongan are researching ways to use artificial intelligence in radiology. As part of a UCSF collaboration with GE, Mongan is helping teach machines to distinguish between normal and abnormal chest X-rays so doctors can prioritize patients with life-threatening conditions. He says the people most fearful about AI understand the least about it. From his office just north of Silicon Valley, he compares the climate to that of the dot-com bubble.

""People were sure about the way things were going to go,"" Mongan says. ""Webvan had billions of dollars and was going to put all the groceries out of business. There's still a Safeway half a mile from my house. But at the same time, it wasn't all hype.""

'You need them working together'

The reality is this: dozens of companies, including IBM, Google and GE, are racing to develop formulas that could one day make diagnoses from medical images. It's not an easy task: to write the complex problem-solving formulas, developers need access to a tremendous amount of health data.

Health care companies like vRad, which has radiologists analyzing 7 million scans a year, provide data to partners that develop medical algorithms.

The data has been used to ""create algorithms to detect the risk of acute strokes and hemorrhages"" and help off-site radiologists prioritize their work, says Dr. Benjamin Strong, chief medical officer at vRad.

Zebra Medical Vision, an Israeli company, provides algorithms to hospitals across the U.S. that help radiologists predict disease. Chief Medical Officer Eldad Elnekave says computers can detect diseases from images better than humans because they can multitask -- say, look for appendicitis while also checking for low bone density.

""The radiologist can't make 30 diagnoses for every study. But the evidence is there, the information is in the pixels,"" Elnekave says.

Still, UCSF's Mongan isn't worried about losing his job.

""When we're talking about the machines doing things radiologists can't do, we're not talking about a machine where you can just drop an MRI in it and walk away and the answer gets spit out better than a radiologist,"" he says. ""A CT does things better than a radiologist. But that CT scanner by itself doesn't do much good. You need them working together.""

In the short term, Mongan is excited algorithms could help him prioritize patients and make sure he doesn't miss something. Long term, he says radiologists will spend less time looking at images and more time selecting algorithms and interpreting results.

Kohli says in addition to embracing artificial intelligence, radiologists need to make themselves more visible by coming out of those dimly lit reading rooms.

Asked to name important inventors and you might start with Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell or Leonardo da Vinci.

But what about Mary Anderson? Or Ann Tsukamoto?

You might not know their names, but they are just two of the female inventors behind everyday objects and scientific innovations.

BBC 100 Women, the season featuring stories of inspiring and influential women, is taking on a new challenge.

This year, women from around the world will be asked to come up with innovations to tackle some of the biggest problems they face.

Scroll down for more information about 100 Women - and, for more inspiration, here are nine inventions we wouldn't have, if it weren't for ground-breaking women.

After joining the US Navy during the Second World War, Rear Admiral Grace Hopper was assigned to work on a new computer, called the Mark 1.

It wasn't long before she was at the forefront of computer programming in the 1950s.

She was behind the compiler, which could translate instructions into code that computers can read, making programming quicker and ultimately revolutionising how computers worked.

Hopper also helped popularised the term ""de-bugging"" that we still use on computers programmes today, after a moth was removed from inside her machine.

""Amazing Grace"", as she was known, continued working with computers until she retired from the navy as its oldest serving officer, aged 79.

Dr Shirley Ann Jackson is an American theoretical physicist, whose research from the 1970s is responsible for caller ID and call waiting.

Her breakthroughs in telecommunications have also enabled others to invent the portable fax, fibre optic cables and solar cells.

She is the first African-American woman to gain a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the first African-American woman to lead a top-ranked research university.

On a winter's day of 1903, Mary Anderson was visiting New York City when she noticed that her driver was forced to open his window, just to the clear the snow from his windscreen.

Every time the window was open, the passengers in the car got colder.

Anderson started drawing her solution of a rubber blade that could be moved from inside the car, and in 1903 was awarded a patent for her device.

But the invention proved unsuccessful with car companies, who believed it would distract drivers.

Anderson never profited from her invention, even when the wipers later became standard on cars.

It might not have the catchiest name on this list, but the long cycle-life nickel-hydrogen battery has helped power the International Space Station, so it's pretty important.

Olga D Gonzalez-Sanabria, who is originally from Puerto Rico, developed technology which helped create these batteries in the 1980s and is now director of engineering at Nasa's Glenn Research Centre.

A frequent entertainer, Cochrane wanted a machine that would wash her dishes faster than her servants, and be less likely to break them.

Her machine, which involved a motor turning a wheel inside a copper boiler, was the first automatic dishwasher to use water pressure.

Cochrane's alcoholic husband had left her with masses of debt after his death and this motivated her to patent her invention in 1886 and open her own production factory.

A nurse, who was often home alone, Marie Van Brittan Brown came up with an idea that would make her feel safer.

Together with her husband Albert, Van Brittan Brown developed the first home security system in response to the rising crime rates and slow police responses of the 1960s.

The device was complicated, with a camera powered by a motor which moved up and down the door to look through a peephole.

A monitor in her bedroom also came equipped with an alarm button.

Her patent was awarded in 1991 and since then Tsukamoto's work has led to great advancements in understanding the blood systems of cancer patients, which could lead to a cure for the disease.

Tsukamoto is currently conducting further research into stem cell growth and is the co-patentee on more than seven other inventions.

This chemist invented the lightweight fibre used in bullet-proof vests and body armour.

Since her discovery in 1965, the material, which is five times stronger than steel, has saved lives and is used by millions every day.

It's found in products ranging from household gloves and mobiles phones to aeroplanes and suspension bridges.

A man named Charles Darrow is often credited with creating the most popular board game in history, but the rules were in fact invented by Elizabeth Magie.

Magie wanted to demonstrate the problems with capitalism with an innovative game in which players traded fake money and property.

Her design, which she patented in 1904, was called The Landlord's Game.

The game of Monopoly that we know today was published in 1935 by the Parker Brothers, who discovered that Darrow was not the sole creator and had, for just $500 (£385), bought Magie's patent and, well, monopolised the game."

Generating gelatin-based nanoparticles

What is common between albumin, gelatin and casein? They are all proteins used for the synthesis of nanoparticles. Desolvation is a common process to construct nanoparticles in which this balance of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions is disturbed, causing a protein to damage its 3D structure.

Researchers from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, have studied the desolvation process of gelatin. This will provide insights into the gelatin nanoparticle assembly and could improve the process of drug delivery through nanoparticles.

SimYog, an Indian start-up, presented one of their latest innovations - Compliance-Scope at the IEEE EMC Conference recently. It is a 3D, virtual EMI EMC laboratory that allows users to explore and improve circuit board and other hardware. It also allows users to create a 3D electromagnetic simulation of the hardware, with the ability to be embedded in the circuit board and validates the function of its electrical components and detect errors. The device not only allows users to diagnose and find solutions in an immersive 3D virtual space.

How acidic is rain?

Acid rain is quite a popular term these days. Environmental scientists describe it as an adverse effect of increasing pollution due to recent human activities. But even before humans started evolving on earth, proof of acid rains have been found.

It was around 250 million years ago; the most devastating case of mass extinction in earth's history was caused by acid rain due to volcanic eruption in the Siberian region. Acidity of rain is measured using the pH scale. A pH of less than 7 is acidic and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Surprisingly, rain is always acidic compared to water. Scientists consider a pH of 5.6 as neutral pH in the case of rainwater. Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, emitted from cars and various industries, make rainwater more

acidic. So how acidic could rainwater be? Studies say it could be as low as pH 2. This highly acidic water can directly affect human eye and skin. But fortunately, rains with high acidity are very rare.

USA

Visual guides

A study published in Psychological Science found that taking photos during an experience helped people remember visuals more accurately, even when they did not revisit their photos. However, snapping pictures also appeared to decrease how much spoken information people retained. The findings suggest that the process of looking around for what to photograph ""actually causes you to encode visual content and remember it,"" said Alix Barasch, one of the authors and an assistant professor at the New York University.

Europe

Random choice-making

The ability to behave randomly can be a great asset. Recently, a team from Europe pitted humans and computers against one another in a series of tasks designed to measure random choice-making. Around age 25, the researchers determined, people are best able to produce a random result.

Triggers of a autoimmune attack

A research team led by Michael Carroll of Boston Children's Hospital, USA and Harvard Medical School, USA, has spent years investigating mouse models of lupus to better understand the ins and outs of autoimmune diseases.

Their latest findings, published in Cell, reveal that rogue B cells can trigger an 'override' that launches the body into an autoimmune attack.

139,139,"Florence Devouard, leader of WikiFundi, uses Wikipedia as a platform to bring tech skills to people with low access to broadband.

In developed countries, the ability to access and edit Wikipedia easily is taken for granted, but in many African countries, where access to reliable electricity and broadband are limited, that's not the case. I recently interviewed Florence Devouard, who is working on several open source projects to help close gaps caused by poor access to online information. She is co-leader of the WikiFundi project, as well as other projects related to Wikipedia and Africa, including Wiki Loves Women, a women's information initiative, and Wiki Loves Africa, a media contest that invites the public to contribute photographs, videos, and audio to Wikipedia. All projects are part of the WikiAfrica movement.

Florence brings to these projects her 15 years of experience in project management, online communities, and knowledge sharing, as well as a passion that is palpable and drives her vision to empower people (and particularly women) in Africa with information.

The WikiFundi project is trying to create a way for people in areas of Africa with limited or no broadband connectivity to contribute to Wikipedia. Its name is a combination of ""wiki"" and ""fundi,"" a Bantu word that means ""a learned person.""

WikiFundi is an offline editing environment that mimics Wikipedia, enabling editors to write collaboratively offline. It also helps wikipedians train newcomers, including students and teachers, to contribute, and supports Wikipedia volunteers in their outreach activities.

WikiFundi is not only about creating and sharing information. Florence says, ""By and large, most of the uses of WikiFundi are oriented toward training future Wikipedians; those might be adults, students, or children. The goal is not only to get new Wikipedia articles, but to provide new skills to all those people (how to work together, how to write neutrally, how to deal with conflict, how to search and double check information and facts, critical thinking, etc.).""

The project operates several programs, including:

WikiFundi collaborates with Wikimedia CH (the Swiss chapter of the Wikipedia movement) and Emmanuel Englehart (co-developer of Kiwix, an integral part of the Internet in a Box environment), with funding support provided by the Orange Foundation (as a complement to its Digital Schools program, which reaches over 130,000 students in Africa).

Florence is also involved with the Wiki Loves Women project, which publishes information about issues affecting women in Africa, such as forced marriages, breast cancer, and violence against women, on Wikipedia. It's based on the GLAM Wiki (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) model, which ""helps cultural institutions share their resources with the world through collaborative projects with experienced Wikipedia editors.""

Wiki Loves Women teams located in Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroun, Nigeria, and Ghana set up partnerships with local nonprofits or public institutions to collect content and publish it on Wikipedia under a free license. The project also can use WikiFundi to train women and girls through programs including Girls in Tech, Tech Needs Girls, and Women Who Code.

Florence is confident that these types of projects can change the lives of women in Africa for the better. She says, ""For many people around the world, the internet is where they come to play, to express themselves, to get information, to learn... When it comes to Africa, its people, histories and communities, the available information remains shockingly inaccurate, incomplete, or even missing. This reinforces the negative, single story about Africa.

""This is particularly true for women, who may not see online their realities, their interests, and their lives reflected. That leaves them disempowered, excluded, and feeling that what they have to say is neither valued nor valuable. Open-access information and material can help change the status quo in helping women get access to so much more information to support their needs in their daily lives, but also to join the conversation and share their own knowledge worldwide.""

""The ability to share our own knowledge with others is an incredibly powerful means to make us feel good, feel empowered, feel so much pride that ... new strengths emerge,"" Florence says. In community-based projects like WikiFundi, ""the effort and the cost to collect, clarify, organize, and disseminate information is divided between millions of people who want to make the world a better place beyond frontiers, politicians, religions, colors, etc.""

She describes these types of projects like a big river, slowly moving toward the sea. ""The river sometimes is tumultuous, sometimes there is a flood, or it is only a trickle. Sometimes the river will get out of its bed and choose another path in the plain, disturbing the local fauna and flora. But always will it go to the sea,"" she says.

As with most open source projects, WikiFundi, Wiki Loves Women, and Wiki Loves Africa are continually seeking new contributors. ""Nobody knows everything but everybody knows something. Aren't we all experts in a way?"" Florence says.

Although experts in wikis and collaborative tools are always needed, Florence says that volunteers with structured data expertise are greatly needed. ""I think structured data is going to be very important in the future. I'm not convinced that our current tools to manipulate structured data are collaborative enough,"" she says.

WikiFundi's image can be downloaded, and the README on GitHub provides detailed information on the install and dependencies. It works best on Linux and Windows computers, which fortunately are the dominant operating systems used in Africa."
140,140,"★★★☆☆ Frederick Wiseman enters the fray for the Golden Lion with Ex Libris, a three-hour-plus-change piece on the New York Public Library system. It's more interesting than a three-hour documentary about libraries has any right to be, but not quite as fascinating as hoped.

""A library is not just a place to store books,"" an academic declares about halfway through Ex Libris. And indeed the thesis of the film is successfully proved. The library unveils itself as an amalgam of activity, a community, a workplace, a refuge, a school and a city. Anyone aware of Wiseman's recent work - At Berkeley, National Gallery - will already be prepared for Ex Libris. The methodology is in place, as are the themes - large institutions looked at hard and long, an accumulation of detail, a patient out-waiting for interest to emerge from the footage.

Wiseman's latest covers the New York Public Library system in a number of locations throughout New York - there are 92 branches in total, though the film spirals back to the center of gravity represented by the Stephen A. Schwartzman Building that starred in Ghostbusters. Here we see the big hitters like Richard Dawkins talking in free lunchtime readings. We also have the various archives and research facilities, educational drop in centers for after school, the board meetings, the public outreach, the behind the scenes packing and sorting of books.

The meeting of the board struggle with issues of funding and mission. Following years of underfunding, they are finally beginning to succeed in getting some city funds back into the library system. They still need to contend with getting more every year and primary to doing that is to give the politicians a clear message as to what the library is actually there for and how it can survive as essentially a socialist idea in the cut and thrust capital of capitalism. Among the talks, minorities, black history and even Marx get a good airing before a curious, or dozing citizenry.

The library also has to adapt to new technology and help those living in what is called the 'digital dark', with no access to the internet. They loan out wifi hubs and phones as well as providing computers for people to access the web. We see a cancer patient researching his illness; children learning programming code to make robots move. These along instances along with the audiobooks being recorded for the visually impaired and a thousand other services show how essential the library is to many citizens.

It therefore feels churlish to criticize the film, given that its own mission is to promote an idea of community and inclusion - ""to create a kinder gentler world"" according to one librarian - currently under radical attack. However, Ex Libris omits a lot of the arguments - either full throated on large policy issues or petty bickering on whether someone paid their library fines or not. It also omits the audience's applause to the various speakers. The voices are administrators and public speakers, not the homeless who shelter in the library or the users or cleaners. It's as if Wiseman has taken his cue from the old style librarians and has wanted to give a portrait of a community but without the inevitable noise that goes with it, issuing one long ""shhhhhhhhh""!

142,142,"Asked to name important inventors and you might start with Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell or Leonardo da Vinci.

But what about Mary Anderson? Or Ann Tsukamoto?

You might not know their names, but they are just two of the female inventors behind everyday objects and scientific innovations.

BBC 100 Women, the season featuring stories of inspiring and influential women, is taking on a new challenge.

This year, women from around the world will be asked to come up with innovations to tackle some of the biggest problems they face.

Scroll down for more information about 100 Women - and, for more inspiration, here are nine inventions we wouldn't have, if it weren't for ground-breaking women.

After joining the US Navy during the Second World War, Admiral Grace Hopper was assigned to work on a new computer, called the Mark 1.

It wasn't long before she was at the forefront of computer programming.

In 1952 she created the first compiler, which could translate worded instructions into code that computers can read, making programming quicker and ultimately revolutionising how computers worked.

Hopper also popularised the term ""de-bugging"" that we still use on computers programmes today, after a moth was removed from inside her machine.

""Amazing Grace"", as she was known, continued working with computers until she retired from the navy as its oldest serving officer, aged 79.

Dr Shirley Ann Jackson is an American theoretical physicist, whose research from the 1970s is responsible for caller ID and call waiting.

Her breakthroughs in telecommunications have also enabled others to invent the portable fax, fibre optic cables and solar cells.

She is the first African-American woman to gain a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the first African-American woman to lead a top-ranked research university.

On a winter's day of 1903, Mary Anderson was visiting New York City when she noticed that her driver was forced to open his window, just to the clear the snow from his windscreen.

Every time the window was open, the passengers in the car got colder.

Anderson started drawing her solution of a rubber blade that could be moved from inside the car, and in 1903 was awarded the patent for her device.

But the invention proved unsuccessful with car companies, who believed it would distract drivers.

Anderson never profited from her invention, even when the wipers later became standard on cars.

It might not have the catchiest name on this list, but the long cycle-life nickel-hydrogen battery has helped power the International Space Station, so it's pretty important.

Olga D Gonzalez-Sanabria, who is originally from Puerto Rico, developed the technology in the 1980s and is now director of engineering at Nasa's Glenn Research Centre.

BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. In 2017, we're challenging them to tackle four of the biggest problems facing women today - the glass ceiling, female illiteracy, harassment in public spaces and sexism in sport.

With your help, they'll be coming up with real-life solutions and we want you to get involved with your ideas. Find us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and use #100Women

A frequent entertainer, Cochrane wanted a machine that would wash her dishes faster than her servants, and be less likely to break them.

Her machine, which involved a motor turning a wheel inside a copper boiler, was the first automatic dishwasher to use water pressure.

Cochrane's alcoholic husband had left her with masses of debt after his death and this motivated her to patent her invention in 1886 and open her own production factory.

A nurse, who was often home alone, Marie Van Brittan Brown came up with an idea that would make her feel safer.

Together with her husband Albert, Van Brittan Brown developed the first home security system in response to the rising crime rates and slow police responses of the 1960s.

The device was complicated, with a camera powered by a motor which moved up and down the door to look through a peephole.

A monitor in her bedroom also came equipped with an alarm button.

Her patent was awarded in 1991 and since then Tsukamoto's work has led to great advancements in understanding the blood systems of cancer patients, which could lead to a cure for the disease.

Tsukamoto is currently conducting further research into stem cell growth and is the co-patentee on more than seven other inventions.

This chemist invented the lightweight fibre used in bullet-proof vests and body armour.

Since her discovery in 1965, the material, which is five times stronger than steel, has saved millions of lives and is used by millions every day.

It's found in products ranging from household gloves and mobiles phones to aeroplanes and suspension bridges.

A man named Charles Darrow is often credited with creating the most popular board game in history, but the rules were in fact invented by Elizabeth Magie.

Magie wanted to demonstrate the accumulation of wealth with an innovative game in which players traded fake money and property.

Her design, which she patented in 1904, was called The Landlord's Game.

The game of Monopoly that we know today was published in 1935 by the Parker Brothers, who discovered that Darrow was not the sole creator and had, for just $500 (£385), bought Magie's patent and, well, monopolised the game."
143,143,"The Trump administration said Sunday that it wants Congress to attach aid for victims of Hurricane Harvey to a bill that would increase the federal debt limit, a move that clashes with an influential group of House conservatives who have warned GOP leaders not to connect the two funding initiatives.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin revealed the administration's approach Sunday morning, when he was asked if the White House could guarantee that funding for the disaster would not be attached to the fight in Washington over the debt ceiling.

""No, I can't. Quite the contrary,"" Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday. ""The president and I believe that it should be tied to the Harvey funding.""

Mnuchin argued that if the debt ceiling is not raised, funding to help Texas recover from the hurricane could be delayed.

""Our first priority is to make sure that the state gets money, it is critical, and to do that we need to make sure we raise the debt limit,"" he said. ""Without raising the debt limit, I'm not comfortable that we will get the money that we need this month to Texas to rebuild.""

If the debt ceiling isn't raised soon, the U.S. government will only have enough funds to continue operations through Sept. 29, Mnuchin has told lawmakers. Appropriating emergency money to help with the Harvey response will accelerate that deadline by several days, Mnuchin has said.

After a week as a city under siege, Houston continued to operate as a city in recovery on Sunday, as more and more residents began salvaging what little they could of their flooded homes and lives.

Some returned to their houses for the first time, pulling out rotting furniture and waterlogged clothes and piling them in ever-expanding mounds by the curbs. Others tried to return to old routines and habits, flocking to newly reopened gyms, playgrounds and restaurants. Baseball came back Saturday, with the Houston Astros playing their first home games since Hurricane Harvey struck. They beat the New York Mets twice on Saturday to sweep a doubleheader.

But it was clear to most in this struggling and still-soggy region that things would not be anywhere close to normal anytime soon.

Floodwaters are expected to linger in Southeast Texas for days, state officials warned. East of Houston, small towns remained inundated, and the nearly 120,000 residents of Beaumont remained without drinking water or even water for flushing toilets.

Firefighters in Crosby, 25 miles northeast of Houston, kept a worried watch over an unstable chemical plant that in recent days has been the scene of explosions and fires that sent a towering pillar of acrid black smoke high into the sky. Federal and local officials expressed concern that the storm's aftermath could bring other industrial accidents, environmental contamination and the potential for sickness and disease.

As the flooding in some parts receded, authorities turned to the grim task of recovering bodies. Forty-five deaths have been confirmed, but that number is expected to rise in coming days.

At least 200,000 homes have been damaged, the Texas Department of Public Safety reported Sunday, with more than 12,750 destroyed. But those numbers also are certain to increase because the estimate excluded areas that officials have not been able to reach. More than 457,000 people have registered so far for disaster assistance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Houston school officials, surveying some buildings for the first time since the hurricane hit last weekend, were stunned by what they encountered.

The storm damaged nearly half of all public schools here, part of the nation's seventh-largest education system, and more than 75 campuses will require major cleanups or repairs that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, officials said. As of Saturday, the damage to 40 district schools had not even been assessed because they still had several feet of water in their classrooms, cafeterias and auditoriums.

""It's not just an assessment of whether they are dry or they're wet,"" said Schools Superintendent Richard Carranza. Workers are trying to check for structural damage, air quality, mold, the integrity of pipes and whether computers and other equipment still work.

That process will take months, but Carranza said he wants to get teachers into as many schools as possible by Friday, with the system's 218,000 students to follow on Sept. 11. The school year had been scheduled to officially start last Monday, when Harvey was pummeling the city with what ultimately was measured as 50 inches of rain.

Officials are considering several scenarios, including consolidating multiple schools onto one campus, mapping creative busing routes and possibly dividing the school day and assigning different groups of students to morning and afternoon sessions.

President Donald Trump and the first lady visited Houston on Saturday, stopping at one of its biggest emergency shelters to talk with storm victims. In public comments, he highlighted the toll on families while also recognizing the relief efforts and praising the way his administration was handling the disaster.

""We saw a lot of happiness,"" Trump said after meeting evacuees in the NRG Center. ""It's been really nice. It's been a wonderful thing. As tough as this was, it's been a wonderful thing, I think even for the country to watch it, for the world to watch.""

Throughout the state's Gulf Coast, residents and officials spent Saturday in an awkward kind of limbo, drumming up optimism for the difficult recovery ahead even as they acknowledged other potential dangers.

Many of the Houston area's Superfund sites - locations designated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency as the country's most intensely polluted places - were flooded. Of those, 11 remain so overrun that authorities have not been able to assess the damage and potential toxic hazards, EPA officials said Saturday.

The Associated Press reported that water from an overflowing river had poured so hard through one site - where the soil contains dioxins and other contaminants linked to birth defects and cancer - that it badly damaged a nearby interstate highway bridge.

Fetid waters greeted many people as they returned to their homes. According to authorities in Humble, north of Houston, one resident found that a new occupant had moved in: a large alligator, lurking under the dining room table.

Another survivor, Tom Cullen, finally got a first look at his parents' house in West Houston.

It was almost a week ago that he had rushed to rescue them as their back yard filled. He borrowed a kayak from a neighbor and piled his mother, 81, and father, 88, in and paddled them to safety.

On Saturday morning, friends passing by the house sent him photos. The pictures showed it was still under almost seven feet of muddy water. Every family photograph, the sofas they sat on for family movie nights, the kitchen where they used to eat together - all still submerged.

""That house is a landmark of memories for all our family,"" he said. ""It is a total devastation that will be with me until the end of days.""

In East Houston, where floodwaters remained as high as four feet in many areas, school officials allowed reporters to tour one building.

Even before the storm, A.G. Hilliard Elementary was facing challenges. The school is in one of the most impoverished communities in the city.

It now confronts a gargantuan challenge, with water pooled around chairs and computers and black-and-white composition books soaked through and strewn all over classroom floors. The entire school smelled rancid and damp on Saturday. A thin layer of dirt covered the floors like brown powdered sugar. Even the blue painted paw prints of the school's mascot at the front entrance were smeared.

The devastation inflicted by Harvey will require workers to tear up the entire vinyl flooring, cut away up to four feet off the walls and apply an antimicrobial treatment to everything, officials explained. Lockers will have to be pulled out, as well as the gym's padded floors.

Rhonda Skillern-Jones, a board of education trustee, broke down in tears as she walked the hallways.

In 2013, the Houston district absorbed the schools in the community into its system after the state shut them down for poor academic performance, financial troubles and mismanagement.

""The kids were pretty far behind on the learning curve. We made a lot of progress with them over time, catching them up and getting them on grade level,"" said Skillern-Jones, who is a mother of five. ""I'm just afraid that this is such a setback for them educationally.""

On her way to the school Saturday morning, she had driven past neighborhood homes where families were pulling out flooring, sheet rock and furniture. She is already worrying that students will have a hard time focusing on learning with their home lives in shambles. The district will have to deal with that trauma before turning its attention back to academics, she said.

For many of the children here, Skillern-Jones explained, Hilliard is one of the few pillars of stability in their lives. ""It's going to take a lot of people pulling together to support these babies.""

Hernández reported from Houston. Wan, Zezima and Shaban reported from Washington. The Washington Post's Todd Frankel in Lake Charles, Louisiana; Emily Wax-Thibodeaux, Philip Rucker and Abigail Hauslohner in Houston; and Amy B Wang and Susan Svrluga in Washington contributed to this report."

HOUSTON -- The Trump administration said Sunday that it wants Congress to attach aid for victims of Hurricane Harvey to a bill that would increase the federal debt limit, a move that clashes with an influential group of House conservatives who have warned GOP leaders not to connect the two funding initiatives.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin revealed the administration's approach Sunday morning, when he was asked if the White House could guarantee that funding for the disaster would not be attached to the fight in Washington over the debt ceiling.

""No, I can't. Quite the contrary,"" Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday. ""The president and I believe that it should be tied to the Harvey funding.""

Mnuchin argued that if the debt ceiling is not raised, funding to help Texas recover from the hurricane could be delayed.

""Our first priority is to make sure that the state gets money, it is critical, and to do that we need to make sure we raise the debt limit,"" he said. ""Without raising the debt limit, I'm not comfortable that we will get the money that we need this month to Texas to rebuild.""

If the debt ceiling isn't raised soon, the U.S. government will only have enough funds to continue operations through Sept. 29, Mnuchin has told lawmakers. Appropriating emergency money to help with the Harvey response will accelerate that deadline by several days, Mnuchin has said.

After a week as a city under siege, Houston continued to operate as a city in recovery on Sunday, as more and more residents began salvaging what little they could of their flooded homes and lives.

Some returned to their houses for the first time, pulling out rotting furniture and waterlogged clothes and piling them in ever-expanding mounds by the curbs. Others tried to return to old routines and habits, flocking to newly reopened gyms, playgrounds and restaurants. Baseball came back Saturday, with the Houston Astros playing their first home games since Hurricane Harvey struck. They beat the New York Mets twice on Saturday to sweep a doubleheader.

But it was clear to most in this struggling and still-soggy region that things would not be anywhere close to normal anytime soon.

Floodwaters are expected to linger in Southeast Texas for days, state officials warned. East of Houston, small towns remained inundated, and the nearly 120,000 residents of Beaumont remained without drinking water or even water for flushing toilets.

Firefighters in Crosby, 25 miles northeast of Houston, kept a worried watch over an unstable chemical plant that in recent days has been the scene of explosions and fires that sent a towering pillar of acrid black smoke high into the sky. Federal and local officials expressed concern that the storm's aftermath could bring other industrial accidents, environmental contamination and the potential for sickness and disease.

As the flooding in some parts receded, authorities turned to the grim task of recovering bodies. Forty-five deaths have been confirmed, but that number is expected to rise in coming days.

At least 200,000 homes have been damaged, the Texas Department of Public Safety reported Sunday, with more than 12,750 destroyed. But those numbers also are certain to increase because the estimate excluded areas that officials have not been able to reach. More than 457,000 people have registered so far for disaster assistance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Houston school officials, surveying some buildings for the first time since the hurricane hit last weekend, were stunned by what they encountered.

The storm damaged nearly half of all public schools here, part of the nation's seventh-largest education system, and more than 75 campuses will require major cleanups or repairs that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, officials said. As of Saturday, the damage to 40 district schools had not even been assessed because they still had several feet of water in their classrooms, cafeterias and auditoriums.

""It's not just an assessment of whether they are dry or they're wet,"" said Schools Superintendent Richard Carranza. Workers are trying to check for structural damage, air quality, mold, the integrity of pipes and whether computers and other equipment still work.

That process will take months, but Carranza said he wants to get teachers into as many schools as possible by Friday, with the system's 218,000 students to follow on Sept. 11. The school year had been scheduled to officially start last Monday, when Harvey was pummeling the city with what ultimately was measured as 50 inches of rain.

Officials are considering several scenarios, including consolidating multiple schools onto one campus, mapping creative busing routes and possibly dividing the school day and assigning different groups of students to morning and afternoon sessions.

President Trump and the first lady visited Houston on Saturday, stopping at one of its biggest emergency shelters to talk with storm victims. In public comments, he highlighted the toll on families while also recognizing the relief efforts and praising the way his administration was handling the disaster.

[Trump returns to flood-ravaged Texas, this time to try out role of 'consoler-in-chief']

""We saw a lot of happiness,"" Trump said after meeting evacuees in the NRG Center. ""It's been really nice. It's been a wonderful thing. As tough as this was, it's been a wonderful thing, I think even for the country to watch it, for the world to watch.""

Throughout the state's Gulf Coast, residents and officials spent Saturday in an awkward kind of limbo, drumming up optimism for the difficult recovery ahead even as they acknowledged other potential dangers.

Many of the Houston area's Superfund sites -- locations designated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency as the country's most intensely polluted places -- were flooded. Of those, 11 remain so overrun that authorities have not been able to assess the damage and potential toxic hazards, EPA officials said Saturday.

The Associated Press reported that water from an overflowing river had poured so hard through one site -- where the soil contains dioxins and other contaminants linked to birth defects and cancer -- that it badly damaged a nearby interstate highway bridge.

Fetid waters greeted many people as they returned to their homes. According to authorities in Humble, north of Houston, one resident found that a new occupant had moved in: a large alligator, lurking under the dining room table.

Another survivor, Tom Cullen, finally got a first look at his parents' house in West Houston.

It was almost a week ago that he had rushed to rescue them as their back yard filled. He borrowed a kayak from a neighbor and piled his mother, 81, and father, 88, in and paddled them to safety.

On Saturday morning, friends passing by the house sent him photos. The pictures showed it was still under almost seven feet of muddy water. Every family photograph, the sofas they used sit on for family movie nights, the kitchen where they used to eat together -- all still submerged.

""That house is a landmark of memories for all our family,"" he said. ""It is a total devastation that will be with me until the end of days.""

In East Houston, where floodwaters remained as high as four feet in many areas, school officials allowed reporters to tour one building.

Even before the storm, A.G. Hilliard Elementary was facing challenges. The school is in one of the most impoverished communities in the city.

It now confronts a gargantuan challenge, with water pooled around chairs and computers and black-and-white composition books soaked through and strewn all over classroom floors. The entire school smelled rancid and damp on Saturday. A thin layer of dirt covered the floors like brown powdered sugar. Even the blue painted paw prints of the school's mascot at the front entrance were smeared.

The devastation inflicted by Harvey will require workers to tear up the entire vinyl flooring, cut away up to four feet off the walls and apply an antimicrobial treatment to everything, officials explained. Lockers will have to be pulled out, as well as the gym's padded floors.

Rhonda Skillern-Jones, a board of education trustee, broke down in tears as she walked the hallways.

In 2013, the Houston district absorbed the schools in the community into its system after the state shut them down for poor academic performance, financial troubles and mismanagement.

""The kids were pretty far behind on the learning curve. We made a lot of progress with them over time, catching them up and getting them on grade level,"" said Skillern-Jones, who is a mother of five. ""I'm just afraid that this is such a setback for them educationally.""

On her way to the school Saturday morning, she had driven past neighborhood homes where families were pulling out flooring, sheet rock and furniture. She is already worrying that students will have a hard time focusing on learning with their home lives in shambles. The district will have to deal with that trauma before turning its attention back to academics, she said.

For many of the children here, Skillern-Jones explained, Hilliard is one of the few pillars of stability in their lives. ""It's going to take a lot of people pulling together to support these babies.""

148,148,"It's back-to-school season. Parents mark their youngsters' height on the wall and marvel at how much they've grown - but what's going on just below the pencil line in that child's brain?

We know brain development continues from infancy to adulthood, but many parents underestimate how much a child's brain changes from year to year, and how those changes can influence behaviour.

Decades of scientific studies have shown even an immature brain is capable of extraordinary feats. Yet a fully developed brain is necessary for actions that adults take for granted, such as risk assessment and self-control.

According to developmental psychologists, parents who better understand the stages along the way can help guide their child over the hurdles.

Babies, for example, are surprisingly good at communicating.

They are looking, listening and imitating from the time they are born. Stick your tongue out at a baby, even an infant just hours old, and he or she may do the same back at you, said Sarah Lytle of the Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences at the University of Washington.

Yet many parents don't realise how quickly infants begin to develop social and emotional awareness, said Ross Thompson, who is president of the child development organisation Zero to Three, and a cognitive psychologist at the University of California at Davis.

""Parents underestimate how sensitive a child is to their emotions,"" he said. As early as six months old, a child can be affected by a parent's depression or anxiety, and by marital squabbles.

Babies also look to their parents for guidance in uncertain situations. If you're on a subway and start interacting with the little one next to you, the baby may turn to the parent to see how to respond to you.

This process is called ""social cognition"" or ""social referencing"", and it's not so different from when adults at a party wait to respond to a joke when they're unsure whether others will find it funny or offensive.

To help infants learn, Lytle suggests that parents should frequently look at what they're talking about, and change their gaze slowly. This important social cue helps with language development, she said - with babies who follow gazes closely having a more diverse vocabulary by the time they're two.

All languages sound the same initially to a newborn, and then a tuning process begins. By about 10 months, babies start to specialise in the language they're used to hearing.

It's important to talk to your child during the first year, especially using ""parentese"", Lytle said. This infant-directed speech is not ""baby-talking"", despite its typical singsong tone and repetition, but uses real words in grammatically complete sentences.

While we typically underestimate babies' ability to understand and communicate before they begin speaking, we tend to overestimate the brain power of walking, talking toddlers.

Toddlers are seemingly mentally incapable of sharing and self-control. In a survey conducted by Zero to Three in 2015, nearly half of parents believed their children could learn to share by the time they are two.

But according to the cognitive psychologists at Zero to Three, this skill does not typically develop until a child is three or four. That may be because they haven't yet developed what's known as ""theory of mind"".

Theory of mind is the ability to differentiate one's own perspective and preferences from someone else. A classic experiment in theory of mind is known as the ""Sally-Anne test"". A child is told Sally has a basket and Anne has a box. Sally puts an object in her basket, then leaves. While Sally is gone, Anne moves the object to the box.

The child is then asked where Sally will look for the object when she returns. Correctly answering that Sally will look in her basket signals the child understands they have a perspective that is different from Sally's.

Theory of mind is important for developing empathy, making friends and even doing well academically, Lytle says. Parents can help their children develop perspective by talking them through scenarios like the Sally-Anne test, or reading books that help them to build cognitive parallels. For example, in a book where a character goes to a doctor, they can compare the situation to when the child went to the doctor and discuss how the experiences were similar or different.

According to that 2015 survey, the majority of parents also believed two-year-olds can control their emotions and impulses. Yet children have very limited self-control abilities until they are about four. When toddlers won't stop throwing a fit, do something forbidden or refuse to share, Thompson explains that they're not being willfully obstinate: ""Many parents overestimate a child's capacity for self-control.""

Thompson recommends helping young children with self-control - for example, by distracting them with a favourite toy while passing candy in the grocery store checkout aisle. And when dealing with a tantrum, acknowledge a child's feelings by putting them into words. ""A lot of their frustration is the feeling of being misunderstood,"" he noted.

He also suggests giving the child the impression that they have some control. In his own case, when his young son didn't want to go to bed, Thompson would ask the boy whether he wanted to play for a few more minutes.

Yes, a distinguished professor in psychology was on his knees, negotiating with a three-year-old, but Thompson says parents who understand how their toddlers' brains work (or don't work) will find it fairly easy to outsmart them. It's good to tell a child ""no"" because they're learning language, he added, but you can't expect them to change their behaviours.

Teenagers don't think with the same parts of their brain as adults.

For some parents, a seemingly erratic teenager can make those long-ago toddler days seem like a walk in the park. Frances Jensen, neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of The Teenage Brain suggests understanding how teens think can improve the experience for both sides.

Connections in our brain develop from the back to the front, and those important for higher-order thinking continue to form and strengthen into a person's twenties. ""Teenagers have good connectivity up to about their ears,"" Jensen explained. And at this age, the midbrain - important for emotion - sexual function, learning and memory, is hyperactive.

As teens transition into adulthood, connections in the front of their brain are strengthened, while those in the other regions are pruned. A fully developed frontal lobe is essential for planning, decision-making, impulse control and risk avoidance.

These stages of development showed up in a 2006 imaging experiment. Researchers discovered adults trying to identify fearful facial expressions used more of the front of their brain, while teens used the emotional centres in the midbrain - meaning teens literally think using different parts of their brain.

The finding might explain why some teen behaviours surprise adults. ""Teenagers are actually more susceptible to stress,"" Jensen said. If your teen comes home distraught because someone made fun of their hair, you might be tempted to say it's no big deal. But the activity in their brain likely resembles an adult brain's response to news of a major international incident.

The plasticity of teen brains - their ability to lose, form and strengthen connections - also makes adolescents especially susceptible to addiction, to everything from video games to cocaine, Jensen said. Activities such as binge drinking and chronic marijuana use can be especially damaging at this age.

Jensen recommends giving teens a ""frontal-lobe assist"" by helping them to plan, prepare and even rehearse for situations that require higher judgement. Help them develop and learn phrases to use as excuses to avoid making a bad decision amid social pressure, for example. And if they do make a bad decision, she suggests using the situation as a teachable moment instead of lecturing or alienating them.

Throughout a child's life, parents who understand some basics of brain development can adjust their expectations, and better come up with strategies to prevent frustration for everyone.

In other words, a little understanding goes a long way.

149,149,"A local furniture-rental firm has partnered with Woodwynn Farms founder Richard Leblanc on a project to help fund the therapeutic facility.

An event-rental business has partnered with a therapeutic community to introduce altruism into its business model, producing a new kind of accountable commerce.

The Wise Co. has announced it will offer a collection of rental furniture designed and produced by the therapeutic community at Woodwynn Farms.

""I had often worked with people who were incredibly generous, and wanted to do good for their communities,"" said Niecia Dunn, CEO and founder. ""But due to the hastiness of [the] Western lifestyle, [they] lacked the network or ability to source the right target for the resources they had to offer.""

People can now support the farm through renting reasonably priced furniture produced by the farm's residents.

Half of all rental costs -- for the lifetime of the products -- will return to the 193-acre farm to fund the Believe in People program established by social pioneer Richard Leblanc.

The goal of the program is to raise $30,000 -- what it costs to sponsor a participant to live at the farm for a year.

The unveiling of the first piece of furniture from the new rental partnership line will take place at a four-course Fall Harvest Dinner, hosted by the Greater Victoria Chamber of Commerce, Sept. 7 at Woodwynn Farms, 7789 West Saanich Rd.

Cancer victim meets lifesaving blood donor

Donating blood saves lives. Last week, a Vancouver Island woman got to celebrate her 55th birthday -- and to meet the person whose blood donation made it possible.

Ann Radelet was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2003 and underwent three years of chemotherapy. By 2006, the cancer had returned and had transformed into a secondary cancer. The only hope left for her was a bone-marrow transplant.

Her doctor suggested they try a stem-cell transplant instead of a marrow transplant.

But they needed a donor.

The doctors look at antigens in the blood, which they rate out of 10. They tested Radelet's two siblings, but found only a five-out-of-10 match, which was not good enough. So they went further afield, looking for donors in a worldwide registry.

Just as she was undergoing her seventh round of chemotherapy, Radelet got the news that they found a nine-out-of-10 match, which translates into a 70 per cent success rate.

She received the donated stem cells in February 2007.

She has been cancer-free since then.

Donors are protected by privacy regulations. Radelet was told she would have to wait two years before she could inquire about the donor -- and only if the donor would allow it.

She eventually found out the donor was a woman named Nicole from Duisburg, Germany. The two corresponded and have talked frequently since then.

When Nicole and Radelet spoke for the first time, they said: ""We are blood sisters,"" and that name has stuck for the pair.

In August, Nicole and her sister (an eight-out-of-10 match) visited Vancouver Island for their first meeting in person.

""We are all so very excited. I can't ever thank her enough, but I will honour her any way I can,"" said Radelet. ""I am so grateful for the team at Vancouver General Hospital and the Canadian Blood Services. They save so many lives in more ways than one.

""I am forever eternally grateful to Nicki; she donated blood and stem cells and saved my life. Thank you to all the blood donors out there. I needed lots of it during all my chemotherapy.

""My family is still whole. My mother still has her daughter, my brothers still have their sister, my children still have their mom, my husband still has his wife, and now I am a grandma to three adorable babies. I am the most fortunate woman in the world.""

Canadian Blood Services maintains the OneMatch Stem Cell and Marrow Network. It is responsible for finding and matching volunteer donors to patients who require stem-cell transplants.

Need2 runs suicide-prevention programs

Need2 Suicide Prevention and Education Support is hosting a public gathering to mark World Suicide Prevention Day, Sunday, Sept. 10 in Centennial Square.

This marks the 15th year of the event. The gathering aims to bring awareness to the efforts to prevent deaths by suicide and the devastating effects of suicide.

The gathering is an open forum where everyone can share. Educational information will be available, along with Need2 support staff.

Suicide is difficult to talk about. It is emotionally charged and carries a great deal of associated shame and stigma.

When persons who are feeling suicidal try to talk about their feelings of desperation, hopelessness and alienation, there is often no one who can really hear their pain.

Need2 provides assistance (urgent or general), runs suicide-prevention programs, puts on workshops and provides information.

The event runs 2 to 4 p.m. Sept. 10 in Centennial Square. For more information, go to need2.ca.

Cycle tour raises funds for hospice

Kane Mercer has just completed a cycle tour across Canada in memory of his father and to raise awareness and funds for Victoria Hospice and palliative care.

""Like life, long journeys can be challenging and full of unexpected difficulties,"" said Mercer. ""But through a positive attitude, support from friendly people and a consistent effort, these hurdles can be overcome.""

In honour of the fifth year since his passing, Mercer is keeping the memory of his father alive with this epic cycling tour across Canada called Ride for Rand.

""I decided to make this ride in support of Victoria Hospice in acknowledgment of the support they gave my father and my family,"" he said. ""Hospice is a chronically underfunded and neglected area, which I feel deserves attention.""

Donations fund almost half of Victoria Hospice's annual operating costs. Funds enable it to provide the best possible end-of-life care. For more information, or to donate, go to victoriahospice.org.

Seniors program seeks volunteers

Seniors Serving Seniors is recruiting volunteers for its Return to Health Program, as well as candidates for its October training session.

Training for volunteers, funded by the United Way of Greater Victoria, consists of a comprehensive course on seniors' concerns and services.

Graduates also attend monthly, two-hour support meetings throughout the year.

Return to Health volunteers provide companionship and social support for frail seniors returning home after a hospital stay.

Volunteers visit clients and offer assistance to help them connect to services and regain self-confidence. The goal of the program is to assist clients in finding practical services they might need following hospitalization, re-socializing and making new friends at seniors' social programs in the area.

Training includes: Effective communication skills, nutrition, the effects of disease on normal aging, navigating the health-care system, and how to get access to community programs.

Training for new volunteers takes place from 1 to 4 p.m. every Thursday over five weeks beginning on Oct. 19.

Please call the Return to Health education co-ordinator, Donna Ross, at 250-655-1327 to register for the information session on Oct. 12.

Exhibition shows contemporary artists

Deconstructing Comfort, an interdisciplinary arts exhibition presenting the work of seven contemporary Indigenous artists and artists of colour, opens Friday at Open Space.

Artists include Léuli Eshraghi, Jamelie Hassan, Syrus Marcus Ware, Lisa Myers, Nadia Myre, Haruko Okano and Philip Kevin Paul.

The exhibition co-curators, Michelle Jacques, Doug Jarvis and France Trépanier, examine: Decolonization and Indigenization; issues raised by Black Lives Matter; calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission; Islamophobia; unsettling settlers; and Canada 150 celebrations.

Deconstructing Comfort runs to Oct. 14. A public reception will take place on Sept. 25 as part of the public program for the Primary Colours/Couleurs primaires gathering.

This three-year initiative seeks to place Indigenous art practices at the centre of the Canadian art system. It also asserts that art practices by people of colour, which have roots around the world, play a critical role in any discussion that imagines Canada's future.

The initiative includes a major multidisciplinary, trilingual -- Lekwungen, French and English -- gathering at the Songhees Wellness Centre, on Lekwungen territories.

Japanese-Canadians remember internment

More than a dozen survivors of Japanese-Canadian internment during the Second World War will speak of their experiences at a luncheon commemorating the 75th anniversary of the saga, Sept. 10.

The Victoria Nikkei Cultural Society is hosting the event, which tells the tragedy of the relocation and internment of Japanese-Canadians during the conflict.

""Because it's so hard to imagine this happening today, it's critical that all Canadians -- whether they have Japanese heritage or not -- remember what happened with the internments during the Second World War,"" said Tsugio Kurushima, president of the society. ""We are fortunate to still have first-hand witnesses who can share their stories with the generations who followed them.""

From 1942 until 1949 (four years after the end of the war), Japanese-Canadians living in coastal British Columbia were detained by the government. They were relocated to camps and farms in the Interior and in the rest of Canada, restricted in their movement and stripped of their businesses and homes.

To add insult to injury, the sale of their personal property was used to fund the internments.

""People who never committed a crime were treated like criminals simply because of their heritage,"" said Kurushima. ""It's a wrong the Canadian government apologized for in 1988, along with the launch of a redress program.""

There will also be a presentation by Jordan Stanger-Ross, director of the Landscapes of Injustice project, housed at the University of Victoria.

He will give an update on the project, which explores the forced dispossession of Japanese-Canadians.

The event includes a buffet lunch with two hot entrées, including a vegetarian lasagna option.

Tickets are $15 adults, $7.50 for children 5 to 12. The event runs 1 to 4:30 p.m. Sept. 10 at the Ambrosia Event Centre, 638 Fisgard St.

Tickets available from Patti Ayukawa, Real English Victoria, #301 -- 1111 Blanshard St. or 250-858-8445. For more information, go to vncs.ca."
150,150,"WITH bilateral relations between Guyana and Cuba deepening, Guyana's Ambassador to Cuba Ambassador Halim Majeed believes that the two countries are well poised to benefit through economic diplomacy.

In an interview with the Guyana Chronicle, Ambassador Majeed revealed that special attention has been paid to initiating and enhancing development programmes, in keeping with the country's national mandate.

As such, since assuming the role of Ambassador in March 2016, he sought assistance of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce to formally invite several private-sector business entities to visit Cuba so as to understand the existing opportunities.

The Ambassador said while some, such as Gafsons Industries Limited, Nand Persaud & Company Limited, Distribution Services Limited (DSL), W & T George and Company, and Bulkan Timber Works (BTW), among others, have demonstrated an interest in trade and commercial relations, others such as CSR Computers/APERTA Limited and Modern Industries Limited have shown a preference for joint-venture arrangements with Cuban state companies.

""I should mention that BTW has met several Cuban companies during their recent one-week visit to Cuba and is in the process of looking at best practices on exporting to Cuba. At the same time, DSL is negotiating how best it could capitalise on its engagement with a number of Cuban pharmaceutical companies (including manufacturers of cancer vaccines, cancer kits, diabetic vaccines and upscale pharmaceuticals) and SUCHEL, Cuba's leading manufacturer in men and women beauty products,"" said Ambassador Majeed.

Recently, it was announced by the Guyana Government that Cuba has expressed an interest in importing Guyana's rice and for the first time in 40 years, some 15,000 metric tonnes of rice will be exported by Guyana. It is expected that come next year between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes of rice will be exported to Cuba.

""In my discussions with both the Guyanese and Cuban sides, it is very probable that Guyana could capture a much larger share of the Cuban rice market,"" said Majeed. But Guyana and Cuba have cooperated on a number of other fronts. In January, the Guyana Foundation whose Founder and President is Ms. Supriya Singh-Bodden, CCH, and the University of Medical Sciences of Ciego de Avila, convened the first International Conference on Mental Health, Drug Abuse, Suicide and Domestic Violence in Cuba.

That conference' the Ambassador told the Guyana Chronicle, had much publicity not only in Cuba, but also internationally. He disclosed that because of its success, a second conference is being planned and will see Singh-Bodden visiting Cuba soon to meet with the Rector of the University of Medical Sciences of Ciego de Avila.

Cuba is widely known for its medical training programmes and Guyana has benefitted tremendously from those since 1976. In fact, by September 2017, we will have a total of 62 students in Cuba. Of that number, 21 will be post-graduate students specialising in dermatology, pathology, neurology, gynaecology, orthopaedics and cardiology, among other specialisations.

Both undergraduate and post-graduate students will be located at various Universities of Medical Sciences across Cuba. For example, in the province of Havana, there will be 29 students; in the province of Sancti Spiritus, there will be 11 students; in the province of Pinar del Rio, there will be eight students, and in Santiago de Cuba, there will be 10, said Ambassador Majeed.

This year, 37 Guyanese students who studied in Cuba completed their Sixth Year (medical internships) in Guyana and are now full-fledged medical professionals. However, it should be noted that more emphasis was being placed on post-graduate programmes there.

Meanwhile, the recent air transportation agreement will also see tremendous opportunities opening for both countries. For the first time, a Guyanese company, Fly Jamaica, will be flying non-stop from Cuba to Guyana. That inaugural flight is expected to be at the end of this month.

In June, Fly Jamaica's Managing-Director, Roxanne Reece, told the Guyana Chronicle on the sidelines of the opening of the company's second ticketing office in Brooklyn, New York, that the company believes in Guyana and alluded to the hundreds of Cuban nationals who travel here weekly to purchase goods, bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economy.

They seek mainly clothing and electrical items and fly mostly with Easy Skies to Guyana.

""We have everything ready,"" Reece told the newspaper, adding: ""We have captains, co-pilots, cabin crew. Everything is ready. We are just waiting on one of the governments to give us the word to go.""

Ambassador Majeed also alluded to the areas of trade, investment and other forms of economic cooperation which he described as ""of profound significance in our bilateral relations.""

""It is anticipated that two important agreements will be executed in the near future. One is the Trade Memorandum between the Cuban Ministry of External Affairs (MINREX) and my Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The other is between the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) and the Cuban Chamber of Commerce.

""This is the first such agreement between the two Chambers...the Cuban Government takes a very formal and legal approach on those matters,"" he told the Chronicle.

Additionally, Ambassador Majeed said the Cuban Chamber of Commerce had been informed that President of the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce, Deodat Indar, will travel to Cuba on the occasion of the 35th Havana International Trade Fair (FIHAV) to be held from October 31 to November 5, for the signing of the agreement. Last year, Minister of Business, Dominic Gaskin, attended the Trade Fair and met with, among other persons, Roderigo Malmierca, the Cuban Minister of Foreign Trade and Investment. Guyana is slated to participate again this year.

Meanwhile, another significant agreement between the two states, Ambassador Majeed alluded to, is the Promotion and Protection of Investments Agreement. He told the Chronicle that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently examining the agreement seriously, and noted too, that the agreement was signed in 2002.

""We may have to re-negotiate that agreement rather than drafting a completely new one. I have remarked on this agreement because, as I pointed out previously, a number of Guyanese companies have shown more than a passing interest in investing in Cuba. For example, Nand Persaud & Company Limited has been in preliminary discussions with the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade and Investment about establishing a rice-milling plant and a fertiliser blending plant in Port Mariel,"" the Ambassador added.

Ambassador Majeed has acknowledged concerns over what many have described as co-operation between Guyana and ""a problematic Cuba,"" but noted that some 45 years ago it was former President Linden Forbes Sampson Burnham who, despite opposition, ""almost single- handedly broke the economic blockade against Cuba.""

""And so, when others see Cuba as a small island of recurrent problems, we look at Cuba as a vast ocean of endless opportunities,"" said the Guyanese Ambassador, who noted that next year Guyana will be deepening its political and economic relations with Cuba.

""My ministry is not oblivious to the economic benefits of the US$ 1.8 billion Cuban agricultural market, nor are we ignorant of the advantages that could accrue to the national interest by collaborating with Cuba in the tourism sector,"" said Guyana's Ambassador to Cuba.

Guyana, he said, is set on a path of development for its people. ""My ministry, I believe, is playing its own unique role in securing a worthwhile future for all of our citizens,"" the Ambassador concluded."

A schoolboy has been sentenced to four years in custody after he set off a homemade bomb in a Sainsbury's supermarket.

The 16-year-old, who has not been named, wedged the explosive into a toilet at the store in Blackheath near Birmingham.

Woman arrested after video of Muslims 'being racially abused' is posted online

He had made the device at home following step-by-step instructions he had found online.

Sentencing yesterday, Judge James Burbidge QC said that the boy did not follow any extremist groups and is 'not a terrorist'.

He said: 'This was not a random act but a prepared act. You did not intentionally want to cause harm but it was such a highly reckless act that it was fortunate people were not caused harm.'

According to the Express and Star, the boy wore a bandana and covered the lower part of his face and nose when he entered the supermarket on May 27.

He then went into the toilets, where he placed the bomb into a cubicle.

Tablet 'stuck in juice carton' left little boy 'screaming in pain'

The court heard that he later crouched over a cleaner with a blade in a bid to warn her away after she spotted him the the toilet.

She ran and raised the alarm with other colleagues after spotting smoke rising from the toilet bowl.

The teenager then fled the scene, ripping off his disguise in a bid to blend in with shoppers - who were being evacuated by staff.

Armed police were called to the scene and the area was cordoned off.

The schoolboy was later arrested and reportedly told police her had spent a month visiting anarchist websites in a bid to learn how to make a bomb.

He said he had not been forced to make it, but could not explain why he targeted the supermarket.

The court heard that the explosion caused more than £1,000 worth of damage to the store, which also lost £110,000 in revenue as a result of being closed for the day.

Defence barrister Mr Andrew Jackson said: 'This whole dreadful episode appears to be motivated by a combination or curiosity, and almost addiction, to computers, and frankly wanting to see what would happen.'

The 16-year-old pleaded guilty to making an explosive substance for unlawful purposes and doing an act with intent to cause explosion likely to endanger life or injure property.

He also admitted possession of a bladed article in a public place.

The schoolboy was sentenced to four years and four months in custody."
152,152,"San Francisco - Legendary Apple chief Steve Jobs stepped aside on a high note as the company he saved from ruin raked in a blockbuster $6-billion profit amid unrelenting demand for iPhones and iPads.

A day after Jobs announced he was taking an indefinite leave of absence for medical reasons, Apple reported its record net profit as revenue soared to an unprecedented $26.74 billion in the quarter ending December 31.

The Cupertino, California-based company said it sold 7.33 million iPad tablet computers and 16.24 million iPhones.

""We had a phenomenal holiday quarter with record Mac, iPhone and iPad sales,"" Jobs said in a statement accompanying the earnings report.

""We are firing on all cylinders and we've got some exciting things in the pipeline for this year including iPhone 4 on Verizon, which customers can't wait to get their hands on.""

He chose Monday, a US holiday on which stock markets were closed, to announce that he was turning the Apple helm over to chief operating officer Timothy Cook.

Jobs will keep his chief executive title and participate in ""major strategic decisions"" at Apple.

Apple shares fell on Tuesday as concerns for Jobs health raised questions about the company's future.

Record high quarterly earnings figures and assurances by Cook that the company saw boom times ahead with its coveted gadgets helped the stock recover some ground.

Apple shares rose slightly more than a percent to $344.90 (about R2400) a share in trading that followed the earnings release but remained down in price for the day, after closing at a record high of $348.48 in New York on Friday.

The company is ""working around the clock"" to increase the supply of its hot-selling iPhones, and has already seen more than 80 percent of major companies begin letting workers use iPad tablet computers for business, Cook said.

Apple revenue soared 67 percent in the Asia Pacific market, with the company taking in $2.6 billion dollars in China in the quarter, he added.

In announcing he was going on medical leave, his third since 2004, the 55-year-old Jobs did not say how long he expected to be away or provide any details about his latest health issues.

Jobs underwent an operation for pancreatic cancer in 2004 and received a liver transplant in early 2009. He has appeared gaunt but relatively healthy at recent Apple public events.

Cook, 50, has filled in for Jobs in the past, with Apple thriving.

He is part of a powerful team of executives stepping in to fill the shoes of Jobs, the charismatic heart and soul of Apple who some believe is irreplaceable.

""At the end of the day, there is more to Apple than Steve,"" said analyst Michael Gartenberg, a partner at Altimeter Group.

""These are all people who have been trained by Steve, worked closely with Steve and are the embodiment of Apple's core culture.""

Analyst Rob Enderle of Silicon Valley's Enderle Group said Jobs's absence will be felt on strategic questions such as ""what will Apple do next?""

""The challenge is what comes after the iPad,"" Enderle said.

""Apple without Steve Jobs didn't have the magic,"" he said of the previous occasions when Jobs stepped aside for health reasons. ""It was lacking this little something.""

Product plans are typically mapped out two years in advance, so possible launches of successors to the iPhone and iPad later this year would not change with Jobs absent.

As chief operating officer, Cook has been in charge of end-to-end management of Apple's supply chain, sales, service and support in all countries.

""Cook is the person who makes the trains run on time at Apple,"" Gartenberg said.

Apple's fortunes have been uniquely linked to Jobs, who returned to the then flagging company in 1997 after a 12-year absence and introduced innovative and wildly successful products like the iPod, iPhone and iPad.

Apple has sold approximately 14.79 million iPads since the tablet computers hit the market in April, according to a tally of figures made public in earnings releases.

""I have great confidence that Tim and the rest of the executive management team will do a terrific job executing the exciting plans we have in place for 2011,"" Jobs said. - AFP"
153,153,"In 2013, the United States ceded the supercomputing crown to China, whose Sunway TaihuLight machine is over five times as powerful as the U.S. government's fastest system, called Titan. But the Department of Energy is working on a new generation of supercomputers that are 50 times faster than Titan -- a performance boost described as ""exascale."" Today, DoE awarded $258 million in contracts to six U.S. companies -- AMD, Cray (maker of Titan), Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Intel, and Nvidia -- to build an exascale system by 2021. The companies themselves are expected to add at least $172 million of their own funding to the project, since they will also benefit from the new technologies developed.

Technological contributions to the Exascale Computing Project will vary. In the first phase, companies will be designing technologies that could potentially be used in a future system, says Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). It will be pushing a new computer architecture that keeps data in monstrous amounts of superfast RAM where it can be worked on all at once, rather than shuttling it to and from slower hard drives. This pool of data will be a ""fabric"" linking processors that work on the data. HPE introduced a prototype of this technology, called The Machine last month.

That memory-oriented approach seems to jibe with IBM's philosophy. ""High performance computing is shifting from a purely compute-centric model to one that is much more data-centric,"" writes James Sexton of IBM Research in an email to Fast Company. ""The ability to manage, train, sort and analyze the data 'where it resides' and 'as it flows' through the system is critical to gaining insight quickly from the plethora of data sources vs. traditional [computing methods].""

Nvidia's contribution will be more-powerful graphics processing units for artificial intelligence -- a generation or more beyond the new Volta chips going into DoE computers already slated for 2018. Beyond the hardware, DoE is also charging the companies to write powerful software to run the monstrous calculations.

You'd be forgiven for not grasping what the performance goal of 1,000 petaflop/s (quadrillions of calculations per second) means for real-world applications. DoE lists plenty of potential examples, such as simulating the effects of earthquakes, predicting the effectiveness of cancer treatments, designing nuclear fusion reactors, and modeling the aerodynamics of giant wind farms. An April 2017 DoE presentation on phenomena that the system can model even includes the words ""climate change"" -- once in a 30-page document.

One of the Exascale Computing Project's green goals is to boost performance without requiring more energy. But even if DoE succeeds, it will still have a pretty high electric bill. The best-case scenario is a system that consumes 20 megawatts, enough to power about 20,000 homes."
154,154,"There've been a lot of references the past couple of months to the childhood tale of Pinocchio, whose nose grew when he lied, or the schoolyard chant of ""Liar, liar, pants on fire."" Our political landscape is rife with charges and countercharges of lying.

Yet Jeff Hancock says it's important to remember that most of the time, people do tell the truth.

Honest.

Hancock, founding director of the Stanford Social Media Lab, is known for his research into lying, and the effect (a positive one!) of technology and social media on honesty. We spoke to him about how we evolved to believe others, social media's impact on lying and how we've Ubered ourselves into new forms of trusting.

Q: Are we hard-wired to lie? Is it a natural human trait?

A: Actually, I think we're hard-wired to trust. We have what's called ""truth bias,"" which means that we tend to believe other people -- and there are cognitive, philosophical reasons that that's the case.

If you and I were standing in a field and you said, ""There's a lion behind you,"" if I have a truth bias, I will believe you. From an evolutionary bias, that's good, because if I don't believe you and you're telling the truth, I'm dead. If you are lying, I may look bad because you fooled me, but I'm alive.

The point here is that a lot of work shows that our first instinct is to trust other people. Then, sometimes, we may become suspicious.

Q: But everyone seems to be more skeptical these days.

A: Since 1972, the General Social Survey has been asking: Can people be trusted? And the rate has been decreasing over time. [Between 1972 and 2016, the share of adults who think that most people can be trusted fell from 46 percent to 31 percent.] People suspect social media of playing a role because there's been a massive increase in its use. But its effect actually is the opposite.

Q: How so? You'd think its impersonal nature would make it easier to lie.

A: With people we know, technology does not lead us to a rampant increase in deception because that would damage relationships. Besides, computers and such also leave records of everything, and that's really bad if they show that you're lying.

It's different with hostile foreign governments or scammers. They're using people we don't know to lie and create fake news and fake personas and bots. Now, say, I hear a story from Kim. I believe it because I know Kim and trust Kim. But Kim's been fooled, and I don't know that.

It's almost like a biological model of a virus. Cancer tricks a cancer cell into thinking that replicating itself is the right thing to do for the body. The analogy is introducing a fake story to people who think they're doing the right thing by spreading it.

Q: The job of fact-checking is important these days. Can there really be alternative facts? Or dueling lies?

A: It's massively challenging. When it comes to opinions, you can see how things can be ambiguous. What is a fact and is not a fact has led to the hyperpolarization we see.

Here's an example: I believe in climate change and the scientists who say it's caused by human activity. But I didn't do any actual research, and may even have a hard time understanding it. And the people who say they don't believe in it, they're making judgments the same way I am.

It's important to understand that we're not perfectly rational machines trying to comprehend the world in a purely objective way. We understand the world within a set of belief systems.

Q: So what is the future of lying, given our current preoccupation?

A: I think the danger is that we think everyone's lying all the time. As a society, we're grappling: How do I determine whether the knowledge I have about the world is valid or not? But we've been concerned about this for centuries.

Quite honestly, another aspect is that the president is very focused on lying. He talks about other people being liars and he says things that contradict himself. (In Trump's 1987 book, ""The Art of the Deal"") , he's been very upfront about this, saying that he's a salesman. He tells the ""truth with hyperbole.""

What's different from past presidents is that he far more frequently accuses other people of lying.

Q: So how can we better realize that something we believe is a lie?

A: It's actually very difficult to change a belief because emotionally, psychologically, we don't want to be wrong. But it's important to remember that most of the time, we are being told the truth.

There are costs to being duped, to being taken for money or scammed. But there also are costs of being paranoid and cynical. It undermines relationships. We're less likely to feel connected to society. There are huge benefits to being trusting and we need to think about ways to restore trust in institutions.

Look at what's happening with Airbnb and Uber, letting people into our homes and our cars. We're trusting each other in all sorts of new ways. If you ask people about their thoughts, they say they can't trust anyone. But looking at behavior tells us another story."

156,156,"Mosto Onuoha, University of Nigeria's Professor of Geology, is the current President of the 40-year-old Nigerian Academy of Science - the foremost independent scientific body dedicated to the development and advancement of science, technology and innovation (STI) in Nigeria.

In this interview with OJIAKU KALU, following the 2017 inductions of new fellows of the Academy, he speaks of ways Nigeria benefits from the activities of his scholarly body and how the nation could maximise the benefits of STI for sustainable development.

Nine scholars, including a female, were inducted last May as fellows of your Academy. How are fellows selected?

Our Academy, just as any other the world over, is quite conservative with its membership admission tradition. In fact, with regards to the Nigerian Academy of Science, no singular scientist can approach the Academy directly for membership talks. What is normal is that a prospective applicant would comply within the time frame provided annually by the Academy, which always opens on June 1 and closes on July 31. An interested applicant approaches an existing fellow with his/her CV and a description of work so far - to indicate his/her interest in becoming a fellow of the Academy. That particular fellow would then nominate the prospective individual, and must be seconded by another fellow. Then, such application would be referred to the Selection Committee that would collate the bulk of applications and eliminate as appropriate.

The selection committee would refer each of the applications to any of the Specialist Committees (there are 10 specialist committees in all) depending on the field of each applicant. The sub-committees would refer its recommendation to the Council for final approval and endorsement. The Academy does not admit more than 10 applicants in each given year. There could be as many applications as possible, but not more than 10 are approved and eventually inducted - after several eliminations.

The topic of the 2017 public lecture was Cancer: Keeping the Monster at Bay. What informs the lecturer and choice of topic for each year?

Speaker for the annual public lecture is voluntary, though the Academy sometimes tries to encourage fellows to take up the challenge - especially those among us that have not spoken before. Upon accepting the task, he/she is at liberty to choose any topic within his specialisation to speak on; but such a topic is expected to address a subsisting problem in society by attempting to provide solutions on it.

Why was the Nigerian Academy of Science formed in the first place?

To start with, the Nigerian Academy of Science is a body made up of most of Nigeria's foremost scientists. It is the highest scientific honours society in Nigeria. The members are called fellows; and are people who are globally acknowledged in their fields of science, engineering and technology. The Academy itself is 40 years old this year - having been formed in 1977. It started when some eminent members of the Science Association of Nigeria, mostly, very well-known professors and researchers who had also become fellows of the Science Association of Nigeria got together to form an Academy of Science, similar to academies, like the Royal Society in the United Kingdom, and other science academies in other parts of the world. Today, the Nigerian Academy of Science has relationships with many other academies in Africa, in the world and it represents the country at the International Council of Scientific Union (ICSU). One unique thing about academies, whether it is Academy of Science, Academy of Engineering, or Academy of Arts as the case may be, is that you don't just walk into any of them. There is a rigorous (almost restrictive) system of admission or entrance that ensures that only the very best and most qualified come in.

I believe that every new president of the Academy comes with his own creative agenda to advance the cause of the Academy. What values shall we be looking out for during your Presidency?

You know, the main vision of the Nigerian Academy of Science is an improved quality of life for the Nigerian society, through the promotion and application of science and technology. And our main mission is to see how we can strengthen the nation's ability to deliver the fruits of science and technology to our people. So for me personally, if you look at our country today, the problems facing us are many and my main focus as President is to see that the Academy continues to partner with the various governments (Federal, State and Local) and the private sector in solving some of these problems through the dissemination of sound scientific knowledge. We will continue with our various advocacy programmes, organising one forum or the other on identified areas of national need and providing evidence-based advice to influence policy formulation to improve the lives of our people. To underscore what I'm saying, let me provide information on some of the things that the Academy has done in the recent past.

Through our forum on evidence-based health policy making, we have provided vital information on reducing maternal and infant mortality in Nigeria. We also organised another forum that focused on the nation's preparedness to control the rising burden of non-communicable diseases in the country. We recently tackled the issue of how to use agriculture for improved nutrition of women and children in Nigeria. In the days ahead we will turn our attention to other pressing issues, e.g. waste management in our urban areas, water and sanitation in the cities, and other environmental issues, including desertification in the North and deforestation in the South where the woodlands are fast disappearing.

One of the very important things that the Academy is already pursuing under my Presidency is to try to obtain a charter from the National Assembly officially recognising the Nigerian Academy of Science as the official organ for the provision of evidence-based advice on science, technology and innovation to government. We are hopeful that the present (i.e. 8th National Assembly) will pass this bill - especially now that House of Representatives on its own has favoured the bill. In almost every country where there is an Academy of Science, there is usually an official bill passed to set it up or recognise it for the work it does to the nation. The National Academy of Germany is the oldest continuously existing science academy and it was established on January 1, 1652 and chartered by Emperor Leopold I of Germany in 1667. The Royal Society, in London, was founded on November 28, 1660 and received the Royal Charter on April 23, 1663, with the King of England designated as its founder. The current Patron is Her Majesty the Queen. Even the Ghanaian Academy of Arts & Science was chartered through a bill sent to parliament shortly after the country's independence from Britain by the then President, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah.

When John F. Kennedy was President of the United States of America and all of a sudden it looked like the Soviet Union had overtaken them in the space research race by sending a man (Yuri Gagarin) into orbit round the earth, Kennedy gathered the leading American scientists and demanded they work how America would put men not just into orbit round the earth, but land them on the moon - at any cost! This is the kind of things that nations do. They identify their major problems or issues that are of national importance and task their scientists to produce the solutions.

How much of your efforts contribute to government's policy thrust?

We have been quite successful in the past and some notable public policies have emanated from our evidence-based advice to government. The Nigerian Academy of Science has since its inception had a history of beneficial interaction with Government. Nigeria's first National Science and Technology Policy was formulated in1986 in the realisation of the fact that overall national development could only be sustained through the effective application of scientific and technological skills for the production of goods and services. The Policy was designed to create harmony in the quest for knowledge about the environment through R & D and the use of that knowledge to ensure a better quality of life for our people. The Academy was actively involved in the formulation of that policy.

The Academy has successfully cooperated with the Federal Government in producing a report on Science and Scientific Research Infrastructure submitted to the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) in 1992. That report identified those areas of Science and Technology practice in Nigeria whose immediate reorganisation or development would enhance the evolution of industrialization in the country. At the instance of government, we also made vital contributions in 1997 to the deliberations on the concept of long-term strategic planning (code-named Vision 2010) for achieving national self-reliance, economic strength and political stability.

The National Assembly once prohibited energy drinks from coming into the country as well as outlawing smoking in public places. However, energy drinks and public smoking are still with us. What is your Academy doing about the defiance?

See, the Academy cannot act as the police, especially when laws have been passed on public smoking and scientific evidence provided about the harmful effects of smoking. It is the duty of the Customs to check what goods come into the country and of agencies like NAFDAC to monitor the foods, medicines and drinks that are sold to Nigerians. The Academy cannot do much in these areas. If something is not going well in our society and we can provide evidence-based advice on how to tackle it, we do so. When new policies or laws are introduced and they are not obeyed, it becomes another Nigerian problem, a situation when laws are not obeyed. If energy drinks are outlawed but are still available in our shops, the Academy cannot be blamed!

The Nigerian Academy of Science belongs in the global science community. How would you rate Nigerian Academy in comparison with other academies, particularly in Africa?

I think we have done exceptionally well, taking into consideration the fact that we do not receive direct yearly funding from government as other academies do in other lands. Indeed, we are now mentoring some other academies, especially in South-Saharan Africa. The Academy in Ghana is older than ours, but we ran past them many years ago, thanks to our sheer number, creativity and linkage with the US National Science Academies. The Academy in South Africa is also doing well with a robust support from their government. All in all, academies all over the world operate a fairly uniform mandate. They try to see how science, technology and innovation can deliver a better living standard for their citizenry.

For instance, in Nigeria today the discussion or argument on genetically modified organisms (GMO) is on-going. The Academy has issued an official statement regarding the suitability of GMO-based foods to human health. We are going to say a lot more on this topic soon. The Nigerian Academy of Science has done very well, in my opinion. A lot more could be done if more funding is available for our activities.

What would you say is the greatest challenge to science and technology education in Nigeria?

The answer is money. The will is lacking on the part of the authorities to put in the money required. I was privileged to study in a European university on full scholarship for both my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and in my class in those day I was the only one who didn't know how to use a typewriter in my first year in the university. All my classmates (who were Europeans) had learned how to type in their secondary school years. Personal computers were then still unknown; most of my mates knew how to use typewriters to personally process their work. I couldn't use the typewriter because I hadn't been taught how to do so. In fact, the first typewriter that I ever saw back home was the one in the principal's office at my secondary school! But, my classmates in the university had gone through introductory technology, typewriting, and had other practical skills (like soldering and electrical wiring) before coming into the university.

Now in Nigeria, we have introduced these things into our 6-3-3-4 system of education, but in many secondary schools, there are no ""real"" Mathematics or Physics teachers and near empty Physics and Chemistry labs. Teachers with sufficient skills to teach introductory technology are also in short supply. We need trained science teachers who have to be motivated so that they can accept postings in schools in rural areas. Many university graduates are looking for jobs; but many of them available to teach science subjects are not being hired. Where there are teachers, there are no laboratories. Even in the universities, laboratory experiments that students are supposed to singly perform are now done in groups. Funds to buy reagents and many other necessities are not made available. The student population has grown and out of five to eight students performing one lab experiment, only two may be genuinely interested while the rest merely float or sleepwalk through the process. So there is the issue of motivation - which goes back to the question of lack of money to adequately compensate teachers, and lack of equipment - which is also due to funding. These are some of the glaring problems facing science education in our land today.

There is one more thing the Academy is working on that is very important and government has already recognised it. This is, perhaps, the only country where people studying for their MA/MSc or PhD degrees pay for their research largely from their own pockets. A PhD project is supposed to solve a problem - which means someone should already be waiting for the answer the researcher is going to provide. This presupposes that someone, or a research grant awarding body, should be available to provide funds for the work. Today, there are very few grant-awarding bodies in Nigeria to which people in R & D can turn for funds. TetFund and PTDF are perhaps the only exceptions."
157,157,"""Sitting is the new smoking,"" says James A. Levine, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Mayo Clinic-Arizona State University Obesity Solutions Initiative. Levine continues, ""sitting is more dangerous than smoking, kills more people than HIV and is more treacherous than parachuting. We are sitting ourselves to death.""

Sitting is bad for you for two main reasons. First, too many of us are choosing to sit instead of walking, biking, running, doing yard work or lifting weights. Television, computers, game consoles, phones and tablets seem to have us permanently pinned us to our chairs.

Second, sitting too long is just plain bad for you. It isn't bad per se -- if we sit correctly and for limited durations. However, sitting improperly is bad for our posture and hard on our organs. Sitting for long stretches makes us far more likely to suffer from serious health conditions.

A 2014 article in The Active Times by Diana Gerstacker cites research showing that sitting increases markedly our risk of getting cancer, heart disease, obesity and Type 2 diabetes and having muscle impairment and depression. She refers to a study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, ""which (found) that sitting for long periods of time increases your risk for colon, endometrial and, possibly, lung cancer."" Shockingly, ""even in physically active individuals, sitting increased the risk, and the risk worsened with each two-hour increase in sitting time.""

Gerstacker continues, ""Sitting, like smoking, is very clearly bad for our health and the only way to minimize the risk is to limit the time we spend on our butts each day."" And sitting is not offset by exercise.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2012 only one-quarter of American children ages 12 to 15 got the federally recommended amount of exercise (60 minutes per day). We are witnessing a frightening national epidemic of inactivity. The manifold increase in children's screen time watching movies or TV, playing video games or engaging with a computer, tablet or smartphone keeps them indoors and sedentary. No wonder obesity is gaining among juveniles and even children under 12. Kids rarely ride their bikes anywhere. Almost all bike trips are taken by adults. Fewer children walk to school or engage in manual labor like working in the family garden. Playing outside for hours at a time as previous generations did as children seems to have been curtailed by parents' concern for their children's security and by the siren song of electronic devices.

People look to schools to provide children with physical activity at recess or in gym classes. They also expect the school system to teach children good nutrition and, to some degree, eating habits. But schools are having difficulty fitting all this in because of the heavy emphasis on teaching and testing reading, math and science. Recently, the Utah State Board of Education removed the requirements for physical education, although it is still part of the state core. It is now up to school districts whether to require physical education. The board was responding to some school districts that have decreased the overall number of class periods in high school, which limits students' options to take such elective courses as theater, debate and choir and limits opportunities for physical education.

The American lifestyle has become dangerous as many of us -- young and old -- yield to a state of physical passivity. This is a public health hazard with grave implications for the health and well-being of Americans. If Americans stay on their path of inactivity and poor diet that results in obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and depression, it will swamp our health care system and have dire implications for a productive workforce.

For your health and well-being and for your family's sake, get up and move. Be active with your children and grandchildren. Take them on a hike or to the park and limit screen time -- yours and theirs. Try standing at work. Hold walking meetings. Get a stand-up desk. Take the stairs. Get up from your chair every hour and move around. Get a phone app that prompts you to stand up every hour. Walk around during phone conversations. You'll feel much better.

Remember, ""sitting is the new smoking.""

158,158,"""The world outside is like another planet,"" writes Jack Powers from ADX. ""I feel like I am trapped within a disease.""

This story, written by Colorado Independent editor Susan Greene, was first published in 2012 by the Dart Society (now the Ochberg Society) an international group of journalists who cover trauma. The state of Colorado since has cut down on its use of solitary confinement significantly. Still, some state prisoners - as well prisoners in county jails and the entire prison population at the federal ADX Supermax in Florence - remain in various forms of long-term isolation, as do prisoners in many other states. Susan will be honored for this story, among other work, by the ACLU of Colorado at its annual civil rights dinner on September 28.

A few weeks ago, on the fifteenth anniversary of his first day in prison, Osiel Rodriguez set about cleaning the 87 square feet he inhabits at ADX, a federal mass isolation facility in Colorado.

""I got it in my head to destroy all my photographs,"" he writes in a letter to me. ""I spent some five hours ripping each one to pieces. No one was safe. I did not save one of my mother, father, sisters. Who are those people anyway?""

Such is the logic of the gray box, of sitting year after year in solitude.

Whether Rodriguez had psychological problems when he robbed a bank, burglarized a pawn shop and stole some guns at age 22, or whether mental illness set in during the eight years he has spent in seclusion since trying to walk out of a federal penitentiary in Florida - it's academic. What's true now is that he's sick, literally, of being alone, as are scores of other prisoners in extreme isolation.

Among the misperceptions about solitary confinement is that it's used only on the most violent inmates, and only for a few weeks or months. In fact, an estimated 80,000 Americans -- many with no record of violence either inside or outside prison -- are living in seclusion. They stay there for years, even decades. What this means, generally, is 23 hours a day in a cell the size of two queen-sized mattresses, with a single hour in an exercise cage, also alone. Some prisoners aren't allowed visits or phone calls. Some have no TV or radio. Some never lay eyes on each other. And some go years without fresh air or sunlight.

Solitary is a place where the slightest details can mean the world. Things like whether you can see a patch of grass or only sky outside your window - if you're lucky enough to have a window. Or whether the guy who occupies cells before you in rotation has a habit of smearing feces on the wall. Are the lights on 24/7? Is there a clock or calendar to mark time? If you scream, could anyone hear you?

In the warp of time and space where Rodriguez lives, the system not only has stripped him of any real human contact, but also made it unbearable to be reminded of a reality that has become all too unreal. It's ripping him apart.

""Looking at photos of the free world caused me so much pain that I just couldn't do it any more,"" writes Rodriguez, 36. ""Time and these conditions are breaking me down.""

This is what our prisons are doing to people in the name of safety. This is how deeply we're burying them.

I got my first letter from solitary in 2008 while working as a newspaper columnist in Colorado. Mark Jordan -- then at ADX on convictions for bank robbery and a prison murder - wrote asking me to cover a trial in which he'd be arguing for access to reading materials that seemed a reasonable way to cope inside a concrete box. The Federal Bureau of Prisons had banned, for instance, D.H. Lawrence's Sons and Lovers and Anaïs Nin's books, which Jordan had already ordered. Officers in the mailroom wouldn't pass along his issues of The New Yorker, either, because some of the cartoons depict nude figures.

Intrigued, I went to hear Jordan represent himself in federal court by a live video feed from prison. Though he was shackled as he made his case, his arguments were as skilled as those of the most seasoned trial attorneys I had seen. He lost.

Solitary confinement slipped from my mind after I covered Jordan's case and moved on to my next deadline. But the subject became a preoccupation months later while I was hospitalized for septic pneumonia, with an ""ISOLATION"" sign outside my door. Partly it was the stale air in my hospital room and the view of a brick wall out my window. Partly it was the anxiety of losing my autonomy and voice. I'd lie there pressing a buzzer to get a glass of water or to have my tubes unhooked so I could get out of bed, and nobody would answer. I'd buzz and buzz again, complaining bitterly once nurses finally showed up. I'd see them roll their eyes and hear them dissing me in the hallway. Being sick wasn't as bad as being stuck. I remember thinking about Jordan and wondering how people who were imprisoned in solitary were able to survive it. It occurred to me then that isolation - the non-medical, punitive, indefinite kind - could crack you in about a week. Powerlessness is its own centrifugal force.

Plenty of corrections officers might tell you that offenders doing time in solitary don't deserve the roofs over their heads or the meals shoved through their food slots. To be sure, many of these prisoners have done heinous, unforgivable things for which we lock them up tightly. Just how tightly is no small question. Yet, as a matter of public policy, the question hardly comes up. Compared to how much we as a nation have debated capital punishment, a sentence served by a small fraction of the incarcerated, we barely discuss how severely we're willing to punish nearly everyone else.

""When the door is locked against the prisoner, we do not think about what is behind it,"" Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy once said.

Solitary confinement started in the U.S. as a morally progressive social experiment in the 1820s by Quakers who wanted lawmakers to replace mutilations, amputations and the death penalty with rehabilitation. The hope was that long periods of introspection would help criminals repent.

After touring a Pennsylvania prison in the 1840s, Charles Dickens described prolonged isolation as a ""slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain immeasurably worse than any torture of the body."" He also wrote, ""There is a depth of terrible endurance in it which none but the sufferers themselves can fathom.""

Some of his contemporaries shared that view. ""It devours the victims incessantly and unmercifully,"" Alexis de Tocqueville reported from a prison in New York in the 1820s. ""It does not reform, it kills.""

Most prisons suspended the practice in the mid- to late-1800s once it became clear the theory didn't work. The U.S. Supreme Court punctuated that point in 1890 when it freed a Colorado man who had been sentenced to death for killing his wife, recognizing the psychological harm isolation had caused him.

""This matter of solitary confinement is not ... a mere unimportant regulation as to the safe-keeping of the prisoner,"" the court ruled in the case of James Medley. ""A considerable number of the prisoners fell, after even a short confinement, into a semi-fatuous condition, from which it was next to impossible to arouse them, while those who stood the ordeal better were not generally reformed, and in most cases did not recover sufficient mental activity to be of any subsequent service to the community.""

Solitary confinement was largely unused for about a century until October 1983 when, in separate incidents, inmates killed two guards in one day at the U.S. Penitentiary in Marion, Ill., which had replaced Alcatraz as home to the most dangerous federal convicts. The prison went into lockdown for the next 23 years, setting the model for dozens of state and federal supermaxes - prisons designed specifically for mass isolation -- that since have been built in the name of officer safety. ""Never again,"" promised Reagan-era shock doctrinarians who set out at great cost to crack down on prison violence.

""Whole prisons have been built, people have gotten funding for supermax facilities based on the act of a single (inmate),"" says Michael Randle, former director of the Illinois Department of Corrections.

Administered by corrections officials, not judges, solitary confinement is a punishment beyond incarceration, removing prisoners not only from the rest of society, but also from each other and staff. It's now practiced routinely in federal penitentiaries, state prisons and local jails under a number of bureaucratic labels: ""lockdown,"" ""protective custody,"" ""strip cells,"" ""control units,"" ""security housing units,"" ""special management units"" and ""administrative segregation."" Federal justice officials say the different classifications prevent them from keeping track of how many people are being isolated. What is acknowledged even in official records is that the vast majority are men and that rates of pre-existing mental illness exceed the higher-than-average levels in general prison populations.

Prisoners who have assaulted staff often get sent straight to solitary. Those who have killed other inmates or escaped from prison -- or attempted to -- also take priority. Corrections officials eager to please officers' unions and weary of public criticism tend to place difficult prisoners in solitary as an easy default.

""These become career decisions that administrators have to struggle with, knowing if a person does kill again, that you basically will get massacred in the media, massacred by the opposition, massacred by your governor's party,"" Randle says. ""These are determinations that can make or break your career.""

Meantime, an analysis of prison budgets by the Urban Institute shows that taxpayers are shelling out about $75,000 a year to house a single prisoner in solitary confinement - more than twice as much as spent housing prisoners in general population. Staffing is more expensive because two or more officers usually are required to escort prisoners any time they leave their cells, and because the cooking and cleaning work, which in other prisons would be performed by inmates, must be done by paid staff. As a rule, prisoners in isolation aren't allowed to work.

For reasons of prison safety, short periods of confinement may make sense for the most violent inmates. Yet the so-called ""worst of the worst"" are, by definition, the exception rather than the rule. States vastly overestimated the need for supermax space to contain high-risk offenders, and have filled it with relatively low-risk prisoners, many of whom pose no apparent risk or have no record of violence. Anyone even loosely labeled to have ties with terrorists gets put into isolation as a matter of course. Juveniles are secluded for what is officially deemed to be their own protection. Mentally ill prisoners who are prone to rage or agitation are isolated for convenience. And, all too often, having a gang affiliation, writing grievances or cussing out a guard can land you in solitary for the long haul. Bad behavior - or merely a corrections officer's allegation of it - can add years to your time in isolation. Some prisoners have spent a decade or two asking why they're still there, without getting an official answer.

""These are extraordinary, I believe often needless and indefensible, risks to take with the human psyche and spirit,"" writes Craig Haney, a psychology professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz.

Anthony Gay had a low-level assault charge in Illinois for punching another kid, stealing a dollar from him and swiping his hat. A parole violation on his seven-year suspended sentence ultimately landed him in a state supermax where he has cut himself hundreds of times with shards of glass and metal, and eats his own flesh. He has racked up a 97-year sentence for throwing urine and feces out his food slot - behavior that's fairly typical for severely mentally ill prisoners in solitary.

Gay passes his time at the Tamms Correctional Center writing anyone who will receive his letters.

""I've been trapped for approximately nine years. The trap, like a fly on sticky paper, aggravates and agitates me,"" he writes. ""America, can you hear me? I love you America, but if you love me, please speak out and stand up against solitary confinement.""

In months of trading letters with prisoners, and in a few dozen interviews with men who've gotten out, I hear the same descriptions of solitary: that it's starkly sterile, unremittingly monotonous and numbingly idle.

""Ninety percent of the time you hear nothing but the sound of air from the ventilation. The silence can drive you crazy. Makes you feel as if the world has ended but you somehow survived and are tripped,"" Jeremy Pinson writes from ADX, the crown jewel of the federal system once described by its warden as a ""clean version of hell.""

""The world outside is like another planet,"" writes Jack Powers, also from ADX. ""I feel like I am trapped within a disease.""

Prisoners pace their cells like caged felines at a zoo.

""I walked and walked and walked some more,"" says Darrell Cannon, who did nine years in solitary in Illinois. ""I'd walk in circles - always to the left, for some reason - for six, maybe seven hours a day.""

Almost everyone in isolation spends at least some time counting. They count the steps they take, the cinder blocks on the walls, the tiles on the ceiling, their sneezes and coughs, and how many times the furnace kicks in or the plumbing sloshes.

""If I remember correctly, there are 412 holes in (the cell door). I would count them daily,"" Joe Sorrentino, now serving time in a general population prison, recalls of his cell at Tamms. ""At the back of the cell, close to the ceiling there's a window approx. 30 inches long and 10 inches high with a square bar going through the middle .... My window faced the tunnel, so my view for my first seven years there were of a blue wall. For years, I wondered what other guys could see out their windows.""

Some prisoners pass their time praying, meditating or talking to themselves. Some read voraciously, though often they're limited to only a few books a month. Some take whatever enrichment classes are broadcast over their TVs. The Bureau of Prisons has offered courses on Hitler, Sparta, Animals of the World, Legends of the Silver Screen and Robert E. Lee and his High Command.

Out of limited supplies, prisoners create art. They lodge bits of sponges into ballpoint cartridges to make paintbrushes. For paint, they mix water with Nescafe grinds or dye from candy they can buy from the commissary. M&Ms - plain, not peanut - work best. For deep reds, they fold red dye in with ground powder from vitamins. Navy blue takes a three-step process mixing royal blue candy coating with blue and black ink from pens. The color purple is best achieved from Skittles.

Prisoners strike up relationships with the critters that crawl in through their air vents. One man used his own hairs to try to repair a moth's injured wing in hopes of facilitating its escape. Mohammed Saleh -- convicted of having co-conspired in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing -- lost his daily hour of outdoor recreation for three months at ADX because he saved bread crumbs to feed blackbirds in his exercise pen.

Defiance can kill time in solitary. Some prisoners kick the walls or bang their cups against their doors. Some flood their cells by clogging their toilets with toilet paper, or break light bulbs and set their mattresses on fire. Some write up their grievances; some sue over them; and some sue some more on behalf of guys on their units. Those feeling especially resistant stop eating or drinking. Brian Nelson starved himself regularly at Tamms, where he spent 12 years in seclusion. He once refused food and water for 40 days, he says, to try to prod the prison to treat a guy on his unit for cancer.

""(Fasts) become addicting.... You feel clean, but it's also your body eating your body,"" says Nelson. ""My last hunger strike, I was on a gurney and there was no vital signs, and I went into shock.""

A hunger strike by 5,000 prisoners last fall shed light on solitary confinement conditions at California's Pelican Bay State Prison. The strike ended when the state agreed to consider letting prisoners make phone calls and buy calendars. Months later, no substantive changes have been made on those modest demands. There have been reports that strike leaders have faced disciplinary action and that three strikers have committed suicide.

Many of us flirt with isolation. We tune out in all sorts of ways - cranking up our headphones or holing up in little rooms to write. From ""Walden"" to ""Into the Wild,"" generations have idealized solitude, wondering how long we could last on our own. Fox Reality Channel's show ""Solitary"" kept contestants in voluntary round-the-clock confinement competing for $50,000 in prize money. The goal was to be the last player to quit by hitting the panic button. Boredom.com, a video game maker, has virtualized lockdown with ""Escape 3D: The Jail."" You can feign confinement in the comfort of your home or office, or, thanks to a handy smart phone app, idle in solitary on the subway or in line at the DMV.

Still, we know from all manner of solo expeditions, behavioral tests, biological experiments and psychological studies that we're not wired to be alone. Early in the space age, cosmonauts training to fly Soviet rockets were put into isolation chambers without any way of knowing how much time was ticking by. Some gave up within hours. One, Andrian Nikolayev, earned hero status and the nickname ""Iron Man"" after setting a four-day record before pressing a buzzer to be released.

The human brain needs social contact like our lungs need air. Social needs are so basic that they drive family structures, religions, urban design, governments, economies and legal systems worldwide. We honor these needs even with pets and zoo animals, generally acknowledging the inhumanity of caging them for long periods of time alone or in tight spaces. New federal guidelines on the use of laboratory animals require relatively more space, sensory stimulation and environmental enrichment than we afford people in confinement. The revised rules put forth by the National Academy of Sciences call for significantly more square footage to house a head of cattle, for example, than prisons provide in solitary.

Convicts in the U.S. are not afforded such concern. We push some of them into seclusion with little to no programmatic support, basically giving up on them.

""Anyone who spends more than three years in a place like this is ruined for life,"" Powers writes. ""Two or three hundred years from now people will look back on this lockdown mania like we look back on the burning of witches.""

In 2006, a bipartisan national task force convened by the Vera Institute for Justice called for ending solitary confinement beyond periods of about ten days. The report by the Commission on Safety and Abuse in American Prisons found practically no benefits from supermax conditions either for prisoners or the public. It cited studies showing that solitary confinement impairs brain function and can cause psychosis and serious depression. It also cited a number of reports showing that long-term isolation doesn't curb prison violence and makes it highly likely that prisoners will commit more crimes when released.

The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan Mendez, is calling to end the use of isolation on juveniles and the mentally ill. For everyone else, he is pushing a worldwide limit of 15 days. Mendez personally endured three days in solitary under the rule of a junta in Argentina - an experience he describes as ""the darkest days of my life."" So far, he has been unable to gain access to investigate state and federal prisons in the U.S.

""Let's just say it has been a challenge,"" he says.

U.S. courts have rejected most 8th Amendment claims against isolation, ruling that some psychological harm to certain prisoners doesn't make the entire practice cruel or unusual. In many cases, corrections officials have persuaded judges that isolation is a misnomer because prisoners glean brief interactions with guards - exchanges that are at best perfunctory and at worst hostile, degrading and cruel. They'll also argue that prisoners shouting to each other between cellblocks, across exercise cages or down drainpipes constitute meaningful forms of social interaction.

* * *

For every hunger striker, jailhouse lawyer and cellblock arsonist, there are many more people in solitary who've folded up quietly into themselves.

""I became increasingly withdrawn at ADX to the point where the only people I interacted with were the television characters on 'Seinfeld.' I watched 'Seinfeld' four times a day. Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer became my best friends. I felt like part of their family. They were the only friends I had,"" Anthony McBayne wrote in a legal declaration.

Some prisoners say they forget what day, month or year it is, partly because keeping track can be too painful.

""Time is the enemy, a constant reminder that your life is being wasted and there is no redemptive solution. Paying close attention to time will in short order drive you to misery and despair at what you've lost,"" Jeremy Pinson writes.

Concentration wanes, revenge fantasies fester and voices echo in people's heads. Idiosyncrasies grow into obsessions about the tiniest details of physical space. Prisoner after prisoner writes of becoming enraged by slight noises or tweaks in their routines.

Some describe losing their senses of self, physically and emotionally. Mirrors, if available, are stainless steel plates that reflect only blurs. You can go years without an accurate picture of your own aging. Basic biographical facts - your age, your birthday - can get lost in a fog.

""This is difficult to explain, but my memories were no longer mine,"" Mark Jordan writes of his years at ADX. ""I questioned whether or not I really had a past or history at all, whether the memories were real or false.... It was as though none of it was real. I was born into this life of isolation and the memories not memories at all. Confabulations.""

We in the free world know who we are by interacting with each other. We make sense of ourselves largely through our relationships. Legal sociologist Joan Martel described the loss of identity in isolation. ""To be,"" she writes, ""one has to be somewhere."" Without normal grounding in space or time, isolated prisoners lose their understanding of themselves and their own histories.

""After 14 years, those people are strangers to me; as I must be to them,"" Osiel Rodriguez wrote about the family members whose portraits he destroyed. ""My parents will be dust if/when I ever get out of prison. My three sisters will be in their mid-70's to late 60's. So what was I doing holding on to photos of moments I was not a part of, or know nothing about?""

In his mind, Stephen Slevin spent two months in solitary confinement after being arrested on a drunk driving charge and booked into New Mexico's Doña Ana County Detention Center. In real time, it was 20 months before the charge was dropped and, ungroomed and delusional, he was released. Those 18 months are still missing somewhere inside him, he now says. Yesterday, a jury awarded him $22 million in damages associated with his time in solitary.

* * *

Covering solitary is an exercise in inaccessibility.

Reporters' visits and phone calls are out of the question.

State and county prisoners usually can be glimpsed only by their mug shots. The federal system makes no photos available of the people it locks up or the spaces they inhabit.

Family members can pass along information - if a prisoner chooses not to shield them from what isolation is really like.

""My philosophy is, I don't care if you have a knife stuck in your back, you tell your mom that you're okay,"" Sorrentino writes. ""Seeing how they looked at me on visits, handcuffed, shackled, chained to the floor and behind glass, killed me inside.""

Prison officials don't help much with transparency or public accountability. They cite pending lawsuits and security risks for refusing to be interviewed. They have scoffed when I've asked if they'd consider passing a disposable camera or hand-held recorder to a man who hasn't been seen or heard from in years. (""What do you think we are -- bellhops at the Hyatt Regency?"") Officers are dispatched to berate journalists, even off grounds, for aiming lenses toward their prisons.

""The inmates housed at the ADX pose the greatest threat within the Federal Bureau of Prisons to staff, other inmates, visitors, and the public, and may be extreme escape risks,"" Warden Blake R. Davis wrote to me. ""Accordingly, permitting a film crew to take video footage of the exterior of the institution would negatively affect the security and orderly operation of the facility.""

Years ago, while assigned to cover Area 51 in Nevada, I had better access to a federal airbase that didn't officially exist.

* * *

Letters from isolation are always handwritten (supermaxes don't provide access to computers, which some long-timers have never even used). They arrive on government-issue loose-leaf paper in government-issue white envelopes, often quilted with 1-cent and 5-cent postage stamps bartered somehow between cells.

Some - especially those from prisons allowing showers only once a week -- come smelling like confinement.

Certain prisoners struggle with their writing.

""Miz Greene. Weyre traped. Police help us,"" reads one letter, start to finish, from a man named Paz at Pelican Bay.

Others write so well that it hurts.

""I miss being around people. I miss being able to run on the track or walk on grass or feel the sun on my face,"" reads one of Jack Powers' letters. ""One time I kept a single green leaf alive for a few weeks. And one time I had grasshopper for a pet. And one time I made a dwarf tree out of yarn from a green winter hat, paper and dried tea bags. I made a guitar out of milk cartons, and it played quite well. I invented a perfect family - mom, dad and sister - so that we could interact and love one another. One time I wanted to take a bath, so I got into a garbage bag and put water in it and sat there. For a while I made vases out of toilet paper and soap and ink from a pen. I have done a thousand and one things to replicate ordinary life, but these too are now gone.""

From solitary, I've received marriage proposals, tomes of legal documents and a Christmas card crafted out of a Wortz Cheese Crackers box. One man mailed three weeks' worth of daily manifestos about Yahweh. People in confinement have criticized me for my grammar and syntax, cursed me for not writing more often and advised me to go lock myself in my bathroom to deepen my understanding of their plight.

Some letters are angry rants. Others are full of longing.

A prisoner in Virginia wrote 16 pages on behalf of the guy howling night and day in a cell down the hall, never once using the word ""I."" Another in Illinois wrote a regretful 22-page essay about the man he had killed half a lifetime ago, imagining what might have happened to them each if he hadn't pulled the trigger.

From the cutters, I've been given step-by-step accounts of their attempts to feel something, anything, in the tedium. Anthony Gay seems to want me and all of America to understand exactly how he's hurting himself.

""When my anxiety becomes overwhelming ... I'll pull out my cutting instrument, pull off my boxer shorts, sit on my toilet and cut a gash in my thigh,"" Gay writes. ""If I happen to become extremely anxious, I'll slice my penis like a hot dog or my testicle like a tomato.""

A man who tried to hang himself in his cell asked for my help reimbursing the state of Illinois $56 for a torn bed sheet. Attempted suicide in solitary often is treated as a disciplinary problem.

""When I'm put on a suicide watch, I'm all alone and stripped naked and may see a mental health staff for 3-4 minutes a day. So I wonder dam how is this pose to help me. It don't,"" Bobby Boyd writes from Tamms.

Some prisoners recognize their mental health problems. Others write around them.

More often than I'll ever know, my letters haven't reached the men I've mailed them to. Some have come back to me marked that they were rejected by prisoners I'm sure didn't reject them. Even more often, their letters to me don't make it past the mailroom.

Between the lines of the ones that do, most letters from solitary say the same thing: That we're all higher than the lowest things we've ever done. For most of the so-called ""worst of the worst"" who bother writing, there seems to be at least some capacity for redemption.

* * *

It's no small thing to ask someone who has spent years without social contact to sit and tell his story. I learned this waiting at a Kmart café in Denver, a donut shop in Chicago and Union Station in Washington, D.C., for men who had recently been released but didn't show up for interviews as they agreed. Saying no -- or that they were scared to leave home or just not up to talking -- apparently didn't seem like an option.

Some who did show up had trouble shaking my hand or looking me in the eye or crying in front of me.

""I'm gonna push through my nerves, see, because I've been waiting like 20-something years to say all this,"" Vincente Rodriguez told me when we met in his living room in Chicago.

Rodriguez's seven months in the free world haven't been easy. Like lots of guys, he curls up in a corner of his apartment, blinds drawn, alone. He says he likes it that way, and it worries him.

Robert Felton retreats to his bedroom in Danville, Ill. His wife and young kids wonder why he won't hang out or cuddle in front of the TV. He can't bring himself to tell them that he now finds such closeness intolerable.

These are the guys next door, the men refereeing your kids' basketball games, the hothead in line at the Conoco who freaks when someone brushes against him.

In the 18 months Brian Nelson has been out of solitary, he has found a job, a girlfriend and a car. He drives when he's anxious, and is anxious often. Nelson curses himself when he loses his way on the streets of Chicago, the city he knew well until age 17 when a murder conviction landed him a 28-year sentence.

""I'm here, but I'm not here, if that makes any sense,"" he says from behind the wheel of his Jeep Compass, disoriented on the South Side. ""People ask me what hurts. I say the box, the gray box. I can feel those walls and I can taste them every day of my life. I'm still there, really. And I'm not sure when I'm ever gonna get out.""

Nelson -- whose lawsuits from isolation improved conditions for prisoners in Illinois -- works in a law office as an advocate for prisoners he left behind in confinement. Compared to other guys who've been released, he is doing well. Yet he's flailing. He's facing a DUI charge while on parole. He recently gave himself a black eye. The experience of being interviewed on camera sent him back into a box emotionally for weeks.

Anthony McBayne, the ""Seinfeld"" fan, realized after his release from prison that he'd never recover from his years in solitary. Once faced with social situations, he says he would speak so fast that he'd stutter. He came to avoid people and wouldn't look at them.

""Later on, when I did look, it was only to read their lips, as it's how I remember to 'hear' from when prisoners would talk through the thick glass at ADX when one prisoner was in a rec cage and I was in my cell,"" reads his legal declaration. ""I found myself doing this all the time after my release and it became so annoying that I had to lie and tell people that I was deaf and needed to read lips to hear.""

McBayne robbed a bank after his release. He's now doing time at U.S. Penitentiary Big Sandy in Kentucky.

Joe Sorrentino, who is serving life on a murder conviction, remembers passing time in Tamms by drawing blueprints of a house he'll never be able to build. All his designs included secret passages and hidden rooms where he could go to be alone. He has since been transferred out of solitary into a general population prison in Stateville.

""I have a huge sense of guilt for not being at Tamms,"" he writes. ""I feel completely empty and purposeless now. Plus, I hate being around people, period. I have a good cellmate, but I can't stand being this close to another human being. I get frustrated very easily and the littlest things irk me. When I first arrived here, I attempted to make contact with mental health to try to get a one-man cell. She basically told me to 'get over it,' then asked if I wanted medication - which I don't want. What I really want, deep inside, is to go back.""

""Trauma"" is one of them, especially when used about people who have traumatized others. ""Torture"" is another. In the moral balance of crime and punishment, the word risks discounting the suffering convicts have brought their own victims.

Nothing is black and white in a gray box. Lines can blur between the good guys and the bad ones. It's far easier to label the secret police in some foreign dictatorship as torturers than to lob the word at prison guards in the next county.

It isn't news that solitary confinement hurts people. Dickens, de Tocqueville and the Supreme Court -- they all knew it generations ago. But our memory is disturbingly short. What's considered cruel and unusual under the 8th Amendment pivots on the ""evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society."" Our continuing reliance on solitary confinement as a default for difficult prisoners raises the question of how much, if at all, we have progressed.

Jack Powers, now in his 11th year at ADX, mentions in almost all his letters that every day is a struggle not to lose what's left of his free will.

""I could lie back, watch TV, eat chips and jack off all day and say to hell with it. But I cannot because there is some force of principle in my mind that will not allow me to do so,"" he writes. ""I am a voice crying out in a place where no one can hear me. I am saying, 'Wait! We have it all wrong! We can do better than this!' But maybe we cannot. Maybe we are just stuck with what it is. Maybe I am afraid of the world and of being human and of lacking love. Maybe we all are. Maybe this is all we are capable of."
159,159,"While the phone you carry may be significantly less bulky than some of the original mobile devices, it's one heck of a lot more powerful. It has a touch screen, lacks a hinge and is filled with apps. And those apps are getting smarter every day with the help of machine learning and AI.

As we use our phones, we provide key information to the apps and software installed on them. Developers in turn, utilize that info to create smarter, more personalized experiences.

AI and machine learning operate a little differently than most of the tech you're probably familiar with. So, it's helpful to understand a few key tech concepts to be able to fully grasp what's happening. (But don't worry -- we're talking big picture, not the ones and zeroes of it all.)

Moore is Better

Computer technology has relied upon silicon chips since the integrated circuit board was adopted mid-twentieth century. Prior to that, computers ran on huge vacuum tube powered devices that took up entire rooms.

When chip manufacturers -- the original unicorns -- and powerhouse startups got more heavily involved, Silicon Valley was born. But we've come a long way from Fairchild and Shockley, the semiconductor companies that helped give rise to the age of modern computing at Apple and Intel.

Most advances in computer technology have involved manual coding and programming and were governed by the framework of Moore's Law -- which stated that computing and processing speeds would double every two years. As we inch ever closer to reaching the culmination of a computing world defined by Moore's Law, programmers and scientists are increasingly looking at technology that allows computers to teach themselves by learning to evaluate and parse data.

What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning needs data it can learn from to be able to work. This often takes the form of text, words, photographs, musical preferences, online purchases -- even your social media updates. The byproduct for consumers and professionals is smarter apps powered by applications that can learn, synthesize and leverage algorithms that are helping solve large, unscalable problems in virtually every industry imaginable.

An excellent example of this is how Facebook has learned from photographs. With hundreds of thousands of photos uploaded as status updates, Facebook applied machine learning techniques to understand the context of photos and who is in each picture. Facebook has gotten very good at learning the difference between a cat and your significant other from the massive stream of photographs.

Harnessing the Potential Power of AI / ML

Depending on who you ask or what you read, there's a pretty strong consensus that machine learning and AI will have a strong impact on the future of how we drive, eat, shop and communicate.

A key debate about machine learning and artificial intelligence is how it can be leveraged for good -- and potentially for less-than-noble purposes. You don't have to look far to see the ongoing conversations among journalists and even tech moguls about the seismic changes machine learning will bring.

Andrew Ng, former head of AI for Baidu, has said that machine learning and AI ""Will also now change nearly every major industry -- healthcare, transportation, entertainment, manufacturing.""

Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, warns that AI is one of humanity's biggest concerns and ""poses existential risks."" Eric Schmidt also donated $2 million to Princeton to fund a program to better understand the underpinnings and evolution of machine learning.

There's no doubt that a lot of people are starting to see how machine learning and AI might change their industries. Trucking, transportation, manufacturing and logistics are some of the first places changes could take effect.

Machine learning also has the potential to profoundly and positively impact society by removing redundancies in the workplace, making us safer on the road and changing the way we manage healthcare. But before you start worrying about machines making all people ""redundant,"" remember, there are a few key skills that will require human thinking and learning:

Machine Driven

Machine learning has created an entire generation of smart apps and products that are proving to be important parts of our daily lives.

Driverless Cars

The watershed year for cars and machine learning was 2016. Fueled by a spree of bets from large auto manufacturers and a handful of acquisitions, last year was an indication that executives thought machine learning was soon going to propel driverless technologies into the mainstream.

Social Good

When many complained that #FakeNews was drowning out verified news sources, Facebook leveraged machine learning to combat the problem and provide accurate and truthful context to their trending news feeds.

Healthcare

Researchers are at critical junctures in understanding, diagnosing and treating disease. IBM's Watson has helped physicians connect patients to clinical trials for cancer treatment.

We're just starting to see some of these changes roll out, but there's no doubt there will be some major enhancements in nearly every part of our daily lives. Whether it's making your email smarter, streamlining tasks or solving the riddle of incurable diseases, AI and machine learning will probably have a huge impact in your life. And sooner than you think.

160,160,"Harvey's floodwaters are beginning to recede in Houston and the devastating storm is finally loosening its grip on the Gulf Coast, but many dangers and hardships still loom for drenched residents in Texas and Louisiana.

Thousands still remain in shelters across the region, awaiting news of when they can return to their devastated homes and neighborhoods. A series of explosions at a chemical plant and the threat of toxic waste and crude oil seeping into floodwaters have sparked health concerns. State and federal officials are working overtime to get airports, railways and highways up and running at pre-Harvey levels.

And then there are the scams.

Targeting both Harvey victims and those looking to donate to relief efforts, scam artists are using the storm - and people's sense of charity - the swindle thousands of dollars from unwitting targets. In order to prevent any more victims, Fox News has compiled a list of some of the more popular scams and how to avoid them:

Flood Insurance Scams: Numerous homeowners and renters throughout Texas and Louisiana are getting robocalls that inform them that their flood premiums are overdue. To make sure they're covered for any damage from Harvey, the automated calls say, policy holders must pay immediately or risk losing it all. ""Don't do it,"" the Federal Trade Commission noted in a warning about the scams. ""Your reports help the FTC and other law enforcement agencies bring scam artists to justice and put an end to unfair and misleading business practices.""

Instead, the FTC advises that anyone concerned about their flood premiums call their insurance agent because he or she could be the same person who also handles your flood insurance policy.

Charity Scams: With Americans across the country donating millions of dollars to charities providing relief efforts to victims of Harvey, it should come as no surprise that criminals looking to make a quick buck will prey on those with a benevolent heart. There have been numerous reports of people receiving phone calls, text messages, emails or posts on their social media accounts that ask for money for Harvey relief efforts. While there are a number of legitimate organizations that are helping collect money for Harvey victims -- the American Red Cross, Direct Relief and Catholic Charities are just a few of the biggest -- it is sometimes hard to determine which charity is real and which is a scam.

The FTC has posted a charity checklist for donors to follow so they don't get bamboozled. Among their recommendations are checking with the National Association of State Charity Officials to see if the group contacting you is registered, never sending a cash donation and being wary of groups that spring up too suddenly in response to current events and natural disaster. Another great way to find a legitimate charity is to visit Charity Navigator's Hurricane Harvey page, which has compiled a list of highly-rated organizations responding in the aftermath.

Phishing Scams: Hard to avoid and even harder to trace, email phishing scams have become the con of choice for hackers looking to rip-off altruistic Americans. These crooks send out messages via email or social media with links that promise to help you aid Harvey victims. Instead these links send you to bogus websites that can pinch your login and credit card information, infect computers with malware and even steal your identity.

The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) issued a warning Monday that noted these phishing scams have cropped up before during previous natural disasters and warning donors to be on the lookout. ""[R]emain vigilant for malicious cyber activity seeking to capitalize on interest in Hurricane Harvey,"" the advisory read. ""Emails requesting donations from duplicitous charitable organizations commonly appear after major natural disasters.""

Crowdfunding Scams: Over the last few years, crowdfunding has become one of the most popular ways for everybody from cancer patients to new businesses to raise money, with sites like GoFundMe and Kickstarter leading the pack. But they could also be used by criminals as a way to bilk people donating to a cause, only to keep the money for themselves. To help prevent their site from being abused by phonies, GoFundMe briefed officials in Texas and Louisiana on the steps the company was taking to ensure all of the funds raised on their site go to the right place.

""We are hoping for the best, planning for the worst, and we will stay in close touch with all organizers and beneficiaries to ensure the resources get to people in need as soon as possible,"" the company wrote in a post on Medium. ""When all's said and done, what matters most to us is that you are protected and those who need help get the help they deserve.""

Copycat Scams: Similar to the phishing scams, these ploys use a name or URL that closely resembles that of well-known charitable organizations in order to trick people into thinking it is a real group. The FTC warns donors to double-check any URLs as most websites of legitimate charities end in .org instead of .com. Also another red flag is groups asking for money transfers as most legitimate organizations don't solicit these types of donations."

163,163,"The long security lines at airports could soon be history -- if a new computer, based not on silicon but on live mice neurons, is adopted.

Oshiorenoya Agabi, a Silicon Valley-based neurotechnology entrepreneur, said that they have built a device that merges synthetic neurobiology with silicon. The modem-sized device, known as Koniku Kore, gives them an unprecedented ability to become aware of surroundings, sniff out explosives, and even detect cancer cells.

Agabi was speaking at TEDGlobal in Arusha, Tanzania, which brought together 700 researchers, innovators, and academics from all over the world to discuss Africa's next big leap in technology, science, and politics. Agabi believes that artificial intelligence will ""ultimately be accomplished by exclusive use of actual biological neurons."" Instead of copying them, he said, we need to take them and engineer them in order to build computers that think or work like humans do.

""Biology is technology,"" he said. ""Biology has the most extensive open source hardware and software.""

The role of artificial intelligence and what the creation of humanoid devices will mean for the future of the human race has proved contentious over the years. Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has even spoken of humans evolving into cyborgs, starting a medical research company Neuralink that aims to embed electrodes in people's brains. The ethical decision-making of connected devices has also raised questions over how to program machines and whether humans can trust machines with moral decisions.

Agabi says the world should deploy as many resources to develop devices that would solve global problems like terrorism or cancer. Koniku, he said, was already building an assembly line for combining biological machines with silicon devices and creating an entirely new class of devices and a new market. Agabi said that major brands were already using his technology, with the company's current $8 million revenue expected to increase to $30 million in 2018. The eventual goal, he added, was to build a cognitive system based on living neurons within 5 to 7 years.

""This is a world first,"" Agabi said.

164,164,"The opinions of researchers on the state and future of research in Estonia are contradictory -- on one hand, significant progress has been recognized on the level of research and international competitiveness, while on the other, underfunding and too great a focus on projects are cause for complaint.

In addition to the opinions of researchers, a whole slew of analytical overviews by various research and development activity specialists exists in Estonia, indicating both strengths and weaknesses, as well as partners' predominantly critical statements about links between research and society.

A bystander can easily get the impression that a common position can't be formulated and that everyone praises, complains or criticizes each based on their own point of view. If you take a closer look, however, it is nonetheless possible to understand the sources of various statements and hopefully also offer solutions that stand to serve research and all of society.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, however, we must first begin more generally and attempt to more clearly define research-related concepts.

Research vs. research and development

The public generally understands research to be work done by researchers motivated primarily by curiosity. The ultimate goal of this kind of research and the researchers involved in it is to obtain new knowledge about the world around us -- including nature, humans and society -- as well as make the results available by means of research articles, whose quality, in turn, is assured by peer review, i.e. recognition from others who are experts in the same field. A natural prerequisite for such research is also academic freedom in the choice of one's research.

Parallel to research limited thus, however, exists the considerably broader -- though likewise more vague -- term ""research and development,"" which represents scientific method-based targeted socio-economic activity among other human activity. In modern (science-based?) society, it is precisely broadly-defined research and development activity and the associated innovation that are considered a driver of socio-economic development.

Differences between these concepts are more understandable when one understands the differences in meaning between the English-language terms ""science,"" ""research,"" ""(technological) development"" and ""innovation."" In short, and simply, one can say that they are all based on the scientific method, with differences occurring in the goal of the application of said method and links to other human activities.

Research in the narrower sense described above includes investigator driven frontier research, curiosity driven research and blue skies research, while research and development, or R&D for short (known in British English as research, technological development and innovation, or RTDI) also includes socio-economic strategic research, applied research and experimental development as defined in the OECD's Frascati Manual, which is an internationally recognized and comparable basis for scientific research.

On the basis of the aforementioned, it would probably be more relevant if we used R&D as the English-language equivalent for the Estonian ""uurimis- ja arendustegevus"" [directly translated, ""research and development activity""], not ""teadus- ja arendustegevus"" [directly translated, ""science and development activity""]. To explain the difference: in order to cope with any problem or challenge that arises, one can, but does not have to, do science; it is, however, always wise to first investigate and test things and only thereafter go after a solution. This is why I will henceforth use the acronym R&D in this text, which should help increase comprehension.

Now it will hopefully also be possible to understand claims that the majority of R&D activity is not aimed at publishing, even less so at referencing research articles. University professors and researchers make up a small percentage of people involved in R&D, and the majority of R&D is born of entrepreneurship and in the interest thereof. The OECD estimates that in developed countries, 60 percent of R&D is conducted in business, 20 percent in universities, ten percent in state agencies and ten percent in the nonprofit sector. At the same time, all of the aforementioned does not mean that publicly funded and accessible academic research does not make up the strategically most important and influential (most valuable?) part of R&D. Nobel Prize-winning discoveries shift the boundaries not only of science, but also of civilization; added to these are the results of the primarily curiosity driven senior research conducted by (research) university professors, which reach society by way of articles and university students, but this still represents just the tip of the R&D iceberg.

R&D as a global socio-economic phenomenon, based on the scientific method's ability to increase economic and national competitiveness, is in developed society organically linked to other areas of life, based largely on their needs and serving society primarily by changing the world, not simply explaining it.

One example -- even of the 2,500 employees at CERN, the world-renowned top research center, just three percent are physicists seeking to unlock nature's secrets; 41 percent of employees are applied researchers and engineers, 35 percent are technicians and the remaining 21 percent administrative employees and officials. So it is understandable that the Higgs boson was discovered and internet invented at CERN.

In order to understand the background, it is worth considering how the U.S. and the EU allocates its R&D resources and what global trends exist in R&D funding.

A broad consensus exists that R&D has market failures and thus should be funded by the public sector, but an equal consensus also exists that the private sector should contribute approximately twice as much -- the goal is one percent of the GDP from the public and two percent of the GDP from the private sector. This has been a (formal?) political goal both in the EU and Estonia for more than two decades, although movement in this direction is more than frustrating for both sides (true, Nordic countries are an exception here).

It is worth noting, however, that while the level of public-sector R&D funding in Estonia (approximately 0.8 percent of the GDP) falls short of the goal amount (and is unfortunately decreasing), it is nonetheless at the same level as U.S. funding and among the top five in the EU. What should be cause for concern and consideration is the fact that when it comes to businesses' R&D funding, we fall two to three times short of both Europe and the U.S.

Where does the money go?

Likewise politically significant is where public sector R&D funding is directed. In the U.S., defense research is in first place, accounting for approximately 50 percent of public funding, followed by targeted research (health, energy, space, food, etc.) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the primary source of funding for curiosity driven research, which receives nearly five percent of all federal research budget funding.

Europe's equivalent of the NSF is the European Research Council (ERC), which has a budget of approximately €16 billion, or 20 percent of the EU's nearly €80 billion Research and Innovation program, which is known by the name of Horizon 2020. An analysis evaluating global R&D funding perspectives foresees growth in the coming years in the fields of applied research and technological development, mainly as a result of increasing global economic competition.

It is important to add for the sake of balancing out the aforementioned that a large degree of end users of various R&D-related financial allocations, including those for defense-related R&D, are nonetheless university researchers and engineers who, with the support of and alongside academic research, are involved in scientific (applied) research dedicated to specific objectives.

It is also worth noting that a large degree of the knowledge and technology needed to produce personal computers, iPhones and many other personal devices was produced as a ""side product"" of the U.S.' defense-related R&D activity. It is good to know that Estonian researchers have also been involved in science-related so-called frontier research funded by the U.S.' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Changing policy

Based on the above, it is possible to seek a solution to issues with research highlighted by our own researchers. True, before reaching possible solutions, it would be worth noting a few historical observations.

First of all -- legitimate complaints regarding research funding being largely project-based are the result of the initiative of specifically young researchers in the first years following the reestablishment of Estonia's independence, who opposed the Soviet financial model, which stably distributed money to existing institutions and individuals and did not allow for young people to demonstrate their academic abilities in an honest research project competition.

Second -- changes that have occurred in the organization of research over the past two decades have for the most part been initiated by (more meritorious) scientists themselves, as the business sector and the remaining public sector have proven incapable of voicing their interests and research policy priorities and officials and politicians have, in the interests of keeping the peace, proceeded based first and foremost on the proposals of various research groups and institutions, not enforced some kind of research policy of their own against the wishes of the scientific community. This would lack political logic.

True, these changes have tended to favor strong (project-oriented) researchers with a stronger public position (and an h-index supporting this).

This policy has also led to success -- the majority of Estonian research and researchers have achieved international visibility and been established as top research and top researchers. But this alone isn't enough, if we consider Estonian R&D and in particular its effects on society as a whole, if only a few dozen belong to the top one percent of researchers cited worldwide. Over 5,000 researchers and engineers in the Estonian public sector are involved in R&D, and the majority of their contributions should be more directly linked to society and the economy than simply via articles and university professors.

From problems to solutions

It is necessary to increase R&D funding -- even inevitable in order to move toward increased productivity. But this bottleneck in growth isn't in state funding, but rather in the weakness of R&D in our private sector; if we are at the forefront of state funding in the EU, we are among the last when it comes to private-sector funding. Unfortunately, we don't even have a good overview of the state of R&D in the private sector -- at least, it is not reflected in any reliable form in Statistics Estonia data.

State efforts to remedy the situation with EU funding have intensified links between research and business, but, for example, technology development centers (TAK) established with state support vanished as soon as public funding ceased. Insofar as the disappearing TAKs (including the genetic engineering-promoting ""cancer-TAK"" and materials technology-promoting ""nano-TAK"") apparently had weaker local business support, we have learned the lesson that state R&D funding should first and foremost be directed to where (initial) R&D capacity exists on the market-based level.

On a side note -- general complaints directed at the business sector regarding the lack of involvement of research and researchers are made in vain, as a profit-seeking company will act based on its own economic interests. This is why the joint efforts of researchers and donors should be aimed specifically at jointly increasing economic benefits, rather than satisfying the needs of research itself. Based on the above, the recently launched NUTIKAS program, which encourages cooperation between business activity and universities, is definitely a step in the right direction and should be expanded upon.

Unfortunately, other public sector R&D activity, with the exception of the area of government of the Ministry of Education and Research, is likewise weak. In model countries, a large degree of R&D funding comes from outside of the Ministry of Research and is based on these ministries' fields of interest (e.g. public health, the economy, security). In Estonia, the rate of such funding is many times lower, which is why nearly 60 percent of R&D funding from the Estonian state budget is allocated to promoting research in general (compared to below 30 percent in Finland and below just ten percent in the U.S.).

Such a situation is in part the result of conscious choices (tying research to universities, the restructuring of the Estonian Academy of Sciences and branch research institutions) in order to increase the quality and productivity of R&D, and this was justified during a transition period during which capacity was lacking for socio-economic targeting in R&D. By now it would be wise to follow other states' example and change direction. Herein we must recognize the Ministry of Education and Research's RITA program, which aims at filling this gap.

Too many PhDs?

A solution must be found to another acute problem highlighted first and foremost young researchers -- there are not enough (secure) jobs for new PhDs, and hopes for successful calls for proposals continue to shrink.

Approximately 220 doctoral theses are defended each year in Estonia. When the goal was once set to reach 300 defenses every year, this was based on the assumption that half of these would go on to work outside of universities. In reality, these jobs don't exist, and so the increased pressure on academic jobs is understandable, especially in specialties in which doctoral studies are the most successful (yet for which there is often no demand whatsoever outside of universities).

This issue also clearly point to the need to better coordinate the direction of university research and societal expectations. Further state budget funding of these fields would apparently further exacerbate the problem. This situation bears a striking resemblance to Finland in the 1970s and 80s, when many young people with PhDs were forced to either significantly change fields or else seek employment abroad. In order to avoid exacerbating this issue, we should seriously consider developing a so-called industrial doctorate, in which development engineers or researchers already working in business or the public sector could combine their daily work with doctoral studies at a university, with said studies thereby contributing as directly as possible to development activities and the economy.

It is worth noting here that our (young) researchers are likewise undergoing very painful pressure to change the direction of their research or even their specialty. The primary value of a PhD is not in fact being the most knowledgeable on the world of one's dissertation topic, but rather the acquired ability to master the scientific method. If we take a broader look around, we will see all over the world that even repeatedly switching specialties is the rule rather than the exception.

It is also true that a young researcher must be prepared for this already in the course of their university studies and that, alongside narrowly specialty-focused activity, universities should devote much more attention to developing the necessary personal competencies [in their students].

Promisingly

We can apparently avoid the drop in state budget financing of R&D (in relative to the GDP) -- such a promise was made by the Research and Development Council headed by the prime minister, anyway. Also agreed upon is the direction of its additional funding first and foremost to stable basic funding, which would enable the launch of a modern academic career system.

I know that the understanding -- which, by the way, has been invariably repeated by all external experts to evaluate our R&D system over the past ten years -- that closer ties are necessary between research and Estonian life has also reached the political decision-making level. Now it's time to await decisions and the resources needed to fulfill them. I would like to emphasize the following keywords: financing of applied research on a researcher-engineer (university-business) axis; industrial doctorate; extending the number of fields of research to be funded from four to six, together with the corresponding decision-making mechanisms; increasing ministries' R&D competencies.

In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I will add that the aforementioned in no way constitutes a proposal to abandon current R&D quality criteria -- we still need bright peaks in research and curiosity driven front-line research and the adequate funding thereof. At the same time, research aimed at addressing practical issues should be required to meet equivalent quality requirements -- applied research must be at least as high-quality as, or why not better than, curiosity driven research. And this should be the same in the humanities, natural sciences, engineering sciences, agricultural sciences as well as pedagogy.

At the same time, it is worth paying more attention to the aspect of R&D whose output manifests in increased productivity, increased export potential or simply a better life outside of the walls of the university. Through this, much of the 99 percent which does not fit into the one percent would also find work, pay and recognition. And, most importantly, by getting closer to people and their concerns, general support for researchers and other people involved in R&D would certainly grow, including through funding and jobs."

The Questor Column:

You don't need an accounting degree to see why 4imprint's shares should rise: The firm completes the building of a substantial asset. As a result, the cash generated by its profitable operations is no longer consumed by capital expenditure and instead starts to accumulate in its bank account. Having no business need for this money, it decides to hand it over to shareholders in the form of a special dividend, boosting an already decent yield. The market responds well to news of this surprise payment and sends the share price higher. This, broadly speaking, is what fund managers at Unicorn Asset Management expect to happen at Aim-listed 4imprint, which supplies promotional items such as branded pens and hats largely to the American market. Without the special dividends, the shares currently yield about 2.5%. Another point in the company's favour is its management. They added that 4imprint could ""grow profits and dividends at a double-digit rate - it has in the past and we expect it to do so in future"". The shares have tended to trade at a price-to-earnings ratio in the high teens, ""which we think perfectly warranted and not demanding given this level of growth"". Questor says 'Buy'.

Update: Secure Trust Bank: When we spoke to the Unicorn managers we took the opportunity to get their views on Secure Trust Bank, which Questor tipped as a ""buy"" last year just as post-referendum panic had sent its shares tumbling. The managers pointed out that the bank's recent interim results had demonstrated continued double-digit growth in customer deposits, the loan book and customer numbers, but that the management was increasingly cautious about the domestic economy. As a result, the bank is moving away from higher-margin, higher-risk unsecured consumer lending towards lower-risk secured lending. This has caused the shares to drift lower in recent months. The Unicorn managers said: ""In our view this now represents excellent value for long-term investors, with the market consensus for 2018 putting the company on a price-to-earnings ratio of less than nine and a yield of 5%.""Management clearly agrees - the Chief Executive, Paul Lynam, bought £100,000 worth of shares following the results. We remain supportive long-term holders and also topped up our position last week."" Questor says 'Hold'.

166,166,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) followed the advice of its advisory committee and approved a breakthrough treatment for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on Wednesday. It's the first gene therapy approved in the U.S.

Dr. Carl June, director of the center for cellular immunotherapies at University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center, who pioneered the therapy, was still emotional an hour after receiving the news of the approval in an email.

""It's unbelievable,"" June told TIME, his voice wavering. ""It's an amazing feeling. We worked on it and worked on it and finally to have such a discrete, palpable event like this is such an amazing thing.""

Read more: FDA Panel Recommends Approval of the First Gene Therapy Treatment

June and his team have been developing the treatment, called CAR T cell therapy (for chimeric antigen receptor T cells), for nearly three decades. Also called Kymriah, the treatment isn't actually a drug in the traditional sense, but a collection of the patient's own cells that have been removed from the body and genetically engineered to recognize and destroy cancer cells circulating in the blood. Each treatment is a living drug, a bespoke therapy designed specifically for individual patients.

""This is an ultra-personalized therapy that actually works,"" says June. ""Patients are involved in making their own drug.""

Not only does the approval represent a landmark in being the first green-light for a gene therapy, it marks a sea change in the way cancer can be treated. Until now, treatments have focused on bringing in drugs, surgery or radiation to weaken the cancer. With CAR T cell therapy, the treatment starts from within, by enhancing the body's own immune system to fight cancer with a genetic boost. ""It's a paradigm shift,"" says Dr. Kevin Curran, from the pediatric bone marrow transplantation service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ""These are actually living cells that we pull out of the system, modify in the lab, teach how to find cancer, turn back on and put back into patients. To do that definitely shifts everything.""

And there is hope that the therapy might even provide more cures for leukemia than existing options. The first patient to be treated with CAR T cells is currently in remission seven years after his treatment. ""We now have proof that it is possible to eradicate cancer by harnessing the power of a patient's own immune system,"" Dr. Kenneth Anderson, president of the American Society of Hematology and a physician at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said in a statement. ""This is a potentially curative therapy in patients whose leukemia is unresponsive to other treatments and represents the latest milestone in the shift away from chemotherapy toward precision medicine.""

Novartis, which licensed the technology and made it possible to manufacture the CAR T cells on a larger scale, plans on making Kymriah available at around 30 hospitals nationwide by the end of the year. Because Novartis will have to manufacture each patient's dose individually, for the time being, the therapy will only be available at those facilities.

Read more: What If Your Immune System Could Be Taught to Kill Cancer?

For now, Kymriah is approved only for children with ALL that has failed to respond to existing treatments. But already scientists are studying whether CAR T cells can be effective in other blood cancers and lymphomas, as well as in solid cancers like breast, prostate, ovarian and lung cancers. ""We hope the momentum behind the technology builds as we continue to investigate the abilities of personalized cellular therapeutics in blood cancers and solid tumors to help patients with many other types of cancer,"" said Dr. Stephan Grupp, director of the cancer immunotherapy frontier program at University of Pennsylvania and who led the studies on children with ALL.

June also hopes that as more people receive the therapy, advances in making the cells and distributing the technology will make it more accessible. He likens the process to the first computers, which initially were built manually and took more time, before the process became automated and routine to the point where they could be easily mass-produced. ""Right now there is going to be a limitation to how much Novartis can manufacture until more plants are built and more people are trained,"" he says. ""There will be shortages.""

Read more: Promising New Cancer Treatment Uses Immune Cells

As more people receive the therapy, doctors will also learn more about how to control its most serious side effect: a severe immune reaction known as cytokine release syndrome that requires hospitalization in the intensive care unit. Medications can control the extent of the reaction, but some early patients died of the syndrome.

The therapy's cost will be another issue. Novartis estimates it will cost nearly $500,000, a price tag that patient groups have already criticized and hope to bring down.

Nonetheless, there will indeed be a surge in demand for CAR T cell therapy, as there is with any exciting breakthrough in medicine. ""I think the cancer world is going to be forever changed,"" says June. ""There will be many more of these CAR T cell therapies in the future.""

Hackers have repeatedly targeted Canadian doctors with ransomware recently, hobbling computer systems that hold thousands of medical records and impeding patient care, says a major health-care organization.

In the best-case scenario after the incidents, medical offices spend two or three days restoring their systems from backup sites; at worst they can lose masses of crucial data, says the Canadian Medical Protective Association (CMPA).

In the meantime, physicians are missing key aspects of patientsâ history when diagnosing health issues, says Dr. Dennis Desai, a physician adviser at the CMPA, which provides liability coverage for most of Canadaâs MDs.

âThe doctors are under attack,â he said. âWe are getting physicians on a regular basis saying, âI have a computer, I got locked out, I have ransomware.â â| Theyâve been asked to pay in bitcoin. Theyâre asking us, âShould I pay it?â â

The theoretical threat of ransomware to Canadian health care been much discussed lately, especially since the global âWannacryâ outbreak struck several British hospitals in May.

But the associationâs revelations appear to be the first public acknowledgement of actual patient data in this country being affected by the increasingly common form of cyber crime.

The office of Brian Beamish, Ontarioâs privacy commissioner, said Wednesday that it has also received 10 reports of ransomware attacks on doctorâs offices or clinics since the start of 2016, calling it anÂ âincreasingly dangerousâ threat to the security of health records.

In simple terms, attackers freeze up computers by encrypting data and then demand a payment â"" usually in digital bitcoin â"" to unlock the files. Even if ransom is paid, there is lingering concern about what hackers might do with the data.

No Canadian hospital â"" as opposed to a doctorâs office â"" has publicly admitted to being a victim. But Bill Tholl, chair of a federal committee on cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, confirmed on Wednesday that it has happened here, with medical files involved.

âThere have been some hospitals that have been attacked and have paid ransom in bitcoin, in Canada,â he said. âIt was the Wannacry kind of event â| Itâs not individual patient files; they lock up everybody.â

The CMPA published an article this week urging physicians to ensure they have robust backup systems, vigorously guard against infection by computer viruses â"" and not pay ransom if they are targeted.

It seems to be a burgeoning problem, with one expert estimating the number of ransomware attacks has soared 600 per cent just in the past year, said Tholl, former CEO of HealthCareCan, which represents hospitals and other medical facilities across the country.

And for various reasons, medical data is a prime focus, 10 times more likely to be targeted than even banking information, he said.

That reality was driven home by Wannacry, which caused 16 hospitals in Britainâs National Health Service to shut down at least part of their operations.

In the U.S., at least two major facilities have taken significant hits from more isolated attacks. Most recently, computers at Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo were down for six weeks earlier this year after hackers demanded $44,000 in bitcoin, a sum the facility refused to pay.

Kevin Magee, a cybersecurity consultant who is on Thollâs federal committee, said Canadian hospitals have so far been relatively unscathed, partly because they seem disciplined about installing security patches to protect against malware.

Simple computer âhygieneâ â"" not clicking on suspect links or attachments in emails that can usher viruses into a system â"" is also effective, experts say.

But Wannacry showed cyber criminals the lure of pursuing health-care institutions, where lives could actually be endangered by a sudden computer failure, Magee said.

âIt was an advertisement to hackers to say, âTheyâre ripe for the picking, theyâre a very high probability, low-risk target,â â he said. âThe media coverage is extensive, which provides incredible pressure on the organization to pay.â

Desai said the physician offices affected by ransomware â"" some housing several doctors â"" typically have one computer system that covers everything from appointment scheduling to patient charts. And more than 70 per cent of physicians now have electronic medical records.

Being without those charts even for a couple of days is a problem, he said.

âThe patient comes in with a sore throat and youâre going to prescribe an antibiotic. But (maybe) theyâve got an allergy to penicillin, or they had a previous problem with a cancer and this might be a recurrence,â said Desai. âYou really need to know that information.â

Most offices do have their files backed up, meaning a compromised system can be purged and then restored from other sources, but that can be an arduous process, he said.

The CMPA, like most other experts, advises against paying a ransom, as it may simply set up the clinic to be menaced again, and is no guarantee files will be unlocked, said Desai.

A national policy against hospitals paying ransom would be ideal, but not practical until all the facilities have implemented adequate, daily backup of patient data, said Tholl. Some have yet to take that step.

Meanwhile, the ransomware threat is expected to keep growing, and become increasingly sophisticated, said Magee.

That could mean hackers demanding ransom with more insidious forms of pressure, such as threatening to change blood type or other key facts in patient records, publish private charts or emails, or meddle with computer-connected medical devices, he said.

Tholl said the health-care system, once skeptical of the threat, now takes it very seriously.

A survey done for HealthCareCAN after the Wannacry incident found 85 per cent of those officials felt their institutions were very or somewhat vulnerable to cyber assaults.

170,170,"The Courier-Journal on halting a study on health risks for people living near strip mining sites:

People in Appalachian Kentucky are dying at rates significantly higher than national averages.

We need to better understand why, through scientific research, to begin curing the health crises in the region.

One federally funded study was working on that until the Trump administration's Interior Department turned its back on the region about a week ago when it put the brakes on a $1 million study. Officials say it was part of a budgetary review.

We're skeptical. Scientific research is under siege in this administration, especially when it calls for restrictions that cut into corporate profits.

That National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine study was looking at the potential health risks of people living near mountain strip mining sites in the coal region.

We agree with U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, who said budget priorities are out of whack and putting lives at risk.

Kentucky's other congressional leaders must push back against the president and get this study back on track. It is morally reprehensible to claim to support bringing back coal jobs while people in those mining communities are dying at alarming rates and it's unknown whether mining is contributing to the region's health crisis.

This is a deadly smack in the face for the region that overwhelmingly voted for Trump, and it doesn't make sense.

We need to know if the dust from blasting away the mountain tops is exposing nearby residents to cancer-causing arsenic, cadmium and other dangerous elements. We need to know if the mining is contributing to lung disease, birth defects and cardiovasular disease. We need to know if polluted streams and water supplies are a factor.

What we do know is that the cancer mortality rate in Appalachian Kentucky is 35 percent higher than the national rate. And we know that the region's mortality rate from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is 88 percent higher than the national rate.

And while smoking rates are higher in the region, one peer-reviewed study showed that does not account for increases in cancer and other health issues in mining areas.

Until we know what other factors could be contributing to the region's health problems, nothing can be off the table, including research into the effects of mountaintop strip mining.

We can't ignore earlier studies that have shown higher numbers of birth defects in communities near mountain strip mining and higher rates of kidney disease and lung cancer.

There must be wide scientific research to begin diagnosing what's killing so many in Eastern Kentucky. Anything less is malpractice.

The Lexington Herald-Leader on a trauma doctor who cut opioid prescriptions in half:

In 2013, Dr. Phillip K. Chang had what he calls an ""eye-opening moment.""

Chang had used his prowess as a trauma surgeon at the University of Kentucky to repair a young man's injuries from a vehicle crash, only to have the pain medicine he prescribed leave his patient addicted to opioids.

Many physicians have had that moment. Chang, who saw the pattern repeat in other patients, says it ""could happen to our family, our neighbors, ourselves."" The pain of withdrawal is no less real than the pain of broken bones.

Chang and his team began thinking about less risky ways to treat acute pain, and this weekend he will tell the Kentucky Medical Association how they were able to halve the amount of opiates given to trauma patients without increasing their pain levels.

KMA is dedicating its annual meeting to educating physicians about ways to combat an opioid epidemic that mutated into a heroin boom, claimed 1,404 lives from overdoses in Kentucky last year and put the state in the lead for hepatitis C.

Two developments of the 1990s spurred this crisis: Pain was added as a vital sign by the hospital accrediting commission. And the pharmaceutical industry targeted physicians with aggressive and misleading marketing of opioids, flooding Kentucky with powerful painkillers, many of which were diverted into the black market.

Medicare grades hospitals and bases reimbursements in part on what patients report about their pain control, creating a financial incentive to over-prescribe painkillers. Even among non-surgical hospital patients, half were prescribed opiates in a study of 1.14 million admissions.

Medicare should remove or revise its pain questions on patient surveys. And insurers should save themselves future costs by paying for alternatives to opioid painkillers.

Chang said KASPER, Kentucky's electronic reporting system, alerted him to his patient's doctor-shopping. (Thank you, Congressman Hal Rogers.) In four weeks, someone who had no history of drug abuse when he entered the hospital had been prescribed an alarming number of pills.

With the resources of UK Healthcare at hand, Chang called a drug counselor and they confronted the patient and offered help.

Doctors and hospitals have huge roles in preventing addiction and also avoiding relapse. After just three days of taking prescription painkillers, the risk of chronic opioid use increases and goes up rapidly after that, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Opioid prescribing has declined somewhat in this country but is still greater per capita than in 1999 and almost four times the rate in Europe.

Chang, who last year became UK's chief medical officer, says inpatients are ""super receptive"" when educated about the opioid risk and included in tailoring pain-control regimens, ranging from non-opioids such as Tylenol and Advil to numbing medications that don't deliver opiates to the brain. Chang and his team also are integrating art, music and touch therapies into treating acute pain.

They were able to achieve the same level of pain control with half the amount of opioids. Such success among trauma patients certainly could be replicated in other populations.

Rather than eliminating pain, Chang aims to keep pain ""tolerable"" -- a standard that Medicare should adopt.

Kentucky's legislature this year enacted what Chang calls a ""game changer"" -- a three-day limit on opioid prescriptions for acute (as opposed to chronic) pain. The new law creates opportunities for doctors to educate their patients about non-addictive options.

The opioid crisis demands a well-funded comprehensive plan, including a way to provide treatment on demand. Doctors have a huge role in educating patients and preventing addiction. It's good to see Kentucky's doctors talking about how to meet that responsibility to patients and public.

With summer unofficially over and children back in school, we hope their year is off to a great start. Unfortunately, bullying can ruin it.

While calls about bullying are not as frequent as they were in the past thanks to new policies and procedures, that doesn't mean it no longer exists.

And thanks to technology, it can be hard to always see bullying, especially online. However, children who are being cyberbullied are often bullied in person as well.

Children who are cyberbullied have a harder time getting away from the behavior. It can happen 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and reach a child even when he or she is alone. It can happen any time of the day or night.

Parents need to be aware. Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it's not happening. With new social media apps appearing daily, it can be hard for parents and adults to keep up with it all.

Talk with your children about cyberbullying and other online issues regularly. Here are a few tips:

. Know the sites your children visit and their online activities. Ask where they're going, what they're doing and who they're doing it with.

. Tell your children that as a responsible parent you may review their online communications if you think there is reason for concern. Installing parental control filtering software, or monitoring programs, is one option for monitoring your child's online behavior, but do not rely solely on these tools.

. Have a sense of what they do online and in texts. Learn about the sites they like. Try out the devices they use.

. Ask for their passwords, but tell them you'll only use them in case of emergency.

. Ask to ""friend"" or ""follow"" your children on social media sites or ask another trusted adult to do so.

. Encourage your children to tell you immediately if they, or someone they know, is being cyberbullied. Explain that you will not take away their computers or cellphones if they confide in you about a problem they are having.

When cyberbullying happens, it is important to document and report the behavior so it can be addressed. Cyberbullying often violates the terms of service established by social media sites and internet service providers. Depending on the circumstances, law enforcement may need to be contacted.

We hope these tips won't be needed. However, if you need more resources, visit stopbullying.gov.

172,172,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) followed the advice of its advisory committee and approved a breakthrough treatment for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on Wednesday. It's the first gene therapy approved in the U.S.

Dr. Carl June, director of the center for cellular immunotherapies at University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center, who pioneered the therapy, was still emotional an hour after receiving the news of the approval in an email.

""It's unbelievable,"" June told TIME, his voice wavering. ""It's an amazing feeling. We worked on it and worked on it and finally to have such a discrete, palpable event like this is such an amazing thing.""

Read more: FDA Panel Recommends Approval of the First Gene Therapy Treatment

June and his team have been developing the treatment, called CAR T cell therapy (for chimeric antigen receptor T cells), for nearly three decades. Also called Kymriah, the treatment isn't actually a drug in the traditional sense, but a collection of the patient's own cells that have been removed from the body and genetically engineered to recognize and destroy cancer cells circulating in the blood. Each treatment is a living drug, a bespoke therapy designed specifically for individual patients.

""This is an ultra-personalized therapy that actually works,"" says June. ""Patients are involved in making their own drug.""

Not only does the approval represent a landmark in being the first to green-light a gene therapy, it marks a sea change in the way cancer can be treated. Until now, treatments have focused on bringing in drugs, surgery or radiation to weaken the cancer. With CAR T cell therapy, the treatment starts from within, by enhancing the body's own immune system to fight cancer with a genetic boost.

And there is hope that the therapy might even provide more cures for leukemia than existing options. The first patient to be treated with CAR T cells is currently in remission seven years after his treatment. ""The approval of CAR T-cell therapy for pediatric leukemia marks an important shift in the blood cancer treatment paradigm,"" Dr. Kenneth Anderson, president of the American Society of Hematology and a physician at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said in a statement. ""We now have proof that it is possible to eradicate cancer by harnessing the power of a patient's own immune system. This is a potentially curative therapy in patients whose leukemia is unresponsive to other treatments and represents the latest milestone in the shift away from chemotherapy toward precision medicine.""

Novartis, which licensed the technology and made it possible to manufacture the CAR T cells on a larger scale, plans on making Kymriah available at around 30 hospitals nationwide by the end of the year. Because Novartis will have to manufacture each patient's dose individually, for the time being, the therapy will only be available at those facilities.

Read more: What If Your Immune System Could Be Taught to Kill Cancer?

For now, Kymriah is approved only for children with ALL that has failed to respond to existing treatments. But already scientists are studying whether CAR T cells can be effective in other blood cancers and lymphomas, as well as in solid cancers like breast, prostate, ovarian and lung cancers. ""We hope the momentum behind the technology builds as we continue to investigate the abilities of personalized cellular therapeutics in blood cancers and solid tumors to help patients with many other types of cancer,"" said Dr. Stephan Grupp, director of the cancer immunotherapy frontier program at University of Pennsylvania and who led the studies on children with ALL.

June also hopes that as more people receive the therapy, advances in making the cells and distributing the technology will make it more accessible. He likens the process to the first computers, which initially were built manually and took more time, before the process became automated and routine to the point where they could be easily mass-produced. ""Right now there is going to be a limitation to how much Novartis can manufacture until more plants are built and more people are trained,"" he says. ""There will be shortages.""

Read more: Promising New Cancer Treatment Uses Immune Cells

As more people receive the therapy, doctors will also learn more about how to control its most serious side effect: a severe immune reaction known as cytokine release syndrome that requires hospitalization in the intensive care unit. Medications can control the extent of the reaction, but some early patients died of the syndrome.

The therapy's cost will be another issue. While Novartis won't specify how much the CAR T cells will cost, some have estimated the price tag would be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Nonetheless, there will indeed be a surge in demand for CAR T cell therapy, as there is with any exciting breakthrough in medicine. ""I think the cancer world is going to be forever changed,"" says June. ""There will be many more of these CAR T cell therapies in the future.""

173,173,"Norbert Blum's solve for the infamous 'P vs NP' problem ""passes many filters of seriousness,"" but does it hold up?

This article originally appeared on Motherboard Germany. Since its original publication it has been updated with new information by Motherboard US.

What do curable cancer, fair capitalism, and the perfect game of Super Mario Bros. all have in common? Per a mathematical theory, the solution to any one of these problems would allow us to quickly solve the others. All that's needed are better algorithms to prove that complicated questions -- such as protein folding, efficient marketplaces, and combinatorial analyses -- are merely variations of simpler problems that supercomputers are already able to solve.

But how can one algorithm simplify extremely complicated problems? That depends on another question: What if complicated problems are really just simple problems in disguise? This riddle remains one of the biggest unsolved questions of modern mathematics, and is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, for which every accepted answer is rewarded with one million dollars.

Now, a German man named Norbert Blum has claimed to have solved the above riddle, which is properly known as the P vs NP problem. Unfortunately, his purported solution doesn't bear good news. Blum, who is from the University of Bonn, claims in his recently published 38-page paper that P does not equal NP. In other words, complicated problems are fundamentally different than straightforward problems and it doesn't look like our high-performance computers will be able to crack these most difficult problems anytime in the near future. And in the days since his paper was published, numerous mathematicians have begun to raise questions about whether Blum solved it at all.

Most computer scientists tend to agree with Blum's conclusion. Hard problems are hard, easy problems are easy.

In computer science, easy problems usually fall under the banner of P. This means that they can be solved in ""polynomial time,"" which is a lot like saying that they can be solved in a reasonable period of time. Much more difficult are the NP problems, which computers are unable to solve in a reasonable time frame. For practical purposes, NP problems might as well just be unsolvable by computers. (Note, however, that NP stands for ""nondeterministic polynomial time"" rather than ""not polynomial"" time.)

Here are some examples of NP problems:

Protein folding: The process through which proteins in a biological organism obtain their structure. Better insight into this process could help us recognize or even hinder mutations, which could cure certain forms of cancer.

Optimized routefinding: An optimized travel route through 15 different cities without visiting the same city twice? A hard nut to crack, even for a supercomputer, which is why this is also considered an NP problem in computer science.

The perfect chess game: A game of chess has infinite possible moves, such that even a supercomputer with incredible capacity cannot determine a perfect tactic. Many mathematicians consider this problem so difficult that they don't deem it an NP problem, but rather consider it completely out of the realm of possibility.

All of these complex problems have one thing in common: As difficult as it may be to find a solution to NP problems, it's relatively easy to check the validity of the solutions once you have them.

These two categorical distinctions in problem complexity have origins before the societal rise of home computers. In the 1970s, when computers still were the size of a clunky fridge, it was quickly determined that not all of mankind's problems could be simply solved by those machines. It was proposed that the distinction could be formalized in terms of computational complexity, leading to a suite of complexity classes, including N and NP.

Since of the formal definition of P and NP in 1971, computer scientists have debated whether or not it would be possible to come up with an algorithm capable of reducing or redefining NP problems such that they can be solved in polynomial time. Should someone be able to prove that all NP problems are ultimately just variations of P problems, then all NP problems would essentially be subject to the same form of reduction. In other words, whoever knows the perfect Super Mario Bros. tactic could also cure cancer.

In total, 116 of the bravest in their field have officially attempted to solve this mystery (though untold more computer scientists have posted would-be solutions to messageboards and on sites like arXiv). To date, none of these proofs have officially been recognized by the mathematics community.

In 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI), located in Oxford, compiled a list of seven unsolved Millennium Prize Problems, pledging one million dollars for each solution. It's a sort of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? or X Prize for mathematicians.

The Millennium Prize Problems are considered exceptionally difficult even in expert circles. A wealth of field-specific knowledge is necessary to even understand the questions. The only Millennium Prize Problem solved to date is the Poincaré conjecture, which is not easily explained as an aside in an article about a different mathematics concept.

Solving the NP problem wouldn't be an altogether good thing. For example, most encryption is based on the difficulty of factoring very large prime numbers. Integer factorization is a class NP problem. A 256-bit code, such as the ones financial institutions use in online credit card payments, is considered unbreakable, and thus very safe. Should someone prove that NP does equal P, banks would have to quickly come up with a different security method.

Since Blum's paper was published, mathematicians and computer scientists worldwide have been racking their brains as to whether the Bonn-based researcher has, in fact, solved this Millennium Prize Problem. After an initially positive reaction, such as the one from Stanford mathematician Reza Zadeh, doubts are beginning to arise about whether Blum's reasoning is correct.

In a forum for theoretical mathematics, a user named Mikhail reached out to Alexander Razborov -- the author of the paper on which Blum's proof is based -- to ask him about Blum's paper. Razborov purports to have discovered an error in Blum's paper: Blum's main argument contradicts one of Razborov's key assumptions. And mathematician Scott Aaronson, who is something of an authority in the math community when it comes to P vs. NP, said he would be willing to bet $200,000 that Blum's mathematical proof won't endure.

""Please stop asking,"" Aaronson writes. If the proof hasn't been refuted, ""you can come back and tell me I was a closed-minded fool.""

In the week since Aaronson's initial blog post, other mathematicians have begun trying to poke holes in Blum's proof. Dick Lipton, a computer science professor at Georgia Tech, wrote in a blog post that Blum's proof ""passes many filters of seriousness,"" but suggested there may be some problems with it. A commenter on that blog post, known only as ""vloodin,"" noted that there was a ""single error on a subtle point"" in the proof; other mathematicians have since chimed in and confirmed vloodin's initial analysis, and so the emerging consensus among many mathematicians is that a solve for P vs. NP remains elusive.

SAN JOSE, Calif. & SEATTLE, Aug 30, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Labcyte Inc. and SEngine Precision Medicine today announced the companies are collaborating to fulfill the promise of personalized medicine by employing Labcyte's advanced acoustic liquid handling solutions with SEngine's unique functional drug testing approach with the mission to match cancer patients to the most effective and least toxic therapies available.

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170830005430/en/

SEngine employs functional genomics and robotic testing of drugs in live patient organoids using the company's CLIA-certified P.A.R.I.S. assay. From a single sample taken from a patient's tumor, SEngine scientists can discover which drugs or combinations of drugs are most effective in killing or disabling that individual's cancer, and which therapies will most likely not work in a specific case - saving patients time, money, and unnecessary side effects. The test employs more than 100 drugs, carefully selected to include the largest and most up-to-date collection of targeted therapies, and is applicable to all major solid tumor types.

Labcyte's Echo® Liquid Handlers use the gentle energy of sound waves to transfer liquids with high accuracy and billionth of a liter precision.

176,176,"IBM's Watson artificial intelligence project is probably a whole lot bigger than you ever imagined.

In 2011, IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Watson artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer beat 74-time-straight Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings in a man-vs.-machine showdown on primetime television. ""Winning"" $77,147 to Jennings' $24,000, Watson arguably proved itself three times as intelligent as his human opponent. In so doing, IBM ushered in the new age of AI, in which humans no longer work for food, and computers do all of our thinking for us.

Oh, wait. That actually didn't happen.

But in the six years since Watson beat Jennings on Jeopardy!, IBM's AI wunderkind has been in the news plenty. Among other projects, Watson has been tasked with tackling two of humanity's biggest challenges: helping Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) figure out a cure for cancer and navigating the U.S. tax code for H&R Block (NYSE: HRB). Yet what exactly Watson is remains something of a mystery to many. In an attempt to get a better handle on Watson, I posed a some questions via email to IBM Vice President Ed Harbour, head of the IBM Watson project.

Here's what he had to say. The interview has been edited to aid clarity and brevity.

Rich Smith: What is Watson, exactly? Is it code? Is it servers? What is the clearest way a layman can envision Watson?

Ed Harbour: Watson is the AI platform for business. It is not one thing, but rather a collection of services and capabilities that include machine learning, reasoning, and decision technologies, as well as language, speech, and vision technologies. These capabilities are designed to learn at scale, reason with purpose, and interact with humans naturally to solve a wide range of practical problems, boost productivity, and foster new discoveries across many industries.

Watson can turn business data -- even data that is unstructured -- into actionable insights that enhance decision-making. Watson can take many forms, from virtual assistant to care manager, research module to customer service agent. Watson leverages the IBM Cloud, offering access to an unprecedented set of enterprise-grade cloud services that can further enhance its function to meet various business needs.

Smith: How does Watson differ from more familiar forms of AI such as Apple's Siri and Amazon.com's Alexa?

Harbour: Watson and Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa do totally different things. Their foundation is quite basic and just speech to text to search. Watson delivers a conversation; it delivers answers, alternatives, and evidence-based recommendations with confidence. It learns from interactions and expert training, grows and develops over time. In addition to answers, it offers alternatives and background on why it made the decisions it recommends to users. Watson retains conversations and can understand context and domain. Watson is an AI platform for the enterprise.

Other forms of AI, like Siri or Alexa, rely solely on Q&A and speech to text. They use pre-compiled, human-curated databases or FAQs to look up keywords, as do search engines like Google. Consumer data is not where most of the value is. Eighty percent of the world's data is not on the Web, but rather embedded in businesses and industries, such as client data, financial data, and medical data. Our approach is to build cognitive solutions to help specific industries and businesses tap this data. A key aspect is Watson protects clients' data and any business insights. This is not shared. Watson is also deployed on the IBM Cloud and can be scaled to meet any enterprise needs.

For example, in the case of IBM client H&R Block, Watson was enlisted to understand the ""language"" of tax to provide the most personalized tax-preparation experience. Watson, with the Tax Professional, helped ensure that consumers were getting the best possible tax outcome and also made the entire tax return process a more collaborative, transparent experience. The main differentiator with Watson is the actionable capability and insights it brings to enterprise clients.

Smith: What would you say is the public's biggest misperception about Watson? What is one thing that folks might think that Watson can do that it actually cannot?

Harbour: The biggest misperception about Watson is that it's meant to replace humans. Watson works with humans to enhance the abilities of professionals at every level, from highly specialized surgeons to oil drillers, and automates many basic tasks. However, no matter how advanced the technology, some jobs -- specifically, those that rely heavily on empathy, ethical judgment, and social interaction -- will always be performed better by humans.

Cognitive computing introduces a new level of collaboration between man and machine. It will augment and expand human intelligence, not replace it.

Smith: Can you name one concrete example of something you would like Watson to be able to do that it cannot quite manage yet?

Harbour: The future of technology is rooted in artificial intelligence. In the next three to five years, you'll see advancements that crack the uniquely human nature of communication. For example, Watson has started to be able to detect facial expressions, to combine words, voice, and visual interfaces and form a complete understanding of a conversation. IBM is also further developing Watson's ability to understand different vocalizations of words and how that reinforces a person's emotional meaning.

The true value of Watson and cognitive systems is how it can augment and amplify human abilities. To help us think and perform our jobs better, faster, not to do it for us.

Smith: How human is Watson right now? Would it be possible for someone to interview Watson about Watson?

Harbour: Watson is trained on specific data sets to unearth insights into different industries, tasks, and specialties. Once trained, with its speech, language, and intelligence capabilities, Watson can learn and understand the intention behind a specific command and provide a refined answer for the specific industry or profession it was trained to help.

While it's technically possible to train Watson to answer questions about its own technology, unlike humans, Watson does not have a personality, so it may not make for the most engaging interview subject.

Smith: How does Watson get smarter? By adding data? By refining algorithms? Both?

Harbour: Watson technologies are trained by humans to understand information specific to different industries, specialties, and languages -- in other words, Watson learns in an expert way, not just a general way. This involves training the system to recognize patterns by feeding it large amounts of labeled data and then working with human experts to refine the answers. Through successive rounds of input and feedback from subject-matter experts, Watson's understanding and responses improve.

Looking at the implementation of specific Watson technologies -- Natural Language Understanding and Tone Analyzer are designed to allow developers to quickly bake these functionalities into their apps and see value, without a consultant. Watson Conversation Service enables powerful engagement, and Watson Discovery Service allows for unearthing powerful insights often distributed over vast amounts of documents. Even more robust services like Watson Virtual Agent -- a customer-service chatbot -- come pre-trained with over 105 intents and 35,000 utterances and ready for domains such as general customer service, telco, and retail banking. We also built Watson Knowledge Studio, which allows clients to train Watson on the language of their industry, profession, and domain -- easily. We are continually improving and refining the various underlying algorithms that power the Watson platform.

Smith: How expensive is it for a client to use Watson? How is it billed?

Harbour: Our approach to delivering Watson is flexible and tailored to the clients with both industry solutions and APIs available on the IBM Cloud.

We have several business models for Watson. The overarching theme is value-based. It's really focused on driving scale.

Smith: Can you quantify how important Watson is to IBM's business today, in terms of the revenue it produces?

Harbour: Watson is part of our analytics business in our cognitive-solutions segment. In 2Q17, we reported that revenues in this segment grew to $4.6 billion. Over the last 12 months, our strategic imperatives, which includes analytics, has delivered $34.1 billion in revenue, 43% of IBM's total revenue.

Another good indicator of where we are in the cognitive journey is to look at scaling, where we started and where we are now. Watson was just a natural-language machine six years ago. If you want to think of it in terms of a human, it could only ""hear"" or ""read"" and only basic information at that.

Today, Watson has grown from that one natural-language QA API into a multitude of services. It has gone from simply speaking English to understanding nine languages. We've added more capabilities and have built extensive data sets industry by industry to train Watson to solve complex industry problems.

It not only can reason over simple trivia; it can reason through complex industry-specific data, like cybersecurity data or cancer data. And it not only ""reads."" It can ""see."" Watson can look at medical images and flag ones for radiologists that are unusual -- and it can understand emotion and tone, too.

These capabilities are being deployed in enterprises faster. For example, you mentioned cancer research. Watson took a couple of years to learn about oncology after its Jeopardy! win in 2011. But look where we are today. We've entered clinical use in 12 countries and are expanding to more countries later this year. Watson so far has been trained on six types of cancer, with plans to add several more this year.

On taxes, we started with H&R Block last summer. It took us a few months to build a solution for them, and this year somewhere in the ballpark of 11 million people did their taxes at an H&R Block office, powered by Watson.

Another metric of success is embedding Watson across the IBM portfolio. That's our mission. We've been describing Watson as a sliver thread, weaving through multiple areas and segments. We're helping colleagues across our portfolio embed Watson into existing offerings. We've been successful in security, commerce, technology services, and systems, to name a few.

Smith: In addition to cancer and taxes, you are also using Watson to provide individual health and fitness insights to more than 190 million users of Under Armour's connected-fitness platform, while simultaneously providing traffic information to Chevy, Buick, and GMC drivers through General Motors' OnStar service. Is there a limit on the amount of juggling Watson can do, working for so many customers simultaneously?

Harbour: Each client gets their own ""instance"" of Watson to train with their data, to meet their needs. We can scale to any number by deploying on the IBM Cloud. The applications for this technology are limitless, and we expect to help more than 1 billion people this year.

We are continuously working to advance this adoption -- drawing more developers to use cognitive engines like Watson to build their own apps, working with more businesses and industries so they can incorporate cognitive solutions into their workflows.

Smith: Put Watson in context versus other AIs. How does it stack up against the competition today?

Harbour: IBM has a significant lead in the industry in applying AI technology, having been researching, developing, and investing in AI technology for more than 50 years. We also have the largest industrial research organization in the world and in 2016 led the industry in AI-related patents held.

Unlike other technologies in the market today that are in the experimental or elementary stage, Watson is a mature platform making a real impact on the industries it touches. Watson solutions are now being built, used, and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries, solving big, complex societal problems, like cancer and cybersecurity. IBM has also made meaningful progress in other industries, ranging from education to commerce.

Smith: And now look 10 years into the future. What are the chances that in 2027, the average consumer will be able to use Watson in daily life?

Harbour: There's a chance that you use Watson already. For example, in addition to people taking their W-2s to H&R Block for cognitive interviews, people may be using Watson when ordering office supplies from Staples, interacting with a gift concierge via 1-800-Flowers' Gwyn system, checking auto recall and warranty information via Honda's ""Ask Dave"" interface, or interacting with Harman/IBM-powered smart rooms.

In the healthcare space, Watson is about more than just cancer treatment. It's available to more than 200 million patients globally, collaborating with doctors, helping improve treatment recommendations and helping deliver more efficient care.

AI is playing a bigger and bigger role in consumers' day-to-day lives. By the end of this year, IBM Watson will be available to more than a billion consumers of all kinds, helping them discover the right insurance options, make travel reservations, troubleshoot their IT, answer weather-related questions, get faster service from their bank, and more."

10 stocks we like better than IBM

When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*

David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and IBM wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys."
178,178,"It predates the first story generating machine demonstrated by Sheldon Klein in 1971 by almost a decade

A computer program developed using an IBM 650 in the 1960s was writing short stories more than 40 years before the firm's Watson AI took centre stage.

The story generating machine was the creation of linguistics expert Joseph E Grimes, who developed the system at a university in Mexico.

Most academics recognise the 'automatic novel writer' demonstrated by Sheldon Klein in 1971 as the first story generating machine.

A rediscovered magazine piece, written for IBM's in-house journal in 1963, pushes back this narrative by almost a decade.

Scroll down for video

In the early 1960s, linguist Joseph E. Grimes (right) programmed an IBM computer (left), at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, to generate stories in natural language prose, using simple English or Spanish

IBM 650: HOW DID IT WORK?

The IBM 650 Magnetic Drum Data-Processing Machine is one of IBM's early computers, and the world's first mass-produced computing systems.

Announced in 1953, almost 2,000 systems were produced with the last rolling out in 1962.

It was able to store just just 20,000 digits at 2,000 addresses on its memory, stored on a rotating magnetic drum

An upgrade in in 1956 allowed users to add an additional four tape disk storage units, expanding the system's memory.

Programs could be stored on punchcards which would were written and read through a separate module for the machine.

Dr Grimes' work, which took place at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, was uncovered by James Ryan of the University of California Santa Cruz.

It began in 1960 or 1961 and came to the attention of IBM Mexico who, according to reports in The Register, sent Life Magazine photographer Cornell Capa and a journalist along to write the piece.

According to the original article, Dr Grimes used a fairy tale pattern based on the 'rules of folk tales' published by soviet folklorist Vladimir Propp in his 1928 work the Morphology of the Folktale.

The computer was programmed to take these building blocks and generate a narrative by randomly piecing them together.

It could generate short stories in both simple English and Spanish.

One of the stories produced by the machine read: 'A lion has been in trouble for a long time.

'A dog steals something that belongs to the lion.

'The hero, lion, kills the villain, dog, without a fight.

'The hero, lion, thus is able to get his possession back.'

As well as a massive breakthrough for computing, the stories allowed Dr Grimes to further his work in the field of linguistics.

Dr Grimes (left) used machine his generated tales as instruments in the linguistics field task of documenting the Huichol language, indigenous to Mexico, with native speakers (right)

The computer was programmed to take basic building blocks of folk stories and generate a narrative by randomly piecing them together. Pictured is one example of the machine's output

He used them to document the Huichol language, indigenous to Mexico.

By observing when readers stumbled over details of the plot, he was able to work out details of the underlying linguistic system

Dr Grimes later reworked his program to function on an IBM 1401.

Eventually he abandoned the project altogether because the stories were 'all boring'.

Almost 50 years later IBM's Watson AI hit the headlines when it appeared on the US TV show Jeopardy! in 2008.

It competed against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, two of the most successful contestants on the show, easily beating them.

It has since been adapted to a variety of real-world applications, notably in the world of finance and business.

WHAT CAN'T WATSON DO?

Watson already has won a major TV game show, is looking for a cure for cancer and has ambitious gastronomy ambitions including devising a recipe for chocolate-beef burritos.

The IBM supercomputer is becoming a jack of all trades for the US tech giant -- including in its new role as a business consultant and analyst for various industries by using massive Internet databases.

IBM has developed a Watson Engagement Advisor application to counsel members of the military and their families how to smartly manage shifting to life after the service.

In the oil and gas sector, IBM has worked with the British tech group Arria to integrate Watson's capabilities to help improve management of leaks in refineries.

Watson has teamed with Elemental Path, maker of 'smart toys,' such as a dinosaur that can tell stories and answer questions from children.

The computer has in its memory thousands of recipes from 'Bon Appetit' magazine, and it also knows the chemical properties of foods.

If Watson suggests marrying strawberries with mushrooms, it's because the two foods share a chemical bond."
179,179,"Nigerian neuroscientist Oshiorenoya Agabi may have found a way to solve one of life's puzzling dilemmas: how to make air travel pleasant again.

What if you could skip tedious airport security lines, while a special device able to sniff out explosives works silently in the background?

This is only one of the possible uses of what Agabi says is the world's first neurotechnology device developed by his Silicon Valley-based start-up Koniku and unveiled at the TEDGlobal conference in Tanzania Sunday.

While those in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are working furiously to create machines that can mimic the brain, or - like tech entrepreneur Elon Musk - implant computers in our brains, Agabi has found a way to merge lab-grown neurons with electronic circuitry.

As many grapple with the finite processing power of silicon, the 38-year-old said he had looked to the brain which is ""the most powerful processor the universe has ever seen.""

To simulate the power of just 204 brain neurons would require a supercomputer, he said.

""Instead of copying a neuron, why not just take the biological cell itself and use it as it is? That thought is radical. The consequence of this is mind-boggling,"" he said.

So he and a team of geneticists, physicists, bio-engineers, molecular biologists and others set about doing just that, focusing on the problems that were particularly hard for silicon devices to solve.

This includes detecting volatile chemicals and explosives or even illnesses such as cancer.

'A world first'

Agabi said the Koniku Kore device is ""a world first"" and able to do just that, essentially through breathing in and smelling the air.

He said ""major brands"", including those in the travel industry, had signed up and the start-up's current revenues of $8 million (EUR 7 million) were expected to leap to $30 million by 2018.

One of the main challenges was finding a way to keep the neurons alive, a secret Agabi did not wish to expand on, saying only they could be kept alive for two years in a lab environment and two months in the device.

As AI improves in leaps and bounds, scientists are trying to make and succeeding in making machines more like our brains, able to learn and understand their surroundings: a prospect that is terrifying for many.

Musk, who has repeatedly warned about the perils of AI making humans obsolete, is working on a new project to implant ""neural lace"" brain-interface technology to prevent humans becoming like a ""house cat"" to potential machine masters.

However, Agabi, who grew up in Lagos where he helped his mother sell food on the streets, believes the future of AI lies in making machines more alive.

He believes his company could build a cognitive humanoid system based on synthetic living neurons in the next five to seven years.

""It's not science fiction,"" he told AFP.

""We want to build a brain of biological neurons - an autonomous system that has intelligence. We do not want to build a human brain.""

Agabi did a bachelors degree in theoretical physics in Lagos before taking an interest in neuroscience and bio-engineering for his PhD in London.

African innovation at TED

He spoke at the opening session of the four-day TEDGlobal conference, putting African ideas, innovation and creativity in the spotlight with a variety of speakers who each get an 18-minute window to get across their message of choice.

A Stanford University dropout wants to change blood testing with a machine that promises precise results from a fingerprick.

This is not the story of turtleneck-wearing Elizabeth Holmes's Theranos Inc. -- which soared to fame and then just as spectacularly crashed to Earth two years ago. With this new startup, some investors believe, things will be different.

Tanay Tandon and co-founder Deepika Bodapati, who dropped out of the University of Southern California, have raised $3.7 million from investors led by venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital to kickstart their company, Athelas, named for the healing plant in ""The Lord of the Rings."" The founders, who are 20 and 22, respectively, say that their portable blood analyzer, a black cylinder that looks a lot like v.'s device, can run a complete blood-cell count from a fingerprick test done at home.

Tandon said he's learned from the collapse of Theranos, which attained a $9 billion valuation and fawning press coverage despite sharing little about how its technology actually worked. When Theranos's innovations proved illusory, its value cratered as investors fled.

""Theranos proved there was clear interest in the space -- it would have been a great company if it worked,"" he said. ""Now, investors say they need proof before we can raise money.""

Seeking approval

Athelas has published initial data comparing traditional laboratory results to its technology, which captures high-resolution images of a blood sample, then uses a computer to tag and count the cells. Its process relies on machine learning. Tandon amassed thousands of images of blood cells labeled by pathologists and fed them to computers to train them to distinguish between different types of cells, which he says will have greater precision than standard testing.

The company has submitted data to the US Food and Drug Administration and hopes to receive clearance this year verifying that its technology produces results equivalent to blood drawn from a vein and tested on industry-standard equipment.

For now, its device can be used by patients for medical decisions as long as a pathologist verifies any test results. Gaining clearance from the FDA would allow Athelas to sell its device over the counter, according to Tandon.

Early believers include two major pharmaceutical companies that have signed deals to explore Athelas's device as a test to help find more patients for their white blood cell-boosting drugs, said Tandon, who declined to name the companies.

Alfred Lin, the Sequoia partner advising Athelas, envisions the product being used in emergency rooms, becoming as ubiquitous as a thermometer.

""Our thesis is it will get adopted because it will drive costs down and provide a better customer experience,"" said Lin. ""Time will tell.""

Wary doctors

Until insurers agree to cover the cost, patients will have to pay $20 a month for the home-testing service. Athelas plans to first focus on cancer patients, who need frequent blood draws to monitor white blood cell counts, which show the immune system's strength. Tandon said he hopes oncologists will recommend the device to patients.

Doctors interviewed by Bloomberg News were intrigued but had reservations. Cancer patients typically need to get their white blood cell counts measured before starting a round of chemotherapy. Being able to test before traveling for a treatment could prevent hassle.

""It's pretty demoralizing to get into the car, drive three hours to be told your blood count's too low, please come back next week,"" said Scott Kopetz, an associate professor of medical oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. ""Reducing those cases could be a benefit.""

White blood cell counts are critical when cancer patients develop a fever, because a low count means they're vulnerable to infection, according to Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. However, Brawley says he'd typically tell such patients to come into the hospital anyway, so Athelas's device wouldn't save them a trip.

Patients ""could just collapse on you, so we have to figure out their white count before we let them leave,"" Brawley said.

Beyond the matter of convenience, if Athelas doesn't integrate seamlessly into existing electronic medical-record systems, most doctors would reject it because they don't want to deal with separate software, said Kopetz. Bypassing a clinic visit may also hurt a doctor's bottom line.

""My business manager would be upset because we can't charge the patient for that visit,"" said Brawley.

Peter Eisenberg, an oncologist at Marin Cancer Care in California, said the current lack of insurance coverage was a dealbreaker for him. ""I'm not going to tell patients to buy anything if their insurance doesn't cover it,"" he said. For a patient who lives in a remote area, ""yeah, sure, put one in that patient's home,"" he said. ""But there's no burning need at all."""

184,184,"Software programming, algorithm development and other technological skills can give scientists an edge in their fields.

Karthik Ram had to reinvent himself in 2009, as have many other scientists in this data-driven age. When he started his postdoctoral work on how climate change affects elk in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, he thought of himself as an ecologist. But interpreting data from satellites and the tracking collars used to follow the animals pushed him to expand that mindset.

To make sense of the shifting ecosystem, he had to hone his programming and learn how to manage mountains of information -- skills that have changed the way he views himself and his career. ""I use the term 'ecologist' less and less often,"" he says. ""Now, I mainly call myself a data scientist.""

Data science was a young field in 2009, but it has quickly matured, and now intersects with many disciplines. Although its definition varies, data science generally involves using computing tools to manage and interpret large data sets.

Ram, now at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley, works with former neuroscientists, social scientists and biologists who have also moved into the world of data. ""Everyone at the institute is like me,"" he says. ""We have computational skills and statistical skills that we can bring to bear on our particular fields.""

The demand for data scientists has expanded beyond academia to industry, health care, government and any institution that generates complex information. IBM projects that there could be more than 2.7 million US jobs in data science and analytics by 2020, a 15% increase from 2015. Numbers are similar in Europe, according to the European Data Science Academy, a training and education group that identifies and collects job advertisements in Europe seeking data-science skills. The academy has identified more than 3 million such ads since 2015, including 290,000 posted during a 3-month period this year.

For those seeking a data-scientist role, the challenge isn't so much finding a job, but finding the best position for their aptitudes and interests (see 'Dig into the data world'). Identifying ""the right fit can be tricky"", says Amelia Taylor, a former tenure-track mathematician at Colorado College in Colorado Springs and now a data scientist for Zymergen, a company based in Emeryville, California, that is developing new uses for genetically engineered microbes. ""Data science can look very different at different places. There are so many companies out there, it's hard to know which ones to look at.""

Too many options -- when many PhD holders in other fields are facing too few -- is a good problem to have. Scientists who develop the right skills and understand their opportunities can expect a rewarding, data-driven future.

The rising tide of data science has lifted many boats. Along with a surge in 'data-scientist' searches, 'data engineer' and 'data analyst' are also popular terms on job-search boards. The differences in these roles are subtle but important. ""The core skill of a data engineer is building robust systems that won't fail,"" explains Marc Warner, chief executive at ASI Data Science, a London-based firm that offers consulting services and a data-science fellowship programme with industry placements.

One key difference between data scientists and analysts, he says, is that scientists tend to follow data where they lead them -- a 'data-first' approach -- whereas analysts generally use numbers to test an established hypothesis.

At the London-based Alan Turing Institute (ATI), Mihaela van der Schaar lets data lead the way. She develops computer algorithms to help personalize treatments, prognoses and risk predictions for patients. ""I believe that such techniques can transform medicine, save lives and enable scientific breakthroughs,"" she says.

Founded in 2015 by five UK universities and the nation's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council in an effort to spawn collaborations with industry and government, the ATI embodies the interdisciplinary spirit of data science, van der Schaar says. She adds that some of the biggest and most interesting problems in data science come from unexpected places. ""One of the projects that I am most involved with currently at ATI aims to develop better methods to understand and treat cystic-fibrosis patients,"" she says. ""This comes from neither the industry nor the government, but through a partnership with the UK Cystic Fibrosis Trust.""

Interdisciplinary connections also form the foundation of Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments, an initiative that has created data-science centres at the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Washington in Seattle and New York University. Each centre gathers data scientists from a wide range of disciplines into a single workplace. ""The physical spaces are really important,"" says Edward Lazowska, a computer scientist at the University of Washington. ""The idea was to accelerate discovery by building bridges between those who advance the methodology of data science -- researchers in mathematics, statistics and computer science -- and those who put it to work in the social, physical and life sciences.""

Not all PhD programmes prepare researchers for the real world of data science, so short-term training courses are becoming increasingly popular. Taylor got her foot in the door through a seven-week fellowship with Insight Data Science, an institution based in Palo Alto, California, that connects data scientists with US companies. Its fellows have gone on to careers at Amazon, Facebook, JP Morgan and both large and small technology companies.

Taylor says that the Insight fellowship was invaluable in teaching her the skills needed to land her current job. Among other proficiencies, that training taught her to think beyond data analysis to the practical applications of the finished product. ""The business-oriented thinking at Insight was very helpful,"" she says. She has observed that PhD-level scientists who land data-science jobs in industry tend to struggle with the transition unless they've already had first-hand industry experience. ""I had a very fast start with my company because of my ability to think about products,"" she says.

Data science has also arrived at hospitals and medical centres, giving many research scientists another outlet for their skills. As part of her neuroscience training at New York University and the nearby University of Rochester, Anasuya Das, also a former Insight fellow, had to learn the coding language C++ to build software to help individuals recovering from strokes to practise visual learning using their home computers. Das also took a couple of computational-neuroscience courses that helped to spark her interest in data science as a full-time career, which she now pursues at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

Das is working on a system to match patients with clinical trials. ""My days vary widely, and range from doing pure software engineering to meeting with physicians about the products we're building,"" she says.

Lazowska predicts that the rise of data science will eventually transform the 'publish or perish' system of science. In time, codes and data sets will -- as publications are currently -- become prerequisites for career advancement, he thinks. For now, he says, he and his colleagues are encouraging researchers to list data-science accomplishments on their CVs. They also recommend that promotion and tenure committees consider these feats as valid metrics.

Ram has loaded his CV with a wide range of data-science projects. He is currently working on a long-term effort to measure the impact of human activity on Tahiti's ecology. The questions have become more sophisticated since his Yellowstone days, but so have the tools. Instead of labouring for months over a data set, he can now get results in hours -- which is not to say that data science has become easy.

""A big challenge for a lot of folks is having the bandwidth to learn some of these new tools and how to correctly apply them,"" Ram says. ""As more time goes by, it will become more likely that almost every principal investigator will need someone on the team who has these special data skills."" The definition and expectations of data science may shift over time, but the field is here to stay."
185,185,"As the number of obese childeren in the U.S. increases, a new study finds guidelines aimed to prevent childhood obesity are not being followed, according to researchers from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.

The 5-2-1-0 guidelines recommend that kids eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, spend less that two hours in front of a screen (including TV, computers, video games and mobile devices), fit one hour of physical participation into their day and that they consume zero sugar-sweetened drinks. The guidelines, which have been promoted nationally, suggest that children trade soda, fruit juice and sports drinks with water or low-fat milk.

For the study, researchers observed children's diet and physical activity for 24 hours. Researchers looked into dietary intake, screen time, body mass index at child care and at home, and used accelerometers to measure physical activity.

Among 400 preschool children only one child followed the prevention guidelines over the the course of a single day at daycare and at home, researchers found. The study found one in four children had a body mass index that labeled them as overweight. Researchers found only 17 percent of children followed the five servings of fruit and vegetables rule.

""The recommendation that we believe is the hardest for families to attain, based on our study and other similar studies, is fruit and vegetable intake,"" lead author of the study, Dr. Amrik Singh Khalsa, told International Business Times. ""Several studies including evaluations of national datasets have showed that children and adults do not meet fruit and vegetable recommendations and it is due to diet quality.""

Meanwhile, half of the children failed to keep away from sugar-sweetened beverages. The study also found 81 percent of children had less than two hours of screen time, but less than one percent met the one-hour physical activity rule.

""While disregard of the guidelines does not necessarily equate to a child becoming obese, following the guidelines can lead to healthier lives,"" Khalsa pointed out. ""Because preschool-aged children who are obese have a four-fold odds of being overweight or obese as adults, it is important to establish healthy diet and lifestyle behaviors early in life.""

Khalsa said there are various reasons why the guidelines are not being followed. One of them is the increase in tech usage at a younger age.

""The overall increased use of technology, i.e. screen time, which leads to sedentary behaviors, which has become increasingly more common even at a young age,"" he said. ""This is coupled with the lack of adequate physical activity which further increases the risk of obesity.""

The ""higher availability for low-nutritious, processed foods, including junk food, fast food and sugary drinks is also to blame, and heavy marketing to promote them,"" also play a part in the lack of the guidelines' attainment, Khalsa said.

""These foods tend to be cheaper than fruits and vegetables,"" he added.

Childhood Obesity In The US

The number of U.S. children with obesity has more than tripled since the 1970s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this year. Approximately one in five minors ages 6-19 in the United States are currently obese.

Childhood obesity can lead to immediate and long-term impacts on physical, social, and emotional health, experts say. Kids with obesity are at higher risk for having diseases and chronic health issues, like asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, and risk factors for heart disease. Children that are overweight can also lead to an adulthood with obesity, which is linked to serious conditions and diseases, like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and several types of cancer.

"" [...] Obesity in childhood significantly increases the risk of obesity as an adult and is harder and more expensive to treat obesity than prevent it,"" said Khalsa.

Childhood obesity can also take an emotional toll on minors, as obese children tend to be bullied and teased more than those with normal weight. They are also more likely to suffer from social isolation, depression, and lower self-esteem, experts say.

The recent study, published online in the journal Preventive Medicine Reports, is believed to be the first to look into the attainment of the guidelines among preschool children who attend full-time child cares. The findings are part of the Preschool Eating and Activity Study (PEAS), the first study that analyzes preschool influences on kids' physical activity over a single day and over multiple weather scenarios."
186,186,"A WEST Cork woman's support for a campaign for a 'ginger' emoji to represent redheads on mobile phones looks set to get the green light.

While redheads were disappointed that there was no Redhead Convention in Crosshaven this summer, they do now have something to smile about. It appears that Convention organiser Joleen Cronin's backing for a bid to have ginger emojis on phones and computers will finally bear fruit next year.

It was announced recently that the 'Irish' emoji has been included in a list by Unicode - the official company who make the emojis - which means it could be in place by 2018.

Crosshaven publican Joleen, who runs Cronin's Bar in the village, and is one of the organisers of the Redhead Convention, said this is great news for redheads everywhere.

'I'm delighted with this announcement and it's finally great to be on equal platform as everyone else,' Joleen told The Southern Star.

'The call to include a ginger emoji really gathered momentum over the past two years and petitions were started up around the world to include ginger in their emojis.'

Despite the cancellation of this year's Redhead Convention, which celebrated all things ginger, Joleen said some people still came to the seaside town for what was a low-key reunion for regular festival-goers.

One former ginger, Fergal Barr from Derry, even took to walking to Crosshaven to raise money for the Irish Cancer Society, a charity that the Redhead Convention has been supporting since it started in 2010.

'Fergal has been coming to Crosshaven for the Redhead Convention for several years and he finally got it together to do the walk this summer, even though no festival was taking place and it was a great achievement,' said Joleen.

Accompanying him on the 'Redhead 300' trek from Derry to Crosshaven were Galway cancer survivor Shirley McEntee and Aine Curran, who all donned red wigs and completed the walk in 14 days, raising over €4,000 for the Irish Cancer Society. They landed in Crosshaven last Friday and were warmly welcomed by Joleen and the people of the town.

Joleen also pointed out that the Redhead Portrait Exhibition by photographer Jorg Koster, which was staged successfully in both Cork and Dublin airports last year, is now on permanent display at Cork Airport.

'It got a great reaction last year, so it's great news to see it get a home in Cork Airport for a few years,' added Joleen."

What if you could skip tedious airport security lines, while a special device able to sniff out explosives works silently in the background?

This is only one of the possible uses of what Agabi says is the world's first neurotechnology device developed by his Silicon Valley-based start-up Koniku and unveiled at the TEDGlobal conference in Tanzania on August 27.

While those in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are working furiously to create machines that can mimic the brain, or -- like tech entrepreneur Elon Musk -- implant computers in our brains, Agabi has found a way to merge lab-grown neurons with electronic circuitry.

As many grapple with the finite processing power of silicon, the 38-year-old said he had looked to the brain which is ""the most powerful processor the universe has ever seen.""

To simulate the power of just 204 brain neurons would require a supercomputer, he said.

""Instead of copying a neuron, why not just take the biological cell itself and use it as it is? That thought is radical. The consequence of this is mind-boggling,"" he said.

So he and a team of geneticists, physicists, bio-engineers, molecular biologists and others set about doing just that, focusing on the problems that were particularly hard for silicon devices to solve.

This includes detecting volatile chemicals and explosives or even illnesses such as cancer.

'A World First'

Agabi said the Koniku Kore device is ""a world first"" and able to do just that, essentially through breathing in and smelling the air.

He said ""major brands"", including those in the travel industry, had signed up and the start-up's current revenues of $8 million were expected to leap to $30 million by 2018.

One of the main challenges was finding a way to keep the neurons alive, a secret Agabi did not wish to expand on, saying only they could be kept alive for two years in a lab environment and two months in the device.

As AI improves in leaps and bounds, scientists are trying to make and succeeding in making machines more like our brains, able to learn and understand their surroundings: a prospect that is terrifying for many.

Musk, who has repeatedly warned about the perils of AI making humans obsolete, is working on a new project to implant ""neural lace"" brain-interface technology to prevent humans becoming like a ""house cat"" to potential machine masters.

However, Agabi, who grew up in Lagos where he helped his mother sell food on the streets, believes the future of AI lies in making machines more alive.

He believes his company could build a cognitive humanoid system based on synthetic living neurons in the next five to seven years.

""It's not science fiction,"" he said.

""We want to build a brain of biological neurons -- an autonomous system that has intelligence. We do not want to build a human brain.""

Agabi did a bachelors degree in theoretical physics in Lagos before taking an interest in neuroscience and bio-engineering for his PhD in London.

African innovation at TED

He spoke at the opening session of the four-day TEDGlobal conference, putting African ideas, innovation and creativity in the spotlight with a variety of speakers who each get an 18-minute window to get across their message of choice.

TED -- originally known as Technology, Entertainment and Design -- has built a global following for its online videos of inspiring talks devoted to ""ideas worth spreading.""

The annual international version is taking place in Africa for the first time in a decade with a new crop of ""TED Fellows"" from the continent to take to the stage.

""This gathering couldn't come a moment too soon,"" said TEDGlobal co-curator Emeka Okafor.

""Africa has experienced spectacular economic, demographic and creative growth, but both opportunity and danger are rising at an exponential rate. Our conference will gather the idea catalysts, problem-solvers and change-makers already hard at work here charting Africa's own path to modernity.""

188,188,"'Nothing in the laws of physics that says we can't build machines much smarter than us'

Should we be worried about the dangerous potential of artificial intelligence?

Sort of, says Max Tegmark, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Tegmark is a co-founder of the Future of Life Institute, a Boston-based research organization that studies global catastrophic risk, with an especial focus on AI. He's also the author of Life 3.0, which is out today. Life 3.0 outlines the current state of AI safety research and the questions we'll need to answer as a society if we want the technology to be used for good.

Tegmark doesn't believe that doomsaying Terminator scenarios are inevitable, but he doesn't think that we're doing enough thinking about artificial intelligence either. And he's not the only one who's concerned. Stephen Hawking has been urging researchers to pay more attention to AI safety for years now. Microsoft partnered with Elon Musk to create OpenAI, an organization dedicated to the same issue. Musk, who also donated $10 million to FLI in 2015, also recommended Life 3.0 on Twitter.

The Verge chatted with Tegmark about his book, what we should be doing, and why he thinks the discussion around AI is the most important one of our time. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

What does the title of the book refer to? What is ""Life 3.0"" and what were Life 1.0 and 2.0?

Well, I think of life broadly as any process that can retain its complexity and reproduce. Life 1.0 would be like bacteria. Bacteria are small atoms put together in the form of simple algorithms that control what they do. For instance, whenever the bacteria notices there is a higher sugar concentration in front than in back of it, it comes forward, but if it notices that there's less sugar in front of it, then it turns around. But bacteria can never truly learn anything in its lifetime. The only way that bacteria can gradually get better software, or learn, is through evolution over many generations.

We humans are what I call ""life 2.0."" We still have our hardware, or bodies, largely designed by evolution, but we can learn. We have enormous power to upload new ""software"" into our minds. For example, if you decide you want to become a lawyer, you can go to law school, and law school involves uploading new algorithms into your brain so that now suddenly you can have the expertise of the lawyer. It's this ability to design our own software rather than having to wait for evolution to give it to us that enable us to dominate this planet and create modern civilization and culture. The cultural revolution comes precisely from the fact that we can copy ideas and knowledge from other people in our lifetime.

Life 3.0 is life that fully breaks free of its evolutionary shackles and is able to design not only its software, but its hardware. Put another way, if we create AI which is at least as smart as us, then it can not only design its own software to make itself learn new things, but there's always an attempt to swap up upgraded memory to remember a million times more stuff, or get more computing power. In contrast, humans can put in artificial pacemakers or artificial knees, but we can't change anything truly dramatic. You can never make yourself a hundred times taller or a thousand times faster at thinking. Our intelligence is made of squishy biological neurons and is fundamentally limited by how much brain mass fits through our mom's birth canal, but artificial intelligence isn't.

Some people are still skeptical that superintelligence will happen at all, but you seem to believe strongly that it will, and it's just a matter of time. You're a physicist, what's your take from that perspective?

I think most people think of intelligence as something mysterious and limited to biological organisms. But from my perspective as a physicist, intelligence is just simply information processing performed by elementary particles moving around according to the laws of physics. Nothing in the laws of physics that says we can't build machines much smarter than us, or that intelligence needs to be built from organic matter. I don't think there's any secret sauce that absolutely requires carbon atoms or blood.

I had a lot of fun in the book thinking about what are the ultimate limits of the laws of physics on how smart you can be. The short answer is that it's sky-high, millions and millions and millions of times above where we are now. We ain't seen nothing yet. There's a huge potential for our universe to wake up much more, which I think is an inspiring thought, coming from a cosmology background.

I know that FLI does work with issues like nuclear disarmament, but it made spreading the word about AI safety its first major goal. Similarly, you believe that the conversation around AI safety is ""the most important conversation."" Why? Why is it more important than, say, climate change?

We've done a lot for nuclear war and risk reduction, but the question of a good future with AI is absolutely more important than all of these other things. Take climate change: Yes, it might create huge problems for us in 50 years or 100 years, but many leading AI researchers think that superhuman intelligence will arrive before then, in a matter of decades.

That's obviously a way bigger deal than climate change. First of all, if that happens, it would utterly transform life as we know it. Either it helps you flourish like never before or becomes the worst thing that ever happened to us. And second, if it goes well, we could use it to solve climate change and all our other problems. If you care about poverty, social justice, climate change, disease -- all of these problems stump us because we're not smart enough to figure out how to solve them, but if we can amplify our own intelligence with machine intelligence, far beyond ours, we have an incredible potential to do better.

So, it's something which is different from all the other things on your list in that there's not just possible downsides, but huge possible upsides in that it can help solve all the other problems. Cancer, for example, or disease more generally -- cancer can be cured, it's just that we humans haven't been smart enough to figure out how to deal with it in all cases. We're limited by our own intelligence and all the research we do.

There's a fairly wide spectrum of attitudes on this topic, from the skeptics to the utopians. Where do you put yourself?

I'm optimistic that it's possible to create superhuman intelligence, and I'm also optimistic in that we can create a great future with AI. But I'm cautious in the sense that I don't think it's guaranteed. There are crucial questions we have to answer first for things to go well, and they might take 30 years to answer. We should get cracking on them now, not the night before some dudes decide to switch on their superintelligence.

What questions? You said you're not interested in what you call ""near-term"" questions, like how automation is going to affect jobs.

There's so much talk all the time now about job automation, people tend to forget that it's important to also look at what comes next. I'm talking about questions like, how do we transform today's easily hackable computers into robust AI systems? How can you make AI systems understand our goals as they get ever-smarter?

When your computer crashes, it's annoying, you lost an hour of work, but it wouldn't be as funny if that computer were controlling the airplane you were flying in or the nuclear arsenal of the Untied States.

What goals should AI have? Should it be the goals of some American computer programmers, or the goals of ISIS or of people in the Middle Ages? What kind of society can we create? Look how much polarization is there in the US right now.

If we don't know what we want, we're less likely to get it, you can't leave this conversation just to tech geeks like myself, either, because the question of what sort of society we create is going to affect everybody.

A lot of the initiatives you discuss are big-picture -- like how laws need to be updated to keep up with AI. But what about the average person? What are we supposed to do?

Talking is a great start. The fact that none of the two presidential candidates in our last election talked about AI at all, even though I think it's the most important issue facing us, is a reflection of the fact that people aren't talking about it and therefore don't care about it when they vote.

When will you consider yourself ""successful"" in making sure we've had this conversation?

Look at it this way: we have billions and billions of dollars now invested in making AI more powerful and almost nothing in AI safety research. No governments of the world have said that AI safety research should be an integral part of their computer science funding, and it's like, why would you fund building nuclear reactors without funding nuclear reactor safety? Now we're funding AI research with no budget in sight for AI safety. I'm certainly not going to say that we have enough conversation about this until this, at least, changes. Every AI researcher I know thinks it would be a good idea to have more funding for this. So I'd say, we're successful when things like this are going a little bit in the right direction."
189,189,"It could potentially replace current airport security systems

A prototype computer has been revealed at the TEDGlobal conference in Tanzania that fuses live neurons from mice stem cells into a silicon chip. The system could be used to find bombs through their smell, potentially replacing security systems currently found in airports, and may even be able to detect illnesses such as cancer.

Nigerian neuroscientist Oshiorenoya Agabi is the founder of Silicon Valley-based start-up Koniku, which is building the modem-sized Koniku Kore (pictures of the device can't yet be publicly revealed). The 10-person company started in 2015 and has already raised $1 million in funding and $10 million in revenue.

""We merged synthetic neurobiology with traditional silicon technology with the goal of fixing urgent real-world problems,"" said Agabi.

While computers can perform tasks humans struggle with, such as complex maths problems, there are many cognitive functions, including recognizing smells, where the brain performs much better and without requiring the massive amount of power a silicon-based processor would need.

""Biology is technology. Bio is tech,"" Agabi told those at the conference. ""Our deep learning networks are all copying the brain [....] You can give the neurons instructions about what to do - in our case, we tell it to provide a receptor that can detect explosives.""

The Koniku Kore could also be used to detect illnesses in the same way a dog can smell cancerous cells. It may be able to sense markers of a disease in the air molecules that a patient gives off, according to the BBC.

Keeping the neurons alive outside of lab conditions has proved challenging, but Agabi says they can survive for months and believes that similar future technologies will last much longer. ""We think that the processing power that is going to run the robots of the future will be synthetic biology-based and we are laying the foundations for that today,"" he said."

The feat may have found a way to solve one of life's puzzling dilemmas by making air travel more pleasant.

Expected to help skip tedious airport security lines, the special device known as Koniku Kore, is able to sniff out explosives works silently in the background.

The chip is the world's first neurotechnology device developed by Agabi's Silicon Valley-based start-up Koniku and unveiled at the TEDGlobal conference in Tanzania at the weekend.

The device has been trained to recognise the smell of explosives and could change the way airport security checks are traditionally done.

The inventor is betting on the modem-sized device to provide the brain for future robots.

All of the big tech firms, from Google to Microsoft, are rushing to create artificial intelligence modelled on the human brain.

Mr Agabi is attempting to reverse-engineer biology, which already accomplishes this function with a fraction of the power it would take a silicon-based processor.

""Biology is technology. Bio is tech,"" he says. ""Our deep learning networks are all copying the brain.""

Agabi launched his start-up Koniku over a year ago, and has raised $1m (£800,000) in funding and claims it is already making profits of $10m in deals with the security industry.

Koniku Kore is a combination of living neurons and silicon, with olfactory capabilities -- basically sensors that can detect and recognise smells.

""You can give the neurons instructions about what to do - in our case we tell it to provide a receptor that can detect explosives."" Agabi said.

The Nigerian foresees a future where such devices can be discreetly used at various points in airports, eliminating the need for queues to get through airport security.

As well as being used for bomb detection, the device can also be used to detect illness by sensing markers of a disease in the air molecules that a patient gives off.

Like certain dogs can sniff out illnesses, Agabi explains that 'Koniku' a Yoruba word for 'Immortal' can recreate similar feat.

""In the same way that a dog is able to detect if someone has prostate cancer, the real question we ask is 'how does a dog do it?' We can clone that process on our chip, so yes in the same way that a dog can detect diseases or explosives at an airport, it's a sensory system, that is essentially what we recreate in our chip,"" Agabi says.

Advances in neuroscience, bioengineering and computer science means that much more is known about how the human brain works than ever before.

This is fuelling the development of neuro-technology - devices that aim to mould the brain into computers.

Much of the current work is aimed at improving brain function, particularly for those with brain-related injuries or diseases.

Speaking on using it as a means to fight terrorism, Agabi sees no reason why he can't use the resources in hand to combat terror while going about it ethically."
192,192,"Let's call her Jane. She's 32 and a junior vice president at a big investment bank. The firm's attempt at more manageable hours has made it possible for her to reshuffle her work and stay on after having a baby. But growing responsibilities to clients pull her away from her new role. She totes little Jack to the office on Saturdays and balances her travel schedule so that either she or her husband can be home each evening. When Jack is 2 going on 3, he diverts this promising high-powered career with a single game of ""pretend."" As she remembers it, he said, "" 'Pretend you're a kid, and I'm your mommy.' I agreed, and so he said, 'I'm the mommy, I'm going to work. You're the kid, you cry.' "" Needless to say, Jane did.

Now consider Luis, 39, a single dad with a full-time job as a line cook at a restaurant on Capitol Hill. The age gap between young parents and the unencumbered at this workplace is about the same as among the bankers. Almost all the employees in their 30s are kitchen staff with kids at home, while the wait staff is made up of 20-somethings still living with roommates. When a sick babysitter means missing a shift, Luis has to negotiate a last-minute cover with the rest of the staff. ""If it happens too often, we'd have to find a full-time replacement for the good of the restaurant,"" the assistant manager tells me. ""Fortunately, we're like a family,"" and someone's almost always ready to step up. But the assistant manager is still young, in her mid-20s, and if she were pregnant there would be no possibility of paid maternity leave. In this sort of business, if you don't work, you don't get paid.

President Donald Trump's 2018 budget proposal earmarked $19 billion over the next 10 years for paid leave for new parents whose employers provide none: six weeks covered by an unspecified reform of state-level unemployment benefits and increased payroll taxes.

The introduction of a new unfunded federal mandate raises many questions, most with no ready answer. But two things are clear. One, a healthy balance between family and professional duties eludes workers at all strata of American life. It's a universal, though variously manifested, challenge most large companies, six states, dozens of cities, and every other developed nation have taken on. Second, the very presence of paid leave in the president's ""America First"" budget constituted a win for Ivanka Trump, who was the driving force behind her father's campaign promise of paid leave for new mothers.

When Ivanka Trump introduced the next president of the United States at the Republican National Convention last July, she conjured a portrait of him -- my father the feminist -- foreign even to his most loyal supporters. And she stumped on atypical topics for the biggest gathering of Republicans: the wage gap and paid family leave. ""Women represent 46 percent of the total U.S. labor force,"" she barnstormed with perfect poise. ""And 40 percent of American households have female primary breadwinners.""

Trump's campaign promise was actually less progressive than what his budget proposed in May. The new plan would extend to fathers, like Luis, and adoptive parents -- though the particulars of the coverage would be left up to each state's discretion.

Getting a price tag in the proposed budget doesn't mean a policy will count among congressional priorities. But putting paid family leave into wider consideration counts for something in Washington, and the paid-leave initiative got a standing ovation during the president's joint address to Congress in February. The first daughter has pushed a debate long-running among the city-dwelling center-left power elite onto Capitol Hill. It concerns the still-fractious concept of the ""motherhood gap,"" at the edge of which women like Jane too often exit the fast track of the white-collar world.

THE MOTHERHOOD GAP

Ivanka Trump's counterpart at the Democratic convention was Kirsten Gillibrand. ""Families today look almost nothing like they did a generation ago,"" the junior senator from New York announced. ""Eight in 10 moms work outside the home; 4 in 10 moms are the primary or sole breadwinners, and many are single. .  .  . Yet today our policies are still stuck in the Mad Men era."" The Senate's premier working mom, she noted that ""child care can cost as much as college tuition"" and that Washington is far behind the new reality in America.

The data don't lie. Both husband and wife work in 61 percent of families in which the parents are married, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Labor. Seventy percent of mothers with children under 18 were working or looking for work in 2016. Mothers' workforce participation shrinks the younger their children are: About 65 percent of mothers with children under 6 worked in 2016, but only 59 percent of mothers of infants. Tellingly, married mothers with small babies are far less likely to be looking for work than those single or divorced -- 3 percent versus 12.

Stories like Jane's help explain the gender disparity in the middle and upper rungs of top financial firms and the quickening flurry of attention every time a new study quantifies the underrepresentation of women in American corporations' C-suites -- one expression of the motherhood gap, a more accurate name for that symptom of systemic sexism often called the ""wage gap."" Economists Marianne Bertrand, Claudia Goldin, and Lawrence Katz concluded, after tracking close to 3,000 University of Chicago M.B.A.'s who graduated between 1990 and 2006, that women's earnings fall behind men's because of motherhood and the choices it foists on working moms: ""[T]he observed patterns of decreased labor supply and earnings substantially reflect women's choices given family constraints and the inflexibility of work schedules in many corporate and finance sector jobs,"" they wrote. A Harvard Business Review survey, which Sheryl Sandberg cited in her bestselling book Lean In, found that 43 percent of ""highly qualified women"" with children cease working at some point. (One can wonder if Facebook COO Sandberg, who earned her business degree at Harvard in the mid-1990s, was one of the women they surveyed.) The same survey found that just 24 percent of men similarly ""off-ramp"" from their careers -- and most of these not because of the burdens of children.

The United States stands alone among 41 economically comparable democratic nations in not mandating paid leave for new parents, according to data presented last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The U.N. reported in 2014 that only Suriname, Oman, Papua New Guinea, and a smattering of South Pacific islands joined the United States in offering new mothers no form of paid leave. (Oman has since established a 50-day paid maternity leave.) Half a dozen predominantly liberal states -- California first among them but also New Jersey, New York, Washington, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia -- and more than 30 cities (San Francisco's fully paid leave policy, for instance, surpasses the state-level offerings) have enacted paid-leave mandates, but different ones, which multistate companies struggle to meet.

Under the conveniently vague catch-all of ""pro-family policy"" are a wide variety of proposals fighting for attention on Capitol Hill. There's a confusion of goals and ideal beneficiaries that seem at cross-purposes in bills that claim a common cause -- improving the work-life balance for American families. Any autopsy of paid-leave promises would diagnose a terminal diversity of definitions, whether it's partly or fully paid, federally mandated or entirely optional but tax-incentivized and tiered. The leading Democratic proposal sets leave at 12 weeks, while IvankaCare asks only for 6. But even to consider these, in the interest of that elusive compromise, requires a common understanding of what ""paid family leave"" means -- what should it accomplish and who is it for? The answers, of course, depend on whom you ask.

FIRST DAUGHTER, WORKING MOTHER

""Politicians talk about wage equality, but my father has made it a practice at his company throughout his entire career,"" Ivanka Trump told the tens of millions watching the Republican convention. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, companies with 50 or more employees -- like the Trump Organization -- must offer 12 weeks of unpaid leave to workers with a new baby at home. But small businesses are exempt from the rule, and losing 12 weeks' wages would be an unbridgeable hardship for most new parents working for an hourly wage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just 7 percent of private-sector workers in service fields had access to paid family leave last March. Overall, 13 percent of private-sector workers had access to some form of paid leave, while 28 percent of those working in management, business, or finance had such a benefit.

Ivanka, who became an executive vice president at the Trump Organization at age 24, wants to be seen as a working mother first. She illuminated the Trump campaign's pro-family platform in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last September, calling for six weeks' of paid maternity leave. ""The current federal policies created to benefit families were written more than 65 years ago when dual-income families were not the norm,"" she wrote. ""Today, however, in about two-thirds of married couples, both spouses work,"" she added. ""Gender is no longer the factor creating the greatest wage discrepancy in this country, motherhood is.""

The transferability of a billionaire's daughter's situation is a difficult premise for any political argument. Ivanka knows she's not the natural target for paid-leave proposals, says Angela Rachidi, who studies poverty at the American Enterprise Institute: ""The people who are the ones being forced to go back to work when their babies are a week old, it's not Ivanka Trump's friends, and it wasn't me and people like me. We figured out a way to make it work. It's really the low-wage, low-skilled workers who don't have a lot of options."" Rachidi was a member of a joint AEI-Brookings Institution working group that in June produced a plan calling for eight weeks of job-protected leave for all new parents -- mothers, fathers, adoptive, biological. They would receive 70 percent of their pay, up to $600 per week, in a revenue-neutral proposal covered by an increased payroll tax on employees and equal cuts in federal spending. Ivanka previewed the plan before its publication and reportedly ""loved it.""

Abby McCloskey was another member of the working group. An economist, political consultant, and leading conservative advocate for paid family leave, she was pregnant during the 2016 presidential primaries while working as a policy adviser for Texas's Rick Perry -- who dropped out of the race just at the tail end of her two-month paid maternity leave from the campaign. Republicans, she says, are ""pro-life, pro-family, pro-opportunity,"" and they face a values test with the issue of paid leave. ""If they don't move on this, I think it will be an obvious sign, and it's not just that they didn't like the Democrats' proposal or it was impossible to come to a compromise,"" says McCloskey, an expectant mother once again. ""This is an issue that is central to what the party says it values."" Republicans, she adds, will have ""no one else to blame if this doesn't pass, so that's a really heavy burden and a crucial test.""

As younger lawmakers inherit the GOP, the Eisenhower-era ideal of household roles fades further from memory and new types of pro-family policy are gaining ground. McCloskey perceives ""more appetite for this policy among younger politicians, and certainly among women politicians who have experienced firsthand having a child and breastfeeding."" Marco Rubio, she notes, is a 46-year-old father of four. ""I think the reason why he would propose a plan, and why Ivanka Trump in her mid-30s would make it her focus, is that people who have first-hand experience [of the modern family] are going to be the biggest advocates.""

""While the public policy process is messy and slow,"" says McCloskey* a professor of social work at Columbia, ""the ground is softening on paid leave."" In a poll by the National Partnership for Women and Families around the time of the election, 82 percent of voters agreed that Congress and the new president should explore paid family leave and 78 percent that they would like a ""national paid family and medical leave fund"" to foot the bill for 12 weeks off when life overtakes work. What exactly that legislative exploration would look like -- and how it would be funded -- will be for Congress to decide.

THE TAX CREDIT TWO-STEP

Early in her father's presidency, Ivanka Trump summoned the Republican women of Congress to the White House to talk about paths ahead for child-care and paid-leave policies. But the likelier a proposal is to succeed on the Hill, the less it looks like Ivanka's ideal of paid parental leave. In the weeks after her plan got that federal price tag -- $19 billion over 10 years, from state-level reallocations -- the Trump administration (in which Ivanka is a senior adviser to the president) considered a conservative alternative. On June 20, the first daughter and nine Republican congressmen sat around a table at the invitation of Marco Rubio and talked ""pro-family tax policy."" The Florida senator had approvingly retweeted Ivanka's praise of the AEI-Brookings report. ""In America, no family should be forced to put off having children due to economic insecurity,"" Rubio wrote on June 6. ""@‌IvankaTrump is doing important work.""

Yet his fellow Republicans aren't buying. Arizona senator Jeff Flake, a Trump critic, said that no proposal that levied a new payroll tax would be ""seriously considered"" by their conference. Roy Blunt of Missouri, who chairs the Senate subcommittee in charge of budgeting the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, tells me that paid leave, while ""a good idea"" in theory, isn't in Republicans' plans. Programs to fund research into mental health and opioid abuse treatment ""will continue to be priorities that will likely take precedence over a new unfunded issue like paid family leave,"" he says. And the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin Hatch of Utah -- who told reporters shortly after the budget's release that he supports paid leave -- equivocated in a prepared statement: ""While this is a worthy goal, there are a variety of ways it can be achieved.""

The following week, Senate conservatives had a plan to push the White House their way -- toward a preexisting tax credit proposal that targets families with children under 5 and does not require parents to prove they are employed. The subject line of a June 13 email from Rubio to Republican lawmakers invited them to a ""Meeting with Ivanka Trump on Child Tax Credit,"" signaling his and Utah senator Mike Lee's intention to sell the first daughter on their modest substitute, one they'd included two years prior in a joint tax proposal that failed. The Lee-Rubio plan expands the existing child tax credit to give parents with children not yet in school $2,500 per child, per year -- a $1,500 increase on the $1,000 credit already enshrined in the tax code.

In the June 20 meeting, Ivanka heard multiple policy proposals. ""She was an active listener,"" says Nebraska senator Deb Fischer, whose Strong Families Act -- a tax credit to reward employers for offering up to 12 weeks of paid family leave -- remains the only recent bill of its kind to be introduced by a Republican. Fischer's mind is on working-class Americans, those without a safety net to fall back on. ""I think we do have a consensus, Ivanka and I, that this is the group we need to target."" She has high hopes for the presidential embrace of paid leave, because as she says of her own legislation, ""It's been kind of tough to get it moved.""

Republicans have a long record of substituting tax credits for paternalistic social policies. In 1971, Richard Nixon vetoed a bipartisan child-care subsidy at adviser Patrick Buchanan's urging. But five years later, Gerald Ford enacted an alternative that was less challenging to traditional mores: a dependent and child-care tax credit, which George H. W. Bush later expanded into a direct subsidy to help parents make ends meet.

""I think it's great!"" says Abby McCloskey, when I ask her about the Rubio-Lee tax credit seeming like a surer thing than paid leave as proposed. ""It's less targeted,"" she adds, pointing out that while it lacks the economic benefits of paid leave, it gives parents flexibility. The child tax credit expansion is expected to lead a ""pro-family"" package in Republicans' tax reform plan this fall. And even if tax reform falls through, we may well see a standalone child tax credit bill.

Angela Rachidi is more critical than McCloskey of conservative senators' desire to substitute tax credits for paid leave. ""There are reasons to expand the CTC,"" she concedes, ""but there are really no good arguments to make it a substitute for these other policies that are needed. It's a mistake."" In her view, Rubio and Lee's proposed raising of the credit to $2,500 per year means little to the low-wage worker who takes six weeks of leave at a loss of $2,100. ""It runs a risk of being a new federal expenditure that's not going to have very meaningful results,"" she tells me.

WOMEN WHO WORK -- ON CAPITOL HILL

Both Deb Fischer and Kirsten Gillibrand are pushing bills in the Senate that would give workers 12 weeks of paid leave. But there's a deep difference, one that reflects their disparate backgrounds and ideas of America.

Fischer is a moderate Republican from a western state. She raised a family first, then pursued a public career -- a degree at her state university followed by successful campaigns for local, state, and national offices. She and her husband are ranchers. The Fischer family followed a premodern model of home economics, and for as long as her three sons worked alongside their father, investment in their upbringing showed returns in their labor. Most people don't do it that way anymore. So when Fischer sells her paid-leave bill -- a 25 percent tax credit for employers who offer 12 weeks of paid leave to their workers -- to colleagues and to the press, she doesn't talk about herself. She talks about single parents waiting tables and adult children caring for infirm parents while working retail for an hourly wage to make ends meet.

Gillibrand is the junior senator from one of the most populous and powerful northeastern states. She has a banker husband, a moderately preppy pedigree -- she's a graduate of Emma Willard and Dartmouth -- and a Democratic activist grandmother whose legacy propelled her toward political office after a high-powered law career. She was in her second term in the House of Representatives in 2009 when she was picked to replace Hillary Clinton, who'd become Barack Obama's secretary of state. Gillibrand had only recently given birth to her second son. The spotlight and the timing of her pregnancy turned the first-ever breastfeeding senator from a conservative ""blue dog"" Democrat to a women's rights activist.

Both of these lady lawmakers' ideas for paid family leave cite flaws in the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) as their legislative inspiration -- unpaid leave won't help low-wage workers. Passed two weeks into Bill Clinton's presidency, the FMLA built on job-protected leave policies that had already been enacted in 34 states. It foreshadowed Clinton's ""Middle Class Bill of Rights,"" which introduced a new child tax credit four years later. Unlike President Ford's child tax credit, which can cover as much as 35 percent of care costs, the Clinton tax credit offered parents a set sum per child. In his first term, George W. Bush doubled the credit-per-child, from $500 to $1000. It is this credit that Rubio and Lee now seek to expand to $2,500. Fischer and Gillibrand welcome such an expansion, but only in addition to and not instead of passing a paid-leave bill.

Gillibrand's Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act (known as the FAMILY Act) offers a uniform 12 weeks paid leave for illness (family or personal) or the birth or adoption of a child. It would be administered through Social Security and funded by tax hikes on both employers and employees. Only about 59 percent of working women are actually eligible for unpaid leave, and the eligibility is much lower for low-income women: Department of Labor surveys have found that unpaid-leave takers' most common worry is financial loss. A mere 6 percent of employers required to provide leave under the existing law gave their workers fully paid leave as of 2016.

Gillibrand enthusiastically welcomed Ivanka Trump's advocacy of paid leave and hoped for wider Republican support. Her bill's great stumbling block since its introduction in 2013 has been its failure to catch a single conservative cosponsor. Although it boasts a lengthy roster of progressive supporters -- from Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein -- the bill has never won the approval of centrist senators like Tim Kaine, Mark Warner, or Joe Manchin. All three put their names on Deb Fischer's employer incentive plan.

When I ask Gillibrand whether she would consider a compromise on paid family leave with the White House's blessing -- and named the AEI-Brookings' eight weeks for new parents as an example -- she indulges the hypothetical only to swat it away. ""It's not what I support. It's limited and not paid for."" A staffer chimes in, ""It leaves out 75 percent of the people that our bill would cover.""

NEW PARENTS VERSUS OLD PARENTS

This figure reflects one of the complexities of paid-family leave discussions: People are often talking about apples and oranges. Would-be paid medical leave takers outnumber new parents threefold. The former group are the focus of a companion bill to Gillibrand's FAMILY Act, which has three times been introduced in the House of Representatives by Connecticut's Rosa DeLauro. Where Gillibrand reps the maternal minority, the 14-term DeLauro speaks for the growing cohort of ailing seniors in our aging nation and their grown children who need time off from work to care for them. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer while serving as chief of staff for former Connecticut senator Chris Dodd, and he provided her paid leave.

DeLauro applauds Republicans for coming around. ""It used to be just the Democrats looking at these issues,"" she tells me. ""While I believe Donald Trump's parental leave plan doesn't go far enough, I welcome him to the conversation."" ""Half measures"" -- an employer tax credit, a program for parental but not medical leave, or a refundable child-tax-credit expansion -- aren't worth the trouble, DeLauro warns, because they'll let lukewarm advocates ""check that box, and move on to the next thing.""

Deb Fischer scoffs at such reflexive opposition to a moderate answer to the universal mandates her Democratic colleagues seek to impose. She knows her bill covers nowhere near so many parents as Gillibrand's federal mandate built atop Social Security, but for her a bill inoffensive enough to pass is a win. Considering what's at stake, ""I would find it very difficult to look a single mother in the eye and say, 'Well, I didn't vote for Senator Fischer's bill so you could take a couple hours off to take your child to the doctor because it didn't go far enough.' To me that is a pretty weak excuse.""

The splash made by the Rubio-Lee plan didn't escape paid family leave's Senate Republican champion either. ""Ivanka has focused a lot on the child tax credit, as have Senator Rubio and Senator Lee,"" Fischer tells me, after running down a list of other proposals discussed at Rubio's meeting -- tax credits for home caregivers and for adoptive parents among them. To the extent that a tax credit substitution nods to stay-at-home moms, it's worth remembering that they are more common in Lee's Utah than any other state.

There's certainly a give-me-liberty tinge to Senate Republicans' nudging Ivanka to the right on the one fixed point in her legislative agenda. But conservative arguments for a comprehensive paid-leave program -- one that would increase payroll taxes and wouldn't even spare small businesses -- are rising to the fore. A set number of even partially paid weeks of leave, studies show, make new mothers far more likely to keep up regular employment. Advocates like Abby McCloskey want to make lifting these women and their children from a lifetime of welfare dependence a rallying cry for fiscal conservatives.

And the burden on small business shouldn't stand in the way of a federal mandate, former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin said during a panel discussion that marked the AEI-Brookings proposal's unveiling: ""Exempting small businesses says to me, 'Let's have a tax on growth,' "" he said -- a disincentive for employers ever to grow beyond being a small shop. And, he added, ""This isn't about the employer. It's about the kid. They are born to workers in small and large firms and we should care about them equally.""

SILICON VALLEY'S TRICKLE-DOWN EFFECT

In many ways, the market has already spoken. Silicon Valley has been host to a paid-leave arms race for years that, with flex schedules and work from home arrangements, set a social revolution in motion. In 2012, Google increased its paid leave for mothers from three to five months in response to internal findings that they'd failed to hang on to their female employees. The post-partum attrition rate halved as a result. In 2015, Netflix launched a thousand think pieces with a new policy offering paid maternity and paternity leave in the first year of a child's life, even for hourly workers. The unlimited approach allows parents to work continuously in small batches during extended time off.

""The hardest part in a woman's career is coming back after having a baby,"" says Janet Van Huysse, a longtime Silicon Valley human resources manager who built Twitter's benefits package for parents from the ground up. Her first child had just turned 1 when Van Huysse made her return to the workforce in 2009. Nascent 100-employee, zero-revenue Twitter was offering new mothers 12 weeks' leave and fathers 6 weeks -- now, it's 20 weeks for all parents. When her second child arrived on the scene, five weeks early, Van Huysse worked right through her leave -- a choice she advises against. ""I use that as a cautionary tale for parents,"" who, she tells me, haven't figured out yet how much more their children need them than their company does. ""You think that you're so important, but you're not going to be doing your best work. Plus, you're never going to get this time back. Your baby's never going to be a week old again, a month old again.""

The burden of putting a leave-length value on employees with families has fallen to young and highly competitive companies like Twitter. ""It's a reflection of your talent pool,"" Van Huysse says, and it's an investment in retention. ""A 20-week absence is not a big deal when you're looking at someone who you want to be a part of your company.""

Tech companies, competing to retain female employees and recruit the variously gendered, know that millennials are more than twice as likely as their elders to switch jobs in search of paid leave -- as reported in Gallup's 2017 State of the American Workplace. Savvy CEOs tout their escalating generosity in a game of corporate one-upsmanship.

In early 2017, Sheryl Sandberg, who'd earlier urged women to ""lean in,"" added 20 days of bereavement leave for any Facebook employee mourning a family member and longer for caring for a sick relative. She made the announcement in a moving public letter that invoked her husband's sudden death and its toll on her young family. Facebook also offers fertility benefits -- company money to fund in vitro fertilization and egg-freezing for career women who want to wait to have kids -- and four months' leave for new mothers and fathers, matching the tech industry average. Such policies and celebrity CEOs' embrace of them are a publicity boon for these companies and help offset some of the bad publicity such corporate giants regularly incur for, say, a mishandled fake news scandal, the widespread hacking of user data, or, most commonly of late, repeat allegations of workplace harassment.

Whether employees actually use the full benefit remains a question. When they do, it's often thanks to examples from on high, Telle Whitney, president of the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology, tells me: ""Some of these younger companies, like Google and Facebook, as they started to mature and as they became bigger, created paid-leave policies that were very much appreciated by their workforce."" As their workers grew up, she explains, so did their policies. But, says Samantha Walravens, author of Torn: True Stories of Kids, Career & the Conflict of Modern Motherhood, ""If the CEO or executives are not taking their leaves, then it's sending a message to others at the company that it's not okay to take your leave."" Mark Zuckerberg, for example, is on the cusp of his second two-month paternity leave, according to a recent post on his Facebook page. Marissa Mayer sent the opposite message in 2012 when, shortly after becoming Yahoo's president and CEO while pregnant, she built a nursery off her office rather than take a full maternity leave (she took two weeks) or even work from home. Mayer banned remote work for Yahoo employees the following year.

Walravens praises one CEO friend, a notable anti-Mayer. Julia Hartz cofounded the online ticketing company Eventbrite with her husband in 2006 and had her first child in 2008, just when they were looking to hire their first employee. ""I was always on my computer in the hospital, and the nurses threatened to take the computer away and move the baby to the nursery,"" she recalled in a 2010 interview. ""I did not unplug from the business, but I did not go back to the office until I was ready. I worked from home for five months."" In the years since, she's had a second child and, in 2016, became Eventbrite's CEO. Hartz worked from home every Friday and leaned on her mother and a nanny when her first child -- and her company -- were young. She is today a vocal advocate for employees taking their leave and only easing back into work. In Walravens's words, Hartz ""walks the talk.""

So it is that the same Silicon Valley innovators whose revolution outmoded domestic tranquility have also done the best job demanding and receiving time off to take care of their families.

MAKING ENDS MEET

Unlike in the past, there is increasingly little difference between home and office. ""Today I can do most of my work from my phone -- sadly,"" says Van Huysse. The same conveniences that permit the plugged-in home office require parents to respond to their colleagues' emails after putting their children to bed. Our banker Jane remembers waking up in her son's room many hours after his bedtime with her phone furiously pinging in her hand. A young trader was waiting for her signoff on a client presentation.

A mother or father at home during the day is likelier than ever to be working remotely, from a laptop at the dining room table or at a standing desk in the den. Flexible scheduling, telecommuting, and family-friendly hours are common in businesses big and small, according to Lisa Horn, who lobbies Congress for the Society for Human Resource Management. Employees value the freedom to choose their hours and the availability of paid family leave almost equally in rating their benefits, according to a recent Pew survey: 28 percent cite flexible hours first, 27 percent paid leave.

The growing population of work-at-home parents toil in service to an inflated cost of living. The American middle-class family needs as many salaries as it can get today. Yet the benefits of work's encroachment into life's domain may outweigh the losses. Talented women who would, in generations past, have been cowed into the kitchen by convention are maintaining their careers. And men who'd have missed their children's fleeting early years can be present where they would have been absent without getting off the advancement track.

When they first moved to Silicon Valley in the mid-1990s, Van Huysse and her husband worked long hours on bulky desktop computers. Today's increasingly mobile worker has less and less need to be in the office. Sounding not unlike a Republican lawmaker extolling the virtues of a child tax credit expansion, Van Huysse says, ""I want everyone to be able to have the flexibility to make the right choices for themselves and their families.""

AN ISSUE WHOSE TIME HAS COME?

For now, the manifestations of a universal work-life imbalance differ widely enough that sensible people sniff at a socialite like Ivanka Trump's advocating for working women. Ever on-brand, she takes to Twitter to congratulate hedge funds that roll out revamped paid-leave packages. It's easy to say each child deserves as much nurturing as possible in his first weeks of life, regardless of where his parents work. But ""work-life balance"" and paid family leave and pro-family policy translate differently for every profession -- and from every advocate's vantage.

Regardless, it's An Issue Whose Time Has Come -- at least according to the tagline for the AEI-Brookings plan. But so said nearly everyone I talked to on the subject this summer. The time has come to talk about it, to consider what it means for American families and why more than 80 percent of them want Congress to move on the issue. We have to ask and answer how long leave should be, who'll get it, and -- the thorniest thicket of all -- who'll pay for it and, by Grover, how.

Stacey Manes, another Silicon Valley human resources pioneer who now coaches women in tech on pursuing leadership roles and competing with the dominant ""tech bros,"" tells me about her mother. ""I grew up in a household where both parents worked, and my mom definitely carried the bigger share of the laundry, cooking, and cleaning. How in the world did she do it? She worked full-time."" But, Manes realizes, it was an era with very different expectations from the one whose unceasing demands she has built her career helping hardworking men and women manage.

At first, she puzzled over her mother's superhuman ability to run a household and hold a job -- then, ""It dawned on me that she never brought her work home. She was an office manager for a dentist. The day actually ended at 5 o'clock."" And, once again with the recognition that the time has come, she says with a note of mourning, ""That's just not the world we're living in anymore.""

194,194,"If the sound of super-smart robots scares you, what about the prospect of robots that can smell? No, they're not designed to smell your fear, but they are designed to detect explosive residue to help uncover hidden bombs.

One researcher working on the project envisions it as a way to strip back visible security at airports, allowing for smoother passenger experiences when travelling abroad. The modem-sized device, known as the Koniku Kore, could then sit as a silent detector or work as part of a security robot's brain.

Later in Koniku Kore's life, the team plan to employ it in healthcare as a way to detect early signs of diseases through the power of smell. It's a similar idea to how dogs can be used to detect cancer.

A prototype system was unveiled at the TEDGlobal conference in Tanzania, according to the BBC. Creating a computer capable of recognising smells is no easy task. AIs can crunch numbers and make statistical predictions far better than the human brain, but trying to decode smells would require more power than is currently feasible for a portable device. To make Koniku Kore work, its creator Oshi Agabi had to reverse-engineer how the human brain processes smell to make his computer work.

READ MORE: AI versus machine learning: What's the difference?

""Biology is technology. Bio is tech,"" Agabi explained during his presentation. ""Or deep learning networks are all copying the brain.""

What's more unnerving for robophobes is that Agabi's creation is actually a semi-living device. To reduce the amount of power needed for a silicon-based computer to think, his company's creation combines living neurons and silicon capable of detecting and recognising smells.

""You can give the neurons instructions about what to do - in our case, we tell it to provide a receptor that can detect explosives"".

Unfortunately, pictures of the device can't yet be publicly revealed. But by managing to keep the neurons alive, Agabi has managed to overcome one of the biggest problems of building a biological system. He has lofty aims for the technology, too, expanding beyond the boundaries of simply smelling for explosives or illnesses.

""This device can live on a desk and we can keep them alive for a couple of months,"" he told the BBC. ""We think that the processing power that is going to run the robots of the future will be synthetic-biology-based and we are laying the foundations for that today.""

Agabi is far from the first person to try to meld biology and technology to create a new wave of computers. Elon Musk's Neuralink project is quite possibly the most high-profile attempt, looking to meld AI with the human brain, but it's projects like Agabi's that help us come closer to our visions of human-like robots in the future."

What if you could skip tedious airport security lines, while a special device able to sniff out explosives works silently in the background?

This is only one of the possible uses of what Agabi says is the world's first neurotechnology device developed by his Silicon Valley-based start-up Koniku and unveiled at the TEDGlobal conference in Tanzania Sunday (Aug 27).

While those in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are working furiously to create machines that can mimic the brain, or - like tech entrepreneur Elon Musk - implant computers in our brains, Agabi has found a way to merge lab-grown neurons with electronic circuitry.

As many grapple with the finite processing power of silicon, the 38-year-old said he had looked to the brain which is ""the most powerful processor the universe has ever seen.""

To simulate the power of just 204 brain neurons would require a supercomputer, he said.

""Instead of copying a neuron, why not just take the biological cell itself and use it as it is? That thought is radical. The consequence of this is mind-boggling,"" he said.

So he and a team of geneticists, physicists, bio-engineers, molecular biologists and others set about doing just that, focusing on the problems that were particularly hard for silicon devices to solve.

This includes detecting volatile chemicals and explosives or even illnesses such as cancer.

'A WORLD FIRST'

Agabi said the Koniku Kore device is ""a world first"" and able to do just that, essentially through breathing in and smelling the air.

He said ""major brands"", including those in the travel industry, had signed up and the start-up's current revenues of US$8 million were expected to leap to US$30 million by 2018.

One of the main challenges was finding a way to keep the neurons alive, a secret Agabi did not wish to expand on, saying only they could be kept alive for two years in a lab environment and two months in the device.

As AI improves in leaps and bounds, scientists are trying to make and succeeding in making machines more like our brains, able to learn and understand their surroundings: a prospect that is terrifying for many.

Musk, who has repeatedly warned about the perils of AI making humans obsolete, is working on a new project to implant ""neural lace"" brain-interface technology to prevent humans becoming like a ""house cat"" to potential machine masters.

However, Agabi, who grew up in Lagos where he helped his mother sell food on the streets, believes the future of AI lies in making machines more alive.

He believes his company could build a cognitive humanoid system based on synthetic living neurons in the next five to seven years.

""It's not science fiction,"" he told AFP.

""We want to build a brain of biological neurons - an autonomous system that has intelligence. We do not want to build a human brain.""

Agabi did a bachelors degree in theoretical physics in Lagos before taking an interest in neuroscience and bio-engineering for his PhD in London.

200,200,"Sitting most hours of the day is a bane of modern society, and this so-called ""sitting disease"" has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and even breast and colon cancers.

""Our body was designed for physical activity,"" said Dr. Pepito de la Peña, current president of the Philippine Society of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, at the recent whole-day health education forum of Diabetease magazine, which aims to educate diabetic patients and their relatives on how to prevent this disease and its dreaded complications.

""In the past, our ancestors had to do manual labor to eat,"" he added, lamenting that

modern-day amenities and gadgets have changed our previously healthy lifestyle.

""Sitting disease,"" also referred to in medical literature as hypokinetic disease, has literally caused people to be sedentary. If we think about it, we'll be amazed at how long we sit in a day, as we commute to a regular eight-hour desk job. When we go home in the evening, we're too exhausted from work and the traffic, so we unwind by sitting or lying on the couch in front of the television with our remote control, until we go to bed and prepare for another day of sitting.

An Australian study showed that each hour spent watching TV is linked to an increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease by 18 percent.

The convenience of online payment of bills, shopping and other transactions also deprives us of the opportunity to do more walking and less sitting.

There's a move to adopt the ""Take a Stand"" advocacy started in the United States to promote more walking around the workplace for a few minutes every two hours at least. In the US, this practice has reduced sitting time of office workers by 224 percent (66 minutes per day, including the sitting time at home), with upper back and neck pain decreased by 54 percent, and improved efficiency at work, which compensates for the time they stand up to stretch or walk around a bit.

I understand from Dr. De la Peña that there is a proposed bill in Congress proposing a similar undertaking as Take-a-Stand, to allow workers to stretch and walk around every hour. We should support this bill.

""Sitting disease"" may also increase risk of developing cancer. A study several years ago from the American Institute for Cancer Research suggests that nearly 49,000 cases of breast cancer and almost 43,000 cases of colon cancer might be avoided if people were more active and less sedentary. The authors of the study recommend that we should not just do our regular exercise daily, but we should spend less time just sitting for a long stretch.

In another paper, Dr. Neville Owen, from the prestigious Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, estimates that all activities we do while sitting down -- watching TV, doing office work, spending hours glued to computers and gadgets, eating -- add up to 15.5 hours every single day spent just sitting. He explained that with sitting most part of the day, there are some changes in the body predisposing one to cancer.

Dr. Owen explained that such inactivity disturbs the body's metabolism, producing a number of biological signals called biomarkers, which have been associated with the development of cancer, specifically breast and colon cancers.

""It's been surprisingly consistent with what strong relationships there are between physical inactivity and these biomarkers of cancer risk,"" Dr. Owen warned.

When we're more active, we have an enhanced state of well-being, said Dr. De la Peña, who is also a consultant at the East Avenue Medical Center and National Kidney and Transplant Institute.

With a better state of well-being, Dr. De la Peña explained, we can perform daily activities with vigor, reduce risk of various health problems, experience less fatigue and more preparedness in handling ""unfavorable unexpected events in our daily life.""

Although regular exercise is not enough to compensate for a whole day of sitting, it helps reorient our mindset to be active the whole day. Dr. De la Peña gave the following guidelines for exercise:

1) The exercise program must be a life plan, and it should be regular, at least four times a week, 30 minutes to one hour per session.

2) It must progress from light, moderate to more vigorous exercises until the proper fitness level is achieved.

3) Perspiration or sweating hard does not promote fitness. Fitness is developed by exercising the muscles of the body, not the sweat glands. In fact, as discussed in our column last week, it's ideal to exercise with a room temperature of around 16°C.

4) Compute your maximum heart rate (MHR) during exercise as follows: MHR = 220 -- one's age in years. The training heart rate (THR) is 70 to 85 percent of the computed MHR. For middle-age and elderly patients or those with known heart disease, they should consult their doctors first what would be a suitable heart rate goal for them during exercise.

5) If your heart rate does not go down to 120 beats per minute or less after one minute of rest, it's either one has exercised too much or one's heart may have some problems that need to be checked.

So, let's shake a leg and ""take a stand"" against ""sitting disease."""

202,202,"A rainbow of thin wires were tangled up in his matted hair, each one connected to a small probe that would measure the electrical activity in his brain.

We weren't sure if Mr. S was having a seizure, or if he was unable to respond to us for some other reason. As he had been for many days, he lay in his hospital bed, frail and slouched, unable to communicate, often asleep with IV lines dutifully carrying his fluids.

Standing around his bed with six other doctors, discussing what was looking to be a poor prognosis, I couldn't help but wonder -- not why Mr. S was so sick -- but who Mr. S had once been.

When I had admitted him to the hospital a few nights prior, he had severe abnormalities in his electrolytes -- ions in our bodies that have many consequences when out of balance -- and had signs of a pneumonia in his lungs. Both of these could explain why he was unwell from a medical perspective, and why he could no longer verbally tell us his story. In scanning his previous notes, I quickly learned that he had a history of cancer that had metastasized to his brain, requiring surgery, and had fallen a few months earlier, resulting in a bleed in his head. But in reading all of this, I had no more of an idea about who he was and how he came to become the patient in front of me.

This is a problem all residents experience on a daily basis. There is a constant struggle between trying to fully understand the disease that demands our expertise, and a more human need to go deeper and understand more than just ""Mr. S with pneumonia and potential seizure activity.""

I routinely ask my patients how they are feeling, if they have been able to pass urine, gas and poop, if they have had any concerning symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath. But I almost never ask questions that are equally, if not more, important: How was life before you were sick? How does your sickness affect how you view your life now? What were things that used to bring you joy? These types of questions reveal critical information about goals of care, the story behind the development of an illness, the patient's current understanding of their prognosis, and allow the physician to emotionally reflect on a patient's state of wellness.

I recall one day on morning rounds when an especially thoughtful medical student suggested that she bring one of our patients purple flowers -- a small gesture that reminded the patient of her garden at home. As a resident, between time constraints and pressing medical tasks, I hardly have made time for these seemingly ""extra"" needs, but I realize now that to the patient, those flowers were just as essential as which medications we prescribed or which procedures we did. In medicine, it is easy to forget that life is far more than just a beating heart or breathing lungs. We are so much more than the basic physiology that keeps us from dying.

Studies have tried to estimate the amount of time that doctors spend with each patient, with most suggesting only a few minutes (one study in Germany found an average of 4 minutes for hospital encounters). But the exact number is less important than the critical realization that it is far from enough -- and the quality of those interactions isn't always what it should be.

A number of culprits have been discussed in the medical community over the years. Excessively demanding work hours have recently been up for debate again with regard to patient safety and outcomes of care, but studies have failed to examine the effect of these regulations on the physician-patient relationship. Intuitively, one might expect that tired physicians working 28-plus-hour shifts would be less likely to ask about what kind of flowers remind a patient of her garden. This doesn't mean she needs them any less, however. Increasingly heavy demands of documentation and administrative burden have been implicated as well, with a number of studies suggesting residents spend more time on their computers than with a patient on a given day. Ask any of us and we'll assure you that typing away at a computer is not what we aspired to do when we chose a career in medicine.

Part of this reality is that medical diagnostics have changed significantly with the advent of advanced imaging and laboratory tests, which are often very accurate in sniffing out signs of disease. For instance, a century ago, a thorough history and physical exam would be needed to determine if someone was developing pneumonia. Today, while we certainly will inquire about sick contacts and other such risk factors, a heavier emphasis is placed on the chest X-ray or CT scan, and laboratory values that indicate infection. We should absolutely use medical technology to its full potential. But in doing so, some older tenets of medical care, like the social history, inevitably move down the ladder of importance.

Recently, in my clinic in a socioeconomically challenged part of Boston, a number of patients have been presenting with vague aches and pains in their stomach and muscles. Upon further inquiry, there often appears to be no clinical explanation. There often is, however, high levels of stress due to losing a home, a job, a family member to violence, and more. These types of diagnoses don't require thousands of dollars and fancy medical equipment. They do demand a lens that is not fully acquired in medical school alone.

On one of the last days of Mr. S's care, my co-resident walked into our workroom with tears in her eyes. Moments earlier, Mr. S's wife had come to see him and left the hospital room crying. This was not the man she had spent her life with -- the man she fell in love with, had children with, traveled with, hoped to grow old with. Mr. S, with wires on his scalp, his head hunched over his shoulder, his arm beginning to swell from clots in his body, his eyes closed and unlikely to open again soon, if ever -- this was the image of him that I had become used to. But this was not who he was. He was a man, like my own father or uncle or friend -- a man with a past and people who loved him.

It is hard seeing patients when they are at their sickest, and also realizing that they have a life beyond what we witness as their doctors. It is hard to imagine that the lady who sits quietly in the corner of her room was once happily married; that the man with the skin infection was once walking around completely healthy; that the women breathing heavily through pursed lips was once a post-office worker, delivering mail without even a cough.

It is hard to see very sick patients as people who were once healthy, but if we fail to do so, we will only treat diseases instead of the people who are suffering from them."

205,205,"South Africa's mineral resources - some of which are supposedly reaching the end of their lifespan such as gold - may be in for a resurrection as new technologies may lead to the discovery of new deposits hitherto hidden deep underground.

Professor Susan Webb of the University of the Witwatersrand School of Geosciences said using the latest techniques in analysing so-called big data it was thought likely that previously unknown deposits of both precious and base minerals would be discovered which could place South Africa squarely back in the lead as a mining powerhouse.

It could also reveal gas and oil deposits which would be a game changer for the South African economy.

""We have tons of data which still needs to be analysed and it is likely that these datasets, as well as new data coming in from a variety of sources including satellites and ground stations, will provide us with clues as to where these deposits are located.""

The newfound sense of optimism is not limited to scientists and academics. Anglo American group director, technical and sustainability, Tony O'Neill recently told a prominent mining journal that big data was a ""low-hanging fruit just within our grasp"". ""For the first time in my 36-year career in mining, I feel we're on the cusp of an explosion of game-changing technology,"" he said. The opportunities presented by big data and other key technologies were enormous, he said.

Moyo Business Advisory, a Centurion firm of business consultants have played a major role in introducing new technologies for the processing and analysis of so-called big data in South Africa.

Dewald Lindeque, Business Development Director at Moyo Business Advisory, said his company had devised big data business solutions for some of the largest companies in South Africa that had in many respects revolutionised the way they do business.

""The amazing thing with big data is that you can accurately predict events that have not yet happened and devise plans on how to capitalise on those events. It can be applied to everything ranging from the discovery of new mineral resources to the streamlining of business processes in the corporate sector.

""It has also been used with great success in the scientific field in the development of new drugs such as a procedure to modify T cells in the human genome to fight leukaemia as well as in the decoding of the human genome to help fight genetic diseases.""

The latest addition to their family of products is a system that uses computer graphics cards and specialised database management software rather than ever larger and more expensive computers to process and analyse big data.

""Through our partnership with SQream Technologies in Israel, we have shown the enormous potential of big data in the business, mining, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and retail sectors. It also has enormous potential in the scientific field such as processing the vast amount of data generated in the field of cancer research and in the search for new life-saving drugs.

Lindeque said the importance of computing on this massive scale was vitally important for the corporate world where big data had been earmarked as the next great leap forward to help the business community to maximise profits and reduce costs by effectively using information companies already had resident on their databases.

Using big data, scientists have already discovered new mineral deposits and the technology could be widely applied to exploration, they wrote in the journal American Mineralogist.

""Big data points to new minerals, new deposits,"" they wrote of the findings.

A scientific paper published in the American Mineralogist recently proved beyond doubt that big data could find new mineral deposits.

""The quest for new mineral deposits is incessant, but until recently mineral discovery has been more a matter of luck than scientific prediction,"" said co-author Dr Shaunna Morrison of the Deep Carbon Observatory and the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington."

209,209,"FDA reviewing efficacy of tests against standard blood draws

A Stanford University dropout wants to change blood testing with a machine that promises precise results from a fingerprick.

This is not the story of Elizabeth Holmes's Theranos Inc. -- which soared to fame and then just as spectacularly crashed to Earth two years ago. With this new startup, some investors believe, things will be different.

Tanay Tandon and co-founder Deepika Bodapati, who dropped out of the University of Southern California, have raised $3.7 million from investors led by venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital to kickstart their company, Athelas, named for the healing plant in ""The Lord of the Rings."" The founders, who are 20 and 22, respectively, say that their portable blood analyzer, a black cylinder that looks a lot like Amazon Inc.'s Echo device, can run a complete blood-cell count from a fingerprick test done at home.

Tandon said he's learned from the collapse of Theranos, which attained a $9 billion valuation and fawning press coverage despite sharing little about how its technology actually worked. When Theranos's innovations proved illusory, its value cratered as investors fled.

""Theranos proved there was clear interest in the space -- it would have been a great company if it worked,"" he said. ""Now, investors say they need proof before we can raise money.""

Athelas has published initial data comparing traditional laboratory results to its technology, which captures high-resolution images of a blood sample, then uses a computer to tag and count the cells. Its process relies on machine learning. Tandon amassed thousands of images of blood cells labeled by pathologists and fed them to computers to train them to distinguish between different types of cells, which he says will have greater precision than standard testing.

The company has submitted data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and hopes to receive clearance this year verifying that its technology produces results equivalent to blood drawn from a vein and tested on industry-standard equipment. For now, its device can be used by patients for medical decisions as long as a pathologist verifies any test results. Gaining clearance from the FDA would allow Athelas to sell its device over the counter, according to Tandon.

Early believers include two major pharmaceutical companies that have signed deals to explore Athelas's device as a test to help find more patients for their white blood cell-boosting drugs, said Tandon, who declined to name the companies.

Alfred Lin, the Sequoia partner advising Athelas, envisions the product being used in emergency rooms, becoming as ubiquitous as a thermometer.

""Our thesis is it will get adopted because it will drive costs down and provide a better customer experience,"" said Lin. ""Time will tell.""

Until insurers agree to cover the cost, patients will have to pay $20 a month for the home-testing service. Athelas plans to first focus on cancer patients, who need frequent blood draws to monitor white blood cell counts, which show the immune system's strength. Tandon said he hopes oncologists will recommend the device to patients.

Doctors interviewed by Bloomberg News were intrigued but had reservations.

Cancer patients typically need to get their white blood cell counts measured before starting a round of chemotherapy. Being able to test before traveling for a treatment could prevent hassle.

""It's pretty demoralizing to get into the car, drive three hours to be told your blood count's too low, please come back next week,"" said Scott Kopetz, an assistant professor of medical oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. ""Reducing those cases could be a benefit.""

White blood cell counts are critical when cancer patients develop a fever, because a low count means they're vulnerable to infection, according to Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. However, Brawley says he'd typically tell such patients to come into the hospital anyway, so Athelas's device wouldn't save them a trip.

Patients ""could just collapse on you, so we have to figure out their white count before we let them leave,"" Brawley said.

Beyond the matter of convenience, if Athelas doesn't integrate seamlessly into existing electronic medical-record systems, most doctors would reject it because they don't want to deal with separate software, said Kopetz. Bypassing a clinic visit may also hurt a doctor's bottom line.

""My business manager would be upset because we can't charge the patient for that visit,"" said Brawley.

Peter Eisenberg, an oncologist at Marin Cancer Care in California, said the current lack of insurance coverage was a dealbreaker for him. ""I'm not going to tell patients to buy anything if their insurance doesn't cover it,"" he said. For a patient who lives in a remote area, ""yeah, sure, put one in that patient's home,"" he said. ""But there's no burning need at all."""

214,214,"ST. GEORGE - Though the Intermountain Cancer Center being built next door to Dixie Regional Medical Center is a year away from completion, the cutting-edge research slated to take place within its walls is already well underway at the Intermountain Precision Genomics laboratory just down the road.

Located in the upper floors of the Rim Rock Plaza on Medical Center Drive in St. George, medical oncologists and researchers work to unlock ways to find the best options to treat cancers through precision medicine - a fancy term for customized, personalized treatment tailored to an individual patient's needs.

Precision genomics takes the concept of personalized care a little further.

""Precision genomics means selecting personalized or individualized treatments for a patient based on their unique molecular- or DNA-makeup,"" laboratory Executive Director Dr. Lincoln Nadauld said.

Genomics is a study of DNA that focuses on finding out what changes to DNA, or mutations, have taken place to generate a disease, he said. Once those mutated genes are identified, specific medications can be recommended to help treat a specific patient's cancer through the use of immunotherapy and other treatments.

""(Immunotherapy) is a strategy to help your immune system find your cancer and kill your cancer cells,"" laboratory Director of Immuno-oncology Dr. Terence Rhodes said.

Cancerous cells that would otherwise remain unnoticed by the immune system are revealed through the use of drugs, a process that typically takes nine to 12 weeks to see if a drug applied is working, Rhodes said. However, paired with precision genomics, oncologists are able to see if a patient's cancer is susceptible to certain immunotherapy treatments before any drugs are used.

""Together, through those two strategies, we may be able to help our patients live longer and healthier lives,"" Rhodes said.

While some patients may be able to forego chemotherapy in favor of immunotherapy, Nadauld said, a patient may still be found to benefit from a mix of treatments that includes chemotherapy and radiation.

From research to application

Both Nadauld and Rhodes are medical scientists in addition to being oncologists. As such, they take part in the research being done at Intermountain's laboratory. A large part of what its precision genomics program hopes to achieve is to take discoveries made in the lab and apply them to patient care.

""We've developed a process that can help patients directly,"" Nadauld said.

Physicians can order a genetic test of a tumor sample offered to Precision Genomics for examination by a board of specialists brought together by Intermountain Healthcare with Precision Genomics.

The board, which includes Nadauld and Rhodes, analyzes the genetic data taken from the tumor sample and then makes specific recommendations based on those findings. The general turnaround from the lab receiving the sample to a treatment recommendation is about 16 days.

Patients who typically benefit from this testing are those with late-stage cancers who have ""run out of options,"" Nadauld said. For them, their cancers may have become resistant to drugs that had previously worked, so a new treatment needs to be found.

Nadauld shared an example of a man in his 40s with late-stage colon cancer.

""Unfortunately, his cancer became resistant to various chemotherapies,"" Nadauld said. ""It was continuing to grow despite our treatments and there wasn't much time left.""

DNA testing was done and it was discovered the cancer was susceptible to drugs generally used for breast cancer. Once those drugs were applied, the patient's quality of life greatly improved.

""It worked. It worked great. His tumors all started shrinking,"" Nadauld said with enthusiasm. He felt so much better .... We found him a treatment that gave him more time, more quality time.""

The man improved to the point he was able to return to work and also experience family milestones like seeing his children graduate from high school. His cancer did later become resistant to the new treatment and he died, but not before his life was improved through precision genomics treatment.

That man's case is just one of many the board examines, some involving people in the St. George area, others from across the United States.

""We're receiving and analyzing dozens of tests every week, from all over the county,"" Nadauld said.

Translating the genome

When examining tumor DNA, oncologists typically focus on 162 genes known to be associated with cancer pathway mutations. They tend to ignore the approximate 20,000 genes that make up the human genome.

However, that overall makeup is being sequenced and analyzed by the Translational Science Center at Precision Genomics in order to provide a bigger picture that oncologists and researchers will be able to draw from for their purposes.

Helaman Escobar, director of Translational Science and Research, said the center's personnel look for overall patterns in the genome beyond the 162 known genes that may contribute to cancer.

""We're trying to find out what mutations are meaningful so future doctors can use that to make medical decisions,"" Escobar said, adding that the subsequent research will aid doctors in figuring out why cancers behave certain ways or are susceptible to certain drugs while being resistant to others.

Part of what the center is doing is sequencing genetic information from over 4 million tumor samples from patients stored by Intermountain Healthcare over the last 40 years. Called the ""biorepository,"" the samples are kept in a basement facility in Salt Lake City.

The large population of samples in the biorepository provides doctors and medical scientists the wherewithal to work and draw comparisons to current cases. Further unlocking the genetic profiles of particular tumors from years past can also help doctors see what treatment may or may not have proven effective in combating the disease at the time.

The biorepository helps build a foundation on which the precision genomics program can move forward, with Escobar and others working to unlock genetic information along the way.

""We are bringing state-of-the-art technology to St. George, it's really exciting,"" Escobar said. ""We'll have the ability to sequence thousands of genomes a year, and that's a big feature. Genomes require a lot of sequencing, a lot of lab work to be able to generate that much data.""

Stanford partnership

An aspect of the Intermountain Precision Genomics program that is often highlighted by Intermountain officials is its partnership with Stanford University. The partnership has produced a satellite laboratory of the Stanford Genome Technology Center, currently housed at the Rim Rock Plaza.

Collaborative work is being done on producing technology and tools related to genetic sequencing, including a program called ""informatics.""

Informatics will better enable computers to read genetic data compiled from sequencing, Escobar said.

""Imagine sequencing a genome like generating a book with thousands of pages of letters you cannot read. So the 'informatics,' that comes after the lab as to deciphering what is actually written in the book,"" Escobar said. ""And because we're deciphering genomes, we want to look at what words in that book have been misspelled - those are the mutations.""

The Stanford partnership helps put Intermountain Healthcare on the cutting edge of research and technology, Rhodes said, adding it will greatly aid in taking research to the next step of clinical application.

""Stanford innovates and we integrate,"" Rhodes said. ""We're able to take all their smarts and technology and discoveries and apply them to patient care.""

Intermountain Healthcare is also a part of the Oncology Precision Network, or OPeN, a collaboration with Stanford Cancer Institute, Providence Health & Services and Syapse. According to the network's website, the group ""aims to find breakthroughs in cancer care by leveraging previously untapped real-world cancer genomics data.""

Providing hope to those to who have ""run out of options""

Nadauld, Rhodes and Escobar each said they were excited to be a part of the precision genomics program and take part in the research as well as the ultimate goal of applying the research and discoveries wrought from it to patient care.

For the time being, precision genomics is primarily used to find treatments for late-stage cancer patients who have run out of options, Nadauld said. Like the man with colon cancer he mentioned, they may become resistant to a standard from of treatment and need something new in order to improve their quality of life.

""I think patients want to feel hope and that they are not alone and that they have help in their battle,"" Nadauld said. ""... We feel like what we have built in this lab - the capabilities that we have, the teams that we've built - is offering hope to patients that they wouldn't have otherwise. We're offering hope to patients in a tangible way.""

As for early-stage cancers, Nadauld said, medical science is very good about treating and even curing those conditions through surgery, medications and other means. New treatment options are also being approved by the Food and Drug Administration every day, he said.

Finding treatment options for other maladies is another benefit of precision genomics moving forward. While its current focus largely deals with cancer, Intermountain Precision Genomics Operations Officer Gary Stone said research and discoveries made through the genomics lab will ultimately help physicians make applications to other conditions as well.

""We're building a facility here that will be on part with the top bio-tech locations in the world,"" Escobar said, ""so it's pretty unique.""

215,215,"Healthtech IoT startup Doxper has raised $750K in a Seed round of funding led by Vidal Health and growx ventures. Other investors who participated in the round include Capier Investments, Globevestor as well as private individuals in the medical space.

As per the terms of the deal, Girish Rao, MD of Vidal Healthcare and Siddharth Dhondiyal representing growx ventures have also joined the company's board of directors.

Commenting on the decision, Girish Rao and Siddharth Dhondiyal said, ""Doxper is trying to solve a problem that is inherent and specific to developing countries like India and not blatantly copying what's applicable in the west and replicating here. The problem of not recording healthcare data in digital format is an expensive one and when solved has benefits of exponential proportions.""

Gurugram-based Doxper plans to use the newly raised funds to scale up operations and enhance the technology platform, according to an official statement.

Using Old School Pen And Paper To Modernise Patient Records And Management In Indian Healthcare

Founded by three IIT alumni Randeep Singh, Shailesh Prithani and Pawan Jain in January 2016, InformDS Technologies Pvt. Ltd runs Doxper.

Doxper is a pen-and-paper smart solution for doctors that uses an aluminum and stainless steel-coated 'pen' that records data such as prescriptions, patient histories etc. on encoded paper with the help of data science algorithms. As per the website, the pen can hold the data of 1,000 prescriptions at a time and works on auto-power. The solution fits seamlessly into the existing clinical workflow without altering any step of the doctor-patient interaction. This data is then automatically transferred to the cloud, where doctors can easily access it on multiple platforms.

""The simplicity of the solution is the biggest USP of Doxper. While almost all the computer or tablet based EMRs/EHRs have failed to get any significant traction with doctors, specialists & super specialists, Doxper is receiving momentous attraction from all the doctors and even KOLs as pen and paper resonates with them way more than computers or tablets,"" added the investors Rao and Dhondhiyal.

Doxper is actively servicing doctors in Delhi/NCR, Jaipur, Pune, Bengaluru and Mumbai currently.

It has an easy scheduling and management system for healthcare practitioners to effectively manage their patients. Doxper also has an API solution for hospitals to integrate into their systems to keep track of patient records in ICU, Emergency, Casualty and OPD departments. And, for patients, it plans to be a one-stop platform where they can access medical reports and other related information.

Due to the unique and simplistic solution offered by Doxper, it has managed to gain a fair amount of traction in a little over a year. According to the official statement, over 400 leading physicians and specialists have become users including AIIMS Breast Cancer Clinic, Prashanti Cancer Care Mission, Biocon Foundation and others.

Talking about the funding, co-founder Shailesh Prithani said, ""The vision is to make Doxper the de-facto choice for healthcare digitisation in India and other emerging markets. Capital raised will be deployed to improve or add more layers on top of the current technology stack including machine learning, handwriting recognition and AI for better care outcomes.""

What's Happening In Indian Healthcare

According to a report by IBEF, the Indian healthcare market will rise to $280 Bn by 2020, from the current $100 Bn. One reason for this is the adoption of data and IoT-based digital solutions, such as Doxper.

Innovaccer is one of the leading players in the healthtech analytics space. It reportedly serves over 2 Mn patients across the country. Since 2012, the startup has amassed more than $15.6 Mn in funding. Doxper competes with a number of startups such as Mumbai-based IoT healthcare device marker Zoctr, Lybrate, and Tricog.

The industry too has attracted investor interest in the last two years. Healthtech secured $197 Mn funding in H1 2017, according to Inc42 Data Labs report.

Huzaifa Khorakiwala, Executive Director at Wockhardt has recently announced the launch of a $19 Mn Health Passion fund, which will exclusively invest in Indian healttech startups. Avendus Finance too has launched a $78.5 Mn fund through its NBFC to invest in Indian industry and healthcare. Recent big ticket fundings in healthtech belonged to HealthCare atHOME which raised $38.5 Mn from Quadria Capital, and Medwell Ventures which secured $21 Mn in Series B from a number of investors.

Doxper certainly has a unique proposition, parlaying old school pen and paper and the physical act of writing doctor's notes into the electronic space. Its other offerings too cater to the doctor-patient workflow, be it hospitals and hospital administrations, individual healthcare practitioners as well as patients. The multi-billion potential of the healthtech industry too has been documented. But it now remains to be seen how Doxper can utilise the funding to take its solution beyond the metro cities i.e. Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and focus more on the Tier II cities such as Jaipur, Pune and more to solve the problems of maintaining patient records there."
216,216,"Nigerian neuroscientist Oshiorenoya Agabi may have found a way to solve one of life's puzzling dilemmas: how to make air travel pleasant again.

What if you could skip tedious airport security lines, while a special device able to sniff out explosives works silently in the background?

This is only one of the possible uses of what Agabi says is the world's first neurotechnology device developed by his Silicon Valley-based start-up Koniku and unveiled at the TEDGlobal conference in Tanzania on Sunday.

While those in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are working furiously to create machines that can mimic the brain, or - like tech entrepreneur Elon Musk - implant computers in our brains, Agabi has found a way to merge lab-grown neurons with electronic circuitry.

As many grapple with the finite processing power of silicon, the 38-year-old said he had looked to the brain which is ""the most powerful processor the universe has ever seen"".

To simulate the power of just 204 brain neurons would require a supercomputer, he said.

""Instead of copying a neuron, why not just take the biological cell itself and use it as it is? That thought is radical. The consequence of this is mind-boggling,"" he said.

So he and a team of geneticists, physicists, bio-engineers, molecular biologists and others set about doing just that, focusing on the problems that were particularly hard for silicon devices to solve.

This includes detecting volatile chemicals and explosives or even illnesses such as cancer.

'A world first'

Agabi said the Koniku Kore device is ""a world first"" and able to do just that, essentially through breathing in and smelling the air.

He said ""major brands"", including those in the travel industry, had signed up and the start-up's current revenues of $8 million (7 million euros) were expected to leap to $30 million by 2018.

One of the main challenges was finding a way to keep the neurons alive, a secret Agabi did not wish to expand on, saying only they could be kept alive for two years in a lab environment and two months in the device.

As AI improves in leaps and bounds, scientists are trying to make and succeeding in making machines more like our brains, able to learn and understand their surroundings: a prospect that is terrifying for many.

Musk, who has repeatedly warned about the perils of AI making humans obsolete, is working on a new project to implant ""neural lace"" brain-interface technology to prevent humans becoming like a ""house cat"" to potential machine masters.

However, Agabi, who grew up in Lagos where he helped his mother sell food on the streets, believes the future of AI lies in making machines more alive.

He believes his company could build a cognitive humanoid system based on synthetic living neurons in the next five to seven years. ""It's not science fiction,"" he told AFP.

""We want to build a brain of biological neurons - an autonomous system that has intelligence. We do not want to build a human brain.""

Agabi did a bachelors degree in theoretical physics in Lagos before taking an interest in neuroscience and bio-engineering for his PhD in London.

African innovation at TED

He spoke at the opening session of the four-day TEDGlobal conference, putting African ideas, innovation and creativity in the spotlight with a variety of speakers who each get an 18-minute window to get across their message of choice.

TED - originally known as Technology, Entertainment and Design - has built a global following for its online videos of inspiring talks devoted to ""ideas worth spreading"".

""Africa has experienced spectacular economic, demographic and creative growth, but both opportunity and danger are rising at an exponential rate. Our conference will gather the idea catalysts, problem-solvers and change-makers already hard at work here charting Africa's own path to modernity."""

Answer from C Stuart Hardwick, Award-Winning Scifi Author:

Why is there no race to land man on Mars like the race to the Moon? Largely because those in the position to fund such a race have seen the bill for the last one. During the 1960s the space program consumed 5% of the federal budget -- competing with the expensive cancer of war in southeast Asia.

It needn't have been so, but the race to beat the USSR gave the moonshot the character of a wartime weapons procurement program -- sufficient to do the job, but damn the expense. That was sort of the point. It gave the electorate new heroes something to rally around and helped transition America's post war industrial economy into a technological powerhouse.

It also taught us how hard space flight really is -- especially manned spaceflight -- and in our national exuberance, made it seen more expensive than it needed to be. We built the space flight equivalent of the SR-71 spy plane (mission capable, but expensive and custom made) where we needed a DC3 (mass produced but adaptable) and only knew how to build the Wright Flyer. Congress didn't quite appreciate how much we were biting off.

The program did what it was hoped it would. Even as a controversial war and deteriorating race relations pulled America apart, Apollo bound us together, not just with each other, but with everyone else on the planet. One could argue that this alone was worth the price of the program, but we did get a bit carried away.

NASA had designed Apollo to meet Kennedy's mandate, but they spent money on studies of follow on lunar bases, space stations, LEM-derived space freighters, and upgrades to Saturn that from an economic perspective, made as much sense as building a fleet of disposable battleships.

Meanwhile, the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office had developed and tested an atomic thermal rocket and was advocating to have it developed into an atomic third stage for the Saturn, to send man to Mars in the 1970s.

Having seen the ballooning costs so far, Congress was horrified. We had already ""won"" as far as they were concerned, having gotten to the moon and back, and everything else (including science) was just dollars and danger.

This, I believe, left congress with a ""bad aftertaste"" that lasted well into the 1990s. Sure, they thought, NASA can do great things, but who can afford them? NASA negotiated a compromise. They traded their grandiose dreams for Skylab and the Shuttle, with the hopes that this would lead to and justify a later station, and from there...

In hindsight, it's hard to see how NASA planners, faced with dwindling interest and funding in the 1960s, thought anything they could achieve in low Earth orbit would restore the interest and the funding of their gravy days in the lead up to Apollo 11. In retrospect, they might have done better to set themselves a vision much more humble, but in its own way just as lofty, as the moonshot: developing economical space flight technology.

Alas, they were given what they asked for -- the shuttle -- morphed by committee into a sort of Swiss-Army Knife relaunchable space station that ultimately may have done as much to reinforce our national sense of sticker shock as to advance the final frontier.

So, when subsequent presidents have sought to challenge NASA with bold new missions... the funding has never materialized. Partly because of a lack of political commitment. Partly, though, it's because LBJ is gone.

Kennedy proposed the moon landing, and ultimately Kennedy is the one who initiated international cooperation in space, but more than anyone else alive, Lyndon B. Johnson championed the moon landings. According to NASA insiders, it was LBJ who, when Kennedy was fishing for a win in space, told Kennedy to send a memo officially asking him -- as vice president -- for ideas. It was in response that he (LBJ) suggested the moon landing. And after Kennedy consulted with the experts, it was LBJ who strong-armed congress into writing the checks. It was said of LBJ, ""Nobody wanted to say no to LBJ. He knew everyone on the hill, and he knew where all the bodies were buried.""

The Cold War was over, and we both won and lost. We won by using the power of capitalism to spend the hard line communists controlling the USSR under the table in history's greatest economic drinking competition. We lost by failing utterly to help Russian moderates -- who had known this was inevitable for decades -- to transition their country into a strong, stable, nation with the same incentives to innovation, but also the same controls against corruption and excess we had come by through hard knocks -- and now seem determined to dismantle. So instead of taking advantage of a historic opportunity to join strategic forces with a great global power, we trade cheap shots between a former reality TV star and a former KGB agent, each with his own nuclear arsenal. And we wonder why people dream of leaving the planet.

But I digress.

The moon landings were arguably the greatest thing ever done for the wrong reasons. We, as a nation, did it right, even carrying along rovers and a geologist. Sure, Congress wanted to put a thumb in the eye of the Kremlin, but America, from Kennedy down to the people, saw that for the first time since humans first walked out under that glowing thing in the sky, we could go there. So we did.

That was the good part. The moon landings not only inspired the generations who participated, but every generation since. They also paid dividends that are far less visible but far more important than the oft-touted spin-offs like CFL lighting and the acceleration of microcomputer research.

The Apollo program required ""rocket science"" of over 1,500 companies throughout the US economy, from the brassiere makers to foundries. The high-tolerance, high reliability engineering and manufacturing controls developed for and disseminated by the space program now inform all of manufacturing, from flat-pack furniture that goes together the first time and every time, to cars that don't rattle and drive 150,000 miles without a tuneup, to pocket computers 10,000 times more powerful than those that went to the moon.

The race was the bad part. It made everything far more expensive than it might have been. But maybe that's the way it had to be. Something else the space race did was illustrate with crystal clarity how, despite the creative capacity unleashed by free enterprise, despite the inefficiencies often inherent in centralized control, sometimes greatness requires both. At the moment, NASA seems to get that, and is embracing its role as a foil and champion of commercial innovators, even while working on the next great booster -- beyond the reach of commercial interests.

The last thing we need is another space race. Let's take our time. And this time, when we get there, when we press human feet against another world, let us stay.

229,229,"Those who knew the late brothers Dave and Mike Kneubehl likely were aware of their love for all things ""Star Wars"" - especially Darth Vader - but also knew how the siblings moved through their lives reaching out to others.

""They were very friendly and bubbly, and they loved 'Star Wars,'"" Cindy Kneubehl of New Castle, Pa., recalled about Dave and Mike, who died in 2002 and 2012 at age 24 and 31, respectively, after having lost their battles against cystic fibrosis.

Given the brothers' love for one of popular culture's most iconic villains, it probably came as no surprise that their mother was part of Team Vader, one of more than 220 teams that made up Sunday morning's Panerathon 2017 10K and 2-mile walk and run that began and ended at the Covelli Centre.

An estimated 11,000 people participated in the eighth annual event to raise money for the Joanie Abdu Comprehensive Breast Care Center at St. Elizabeth Youngstown Hospital, the only facility of its kind in the city. The Panerathon also is the Mahoning Valley's largest community fundraiser, organizers say.

Sunday's event should bring the amount raised over eight years to more than $2 million, money that will support Joanie's Promise, set up to ""ensure every woman in the Valley, regardless of ability to pay, will get an assessment and treatment,"" noted Ashlee Mauti, marketing director for Covelli Enterprises Inc.

""Together with our sponsors, participants and spectators, we have made a real difference in reducing the number of breast-cancer deaths in the tri-county area,"" noted Candace Madden of Boardman-based Mercy Health Foundation Mahoning Valley, which supports the JACBCC.

Funds from the Panerathon also helped to buy a state-of-the-art mobile mammography van that travels three days a week and sees about 20 patients each day, she explained. During its first year in operation, more than 500 mammograms have been performed; also, eight patients have been diagnosed with cancer and treated before it could advance, Mauti said.

""He never wanted to be defined by the disease. Church was important to Dave,"" said his father, Bob Kneubehl, who added his son worked as an information-technology specialist at Victory Christian Center in Coitsville, with a goal of becoming a pastor.

For his part, Mike Kneubehl was ""an IT guy, too, and he liked computers,"" Bob said.

In addition, Bob and Cindy Kneubehl came to the event on behalf of friends and family members with breast cancer, Cindy said, adding that they have been in all eight Panerathons.

""She was heavily involved with our schools, sporting events, fundraisers for school and school trips,"" Jeff Bevan of Cold Spring, Ky., said about his mother, Pati Bevan, a breast-cancer survivor who works for Leebaw Manufacturing Co. in Canfield. ""Anything we're involved in, she's always there and always makes time for us.""

Jeff and his brothers, Mike and Steve, along with Pati's husband, Rick, and her parents, Jim and Barb Lawson, were among those who showed their love and support for Pati by being part of Team Pat.

""She's very family-oriented. She would do anything for anybody,"" added Mike, who, along with Jeff, played on Chaney High School's basketball team.

Jeff said his mother has been cancer-free for about a year after having first been diagnosed with skin cancer and then breast cancer about five years ago. His main reason for being part of the Panerathon, however, extended beyond his immediate family.

""I hope this event helps everyone,"" he added. ""I hope we don't have to worry about this anymore.""

Before the walk and run, organizers called for a moment of silence to remember those who have lost their battle with cancer, as well as to honor survivors.

As Tropical Storm Harvey continues to batter Southeast Texas and floods the Houston area, everyday Texans are trying to keep their heads above water. Their homes are inundated, their neighborhood streets are under chest-deep water, and many roads and highways are completely impassable. Some are waiting for rescue, others are wading out on foot, most are bracing for massive rains that are expected to continue for days.

'We train hard for this. It's what we do.'

Commander Toney Wade and his Cajun Coast Search and Rescue team, a volunteer group from Louisiana, made it to Dickinson, Tex., where they rescued 25 people, some of whom were stuck in a two-story hotel.

Wade said that more than 10,000 people needed to be rescued in that area, which is halfway between Houston and Galveston, on the Gulf of Mexico.

""It was really something -- just something to see -- trucks and cars you can barely see under the water,"" he said in a telephone interview.

He and 16 other men and women, some with military and many with firefighter and emergency medical technician experience packed up and left to help with five shallow draft boats, a high-water rescue boat and one air boat.

""We train hard for this,"" he said. ""It's what we do. And at first light tomorrow, we will back at it.""

'A gush of water that came up too fast'

Nichelle Mosby stood up to her knees in floodwater in the parking lot of the Marriott Courtyard Hotel in Southwest Houston, grimacing with a towel over her head to block the rain.

""We were supposed to be leaving this morning -- and this happened,"" she said midmorning Sunday, looking out across a deluged parking lot toward the Residence Inn next door, which was flooded with more than two feet of water.

Mosby and six family members, including a 4-year-old girl, had come from Louisiana to visit relatives. When Harvey hit, they booked into the Courtyard and were now stranded with dozens of other guests.

""We went through Katrina, but this feels different,"" she said. Instead of a gradual buildup of rising water, she said, ""this was like a gush of water that came up too fast.""

Mosby stood among a few dozen cars in the parking lot, which were mostly flooded up to their windows. A few drivers had moved their cars to the only high ground, just in front of the lobby door. But as a hard rain continued to fall, the water seemed to be creeping toward the door as well -- with the potential to flood the lobby.

A woman walks through floodwaters outside a Residence Inn in Houston. (Kevin Sullivan/The Washington Post)

Inside the lobby, families huddled around TVs playing the Weather Channel and local news, watching officials warn people to stay off city streets. Next to the hotel, the Braes Bayou raged downstream carrying large chunks of debris. Its level had risen 10 or 20 feet since the day before, swamping downstream bridges, plus all roads and a huge park close by.

For dozens of guests at the hotel, there was no way to leave. Water in the parking lot rose quickly to about three feet deep, and it was deeper out on the roadway, where several abandoned cars sat completely swamped.

In the lobby, John McMillian, 70, sat eating breakfast with his wife, Debbie McMillian, 64, and their daughter, Tara, 29.

They were in town so John McMillian could have five days of treatment for his leukemia at MD Anderson Cancer Center just down the road. He had three days of treatment and was supposed to have his fourth on Sunday, but now they were stranded.

""If push came to shove, we could always wade to the hospital,"" he said.

""I'm not going to let him, don't worry,"" his wife added.

With the McMillians said they were prepared for a long stay in the hotel for the long haul because John McMillian needs his next two days of treatment. They had seen the reports about the impending storm, so Tara had packed them plenty of extra food and water at home in Beaumont, Tex.

""We knew this was a possibility,"" Debbie McMillian said. ""We've been through a lot of hurricanes, but we've never been stuck like this.""

She said her brand new Acura was underwater in the parking lot.

""I haven't even made the first payment on it yet,"" she said.

As people sat chatting quietly, phones buzzed with emergency signals urging people to take shelter because of a tornado watch. The entire Houston area has been under near-constant tornado warnings for two days.

Anual Wisdom and his wife, Sandra, from Oklahoma, sat eating breakfast a few tables away in the lobby. Their 39-year-old son had surgery for brain cancer at MD Anderson on Wednesday.

They arrived on Aug. 20 and parked their small RV at a campground about 14 miles up the road, but they haven't seen it since. They spent the first few nights in the hospital room with their son, then when Harvey started pelting rain they couldn't get back to their RV. So they spent Friday night sleeping in their car in the hospital parking garage, and moved to the Marriott Courtyard for Saturday night.

Their son was supposed to be released from the hospital Saturday, but doctors have now ordered him to stay there until the storm emergency passes. The Wisdoms want to be with him, but they are stranded at the hotel.

""We have prepped for the hotel room,"" Sandra said. ""We bought extra food and water, we came down here and bought snacks. We filled the bathtub with water so we can flush the toilet if we have to.""

They said they'd ridden out lots of tornadoes in Oklahoma in the past.

""But this is kind of crazy,"" Sandra said. ""It's bad enough to have to come down when your son has brain surgery, but to have to go through a hurricane too is a little much.""

The unicorn floatie

Since Thursday, Sarah and Eric Fisher prepared for his older brother's wedding. It was supposed to be on Saturday at The Farmhouse in Montgomery, near Lake Conroe, just over an hour's drive north of Houston.

It was supposed to be a weekend of fun. They'd rented a lake house. That explains the inflatable unicorn in Sarah's car. But when news of Harvey stalling above the greater Houston area broke, guests called to say they couldn't make it.

Vendors began to cancel. The bride was devastated. The wedding was postponed.

So Sarah and her husband and her parents, Laura and Tim Schuur, headed back to her parents' home in Spring.

They made it just in time to move the furniture upstairs. The rain began and by 8 a.m., their house started to flood. It covered their hardwood floors, up to their ankles and closer and closer to the mailbox.

Like a year ago when their home flooded after a storm, Sarah, her husband and her parents knew they'd need to evacuate.

Jack, a poodle, and Daisy, a bulldog, came first on an inflatable tube that was meant to be pulled behind a boat on Lake Conroe.

Jack and Daisy.

Laura wore a pink inner tube around her waist. And that unicorn floatie, the one Sarah used at her best friend's engagement party at the lake a few weeks ago, turned into a way to save her family's possessions.

So they walked two miles, for nearly 20 minutes, in water that rose between their waists and their chests before they were rescued by family friends.

""In the last flood, we got about eight inches,"" Sarah said. ""This time, we think we'll get double that.""

By now, the water is above the mailbox and the blue truck parked out front has water almost to the top of the cab.

But Sarah and her family are 15 miles northwest, at her grandfather's home. There, the pups are asleep and her family is safe and the unicorn floatie is deflated under the covered back porch.

Watching the floodwaters rise

Michael Peraza, 17, slept at a friend's house Saturday night after watching the boxing match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor. He awoke to messages from his mom telling him that water had started to seep into the house.

Michael and his friends walked each other home through flooded streets in Westfield. When he arrived, he was shocked to see several inches of water in the place he has called home for 10 years. His mother unplugged everything and collected a few treasured items while his sister called for help.

""My sister started calling as soon as it started flooding around 9 a.m., and nothing was getting through,"" Peraza said. ""We kept calling all the numbers that were listed on television.""

The family decided to leave on foot just after 4 p.m., with Peraza and his sister each carrying one of her children, ages 4 and 7. The family didn't have a destination in mind, they just knew they didn't want to be stuck in the house as the floodwater continued to rise.

""We just decided to leave on pure instinct,"" Peraza said.

When they got to the end of Anice Street, where they live, they heard a horn and followed it. Around the corner, they spotted a high-water rescue truck staffed by local firefighters and Army Reserve members. The family joined nearly 20 other evacuees in the back of the truck and made their way to the Red Cross shelter at M.O. Campbell Center on Aldine Bender.

Peraza said that with more than 200 people already at the shelter, there wouldn't be enough cots for everyone to sleep on, but that he was just happy to be safe and dry with his family.

Every building damaged, no lives lost

Maureen Gordon, 53, was waiting at Port Aransas city offices to get to a shelter after her roof caved in and she fell on broken glass from her windows.

""I could never go through something like this again,"" said Gordon, who has pieced together a living waiting tables and tending bar for the past 20 years in this resort town where shrimpers live

alongside wealthy second-home owners and surfers.

City Manager Ken Parsons said there were no fatalities in this town of about 3,800, which can swell to 70,000 on weekends. The past two days have been spent doing searches and rescues using dogs. No major injuries have been reported.

""Every building was compromised in some way, whether it was 3 percent or 100 percent,"" Parsons said.

The city marina was destroyed and expensive yachts as well as small boats were sunk. Many boats washed up along the Main Street.

Now the city is working to plug numerous gas leaks and repair downed wires. Homeowners will be let back in during the next several days, but the 80 percent of residents who are second-home owners or renters will have to wait longer, he said.

Frank McDonald, 64, a surfer and disabled veteran who moved to Texas from La Jolla, Calif., took shelter in a city building with his two labs after his home was destroyed.

""I don't know how I will survive this,"" he said. ""I even lost my surfboard in the storm.""

Airport deluged

Southwest Airlines flight attendant Allison Brown estimates that at least 50 flight attendants, a number of pilots, airport staff members and hundreds of passengers have been stranded at William P. Hobby Airport since at least 1 a.m. Sunday.

Brown said that the airport flooded so quickly that shuttles were unable to get to them, and that area hotels -- which also were flooded -- were unable to accommodate them. Police told them it would be unsafe to try to leave.

""Luckily, we have the restaurant staff or else we would've been stuck with no food,"" Brown said. ""Waters in the road are around four feet -- minimum -- surrounding the airport.""

'Everyone's mad at that stupid guy Harvey'

In the town of Katy, police Lt. Howard Briner was posted at the HEB, a major grocery store.

""If you have to leave, please drive slowly because cars can flood a house when they drive up too fast,"" he said. ""We all need to respect each other and think about others right now.""

Inside the cavernous supermarket, Michele and Joel Antonini were in line with 20 sacks of groceries doing just that -- thinking of neighbors they probably would be taking in from Grand Lakes, where they used to live.

Michele Antonini buys groceries for neighbors. (Emily Wax/The Washington Post)

Grand Lakes is already experiencing flooding because the bayous run through the neighborhood, and when they flood, often the reservoirs flood as well.

They bought a sheet cake, a roast, chips, hot dogs and hamburgers.

""We just want to be ready if they are hungry and can get out,"" Michele said. ""We just want to be ready to help.""

Amanda Picard, 35, a CrossFit trainer, said that she lives behind a creek, and that all her neighborhood lakes were flooded. She said she was making a grocery run in case the storm goes on for days.

""It's gonna be a long haul,"" said Amanda, who was shopping for spring mix and frozen pizza with her husband and 6-year-old.

Also, shelters are now being set up, including at the Fussell senior citizen center.

""Turn around, and don't drive,"" is what firefighter and paramedic Kyle Fritsche said, warning that if water goes halfway up a car's wheel, ""you will float.""

He brought a suitcase to work packed for what all departments are calling ""a marathon, not a sprint,"" and expected that the worst was still yet to come.

""Even after the rain, we have potential for some dangerous flooding for days,"" he said.

The fear is more than 40 feet of water.

""Normally, we could count on the rain sinking into the ground,"" he said. ""But we are already at the total saturation point.""

He and his fiancee missed their anniversary, ""everyone's mad at that stupid guy Harvey.""

When your kid gets sick during a hurricane

Erica Stietenroth, 38, said she was in tears driving to find a pharmacy that was open to help her 8-year-old daughter, who had a 105-degree fever.

The emergency room on Saturday night didn't have the drugs she needed for strep throat, so they wrote her a prescription. And a tornado was about to hit.

On Sunday morning, she started searching for open pharmacies. She found one inside a local grocery store, but the pharmacists weren't able to get to work. Finally, an employee came in to shop for food and was given permission to mix her medication.

Emma Stietenroth, 8, had to be rushed to the emergency room in Katy because of a high fever. The ER wrote her a prescription.

But on the way home, she got caught in a suspected tornado.

So her mother spent the next morning searching for a pharmacy that was open. (Emily Wax/The Washington Post)

""I was crying my eyes out for my baby girl,"" she said. ""By the grace of God, that employee was there.""

For a lighter side: Donna Clark, 43, drove to 10 Starbucks locations in the Katy area Sunday morning, navigating flooding to get her caffeine fix.

All were closed. She was participating in a Starbucks contest in which she had to buy coffee on weekends between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. to win free coffee for a year.

Today was the day she supposed to buy her final cup.

The teacher hugged her daughter in front of the closed Cinco Ranch Starbucks inside a Target store, which was open.

""Sadly, I'm acting like a child,"" she laughed gently.

Katrina flashback

In a neighborhood recreation center on the far south side of Dallas, Rebecca Hernandez sat near a door that held back the first heavy rain from the storm she and her family left Houston to avoid. Hernandez, 35, didn't want to wait around for floodwater to reach the front door of her home in North Houston as it did during Hurricane Katrina. So she, her husband, Gilbert, and their three children drove to Dallas on Friday night. With rent due in a few days, the family couldn't afford to spend more than one night in a hotel, so they came here.

""We try to make this place as much like home as possible, said Angienetta Johnson, the phone-wielding leader of this rec center-turned-emergency shelter.

For some, that means making computers available for children who want to play video games. For Hernandez's 2-year-old son, Gilbert Constantine, maybe some time watching ""Kung-Fu Panda,"" she said.

Normally a four-hour drive, the trek from Dallas to Houston took five for the Hernandez family. Now, it could take as many as eight, some here at the rec center say. Regardless, Johnson is ready. With degrees in engineering, mathematics and information systems -- and 41 years developing spacecraft at NASA -- there may be no better person to run this shelter.

""We're starting small,"" Johnson said, noting that perhaps 500 or so evacuees are in her shelter and one across town. ""But we have plans to go up to 5,000, if need be.""

Hernandez and her family are among those who can count on the generosity of the volunteers such as Johnson, and despite the nonstop rain pounding on the glass, found humor in one situation.

Her father-in-law, who is in his mid-70s, called to say he was ""fishing from inside the house,"" in Dickinson, near Galveston.

Eventually, the Coast Guard rescued him from the roof of his home.

""We just laughed. He's crazy,"" she said.

A neighbor has told Hernandez that Harvey's waters are at the family's front door now -- just as they were with Katrina. But Harvey isn't done yet, with at least a dozen more inches expected to fall in Houston and elsewhere.

""We're ready to go back as soon as they tell us it's safe,"" she said.

Crossing the pond

Richard Whelan rested on his dark green umbrella, his month-old daughter, Marnie, strapped to his chest. His wife, Amy Whelan, wiped the water drops from her eyeglasses, a gesture she'd soon have to repeat.

In the five years they have lived in Houston, the Whelans have seen it flood three times, but never like this, never as bad.

They lived in an apartment complex a block off Buffalo Bayou and had walked toward Allen Parkway, a road that lines the Bayou to see the water that was flooding homes, parking garages and KHOU, the local news station.

Amy tucked her phone in her black raincoat. She was taking photos to send to family members in England. Richard is originally from London and Amy from Manchester.

Marnie was supposed to make her first trip across the pond with her mother on Saturday. When the Whelans saw the forecast, they tried to switch their flight out of George Bush Intercontinental Airport to Saturday night, but flights were canceled.

""We were supposed to be on a flight tonight, but there's no chance,"" she said.

She peers at her husband with a smile. He's Mr. Safety. He has been watching the news and wondering why all of these people are trying to drive through high water.

""There's a guy out there kayaking through it, which is kind of fun but again, I'm like, 'What are you doing? Why are you kayaking?"" Richard said.

He had been up since 7 a.m. helping residents at the apartment next door. He pushed a blue car up an incline out of an underground parking garage, where the water rose above the floodgates.

A different sort of cruise

Passengers aboard the Carnival Freedom cruise ship are getting an extended vacation because of Harvey.

Instead of docking in Galveston on Saturday as scheduled, the ship stopped in New Orleans to take on fresh water and stock up on provisions.

""We are now on our way back to Galveston, but the Port of Galveston is still closed,"" said Randy Turrentine, one of the ship's passengers. ""They say we may be out here until Tuesday morning.""

Turrentine says even if the ship manages to dock in Galveston, he and his family may still be unable to return to their home in Spring because of the ongoing flooding.

'We are lucky'

In Houston neighborhoods where water stayed in the streets and out of homes, residents turned out to marvel.

Susan Dickson, 71, rattled off the floods she'd seen in Houston since she moved here in 1968: Allison, Ike, Alicia.

""This is the worst because it's not stopping,"" she said. ""I've not seen it go on and on like this before.""

Other neighbors agreed that in past storms, the streets filled and drained within hours. Not so this time.

""I'm wasting my time trying to unclog the intakes,"" said Klaus Thoma, a 72-year-old lawyer, as he scraped as storm drain covers with a plastic rake, trying to speed the water along. But he feared it had nowhere to go. Waterways across the city, a publicly maintained drainage system, were all full as well.

""We are lucky,"" he said standing in ankle-deep water. ""Just think about the people getting rescued, who lost their homes. It's horrible.""

231,231,"In 2013, the United States ceded the supercomputing crown to China, whose Sunway TaihuLight machine is over five times as powerful as the U.S. government's fastest system, called Titan. But the Department of Energy is working on a new generation of supercomputers that are 50 times faster than Titan -- a performance boost described as ""exascale."" Today, DoE awarded $258 million in contracts to six U.S. companies -- AMD, Cray (maker of Titan), Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Intel, and Nvidia -- to build an exascale system by 2021. The companies themselves are expected to add at least $172 million of their own funding to the project, since they will also benefit from the new technologies developed.

Technological contributions to the Exascale Computing Project will vary. In the first phase, companies will be designing technologies that could potentially be used in a future system, says Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). It will be pushing a new computer architecture that keeps data in monstrous amounts of superfast RAM where it can be worked on all at once, rather than shuttling it to and from slower hard drives. This pool of data will be a ""fabric"" linking processors that work on the data. HPE introduced a prototype of this technology, called The Machine last month.

That memory-oriented approach seems to jibe with IBM's philosophy. ""High performance computing is shifting from a purely compute-centric model to one that is much more data-centric,"" writes James Sexton of IBM Research in an email to Fast Company. ""The ability to manage, train, sort and analyze the data 'where it resides' and 'as it flows' through the system is critical to gaining insight quickly from the plethora of data sources vs. traditional [computing methods].""

Nvidia's contribution will be more-powerful graphics processing units for artificial intelligence -- a generation or more beyond the new Volta chips going into DoE computers already slated for 2018. Beyond the hardware, DoE is also charging the companies to write powerful software to run the monstrous calculations.

You'd be forgiven for not grasping what the performance goal of 1,000 petaflop/s (quadrillions of calculations per second) means for real-world applications. DoE lists plenty of potential examples, such as simulating the effects of earthquakes, predicting the effectiveness of cancer treatments, designing nuclear fusion reactors, and modeling the aerodynamics of giant wind farms. An April 2017 DoE presentation on phenomena that the system can model even includes the words ""climate change"" -- once in a 30-page document.

One of the Exascale Computing Project's green goals is to boost performance without requiring more energy. But even if DoE succeeds, it will still have a pretty high electric bill. The best-case scenario is a system that consumes 20 megawatts, enough to power about 20,000 homes."
232,232,"He's been ridiculed for spending $1B+ on public health initiatives, but points out the life expectancy of New Yorkers increased by three years while he was mayor.

The name Bloomberg is a worldwide brand that could refer to a number of things...a cable channel, a radio network, a news service, a magazine, or a 75-year-old former mayor of New York who founded the Bloomberg Financial media empire and flirted with running for president. According to Forbes Magazine, Michael Bloomberg is the 10th richest man in the world, and one of a growing number of extremely wealthy people who plan to give most of their money away...releasing a torrent of private philanthropy that is already having an impact on the country.

Of that group, Michael Bloomberg is one of the most interesting and straight forward, and this past spring he agreed to talk to us about how he came to accumulate $47 billion dollars...and what he hopes to accomplish by giving it away.

Michael Bloomberg: Oh, it's more money than anybody could possibly spend on themselves. The issue is what can ya do with it? You can't take it with ya, although I have a cartoon at home of a guy on his death bed in a hospital with the rails around and his family looking down like vultures. And he looks up and he says, ""I know I can't take it with me, but I can take the access code.""

At 75, ""Mike"" Bloomberg, as he likes to be called, is a long way from retirement. Most days you'll find him in the gleaming Oz-like tower that bears his company's name....a high-energy, egalitarian work place, at the crossroads of media, information technology and capitalism.

Steve Kroft: This is an incredible building, office building. It looks like, I don't know what it looks like.

Michael Bloomberg: What I'm trying to do is to create excitement. So people say, ""My goodness, what's going on here? There's something different about this company."" The employees, you want them to get psyched. And it's a chance to meet each other. My job is to get people to work together.

With free food and no offices, even for Bloomberg, this might be considered one of the world's great corporate headquarters...if it weren't for the fact that Bloomberg L.P. is not a corporation, it's a limited partnership, a private company....and 85 percent of all of this and a lot more belongs to Mike Bloomberg.

Steve Kroft: Is this is a technology company? Is it an information company?

Michael Bloomberg: Yes and yes. We try to get information people need, store it, present it, and let you use it.

When Bloomberg started out as clerk on the Wall Street trading desk of Salomon Brothers in 1966 he thought there must be a better way to get up to the minute financial data than combing through the Wall Street Journal. He spent 15 years trying to convince his partners at Salomon that computers could be the answer. When they fired him in 1981, he used his $10 million severance to hire three young engineers and launch his startup.

Michael Bloomberg: When I started the company, it was before PCs were invented. I know you don't think there was a day. We literally built our own. And the Internet hadn't been invented. So we created our own. We'd rent a telephone line and then had a little device that let you branch out when you got to Chicago or wherever.

Ever since then Mike Bloomberg has pretty much done things the way he wants to.

Michael Bloomberg: Where else have you seen a curved escalator? We needed a curved one. It fit into the space, and the architect said, ""Doesn't exist."" And I said, ""You go to Japan, you'll find a curved one."" And they did of course.

Bloomberg has a degree in electrical engineering from Johns Hopkins University, and it is that discipline of an engineer that defines his character and personality: detached, analytical, pragmatic.

Steve Kroft: These are some of the words that people have used to describe you. Tell me...

Michael Bloomberg: Depends whether it's good or bad.

Steve Kroft: Blunt.

Michael Bloomberg: I tend to be reasonably blunt, maybe a little bit too much. But I just-- I always respected people that tell the truth. And I've always wanted people to tell me the truth.

Steve Kroft: Self-confident.

Michael Bloomberg: Reasonably self-confident. Been successful. Don't think that-- I'm -- I'd-- I'm infallible. Will always make mistakes.

Steve Kroft: Arrogant. You've certainly heard people say that.

Michael Bloomberg: Um, I suppose I come across that way sometimes. But my mother would have told me, ""Don't.""

Even his late mother would probably forgive him for the occasional lapse of humility given the size and the scope of the Bloomberg empire. Nearly 20,000 employees in 192 locations around the world, gathering, writing, transmitting, and analyzing information that will move markets.

Michael Bloomberg: These people are doing one-minute radio business updates for a hundred different radio stations around the country.

But the real money and most of the profits come from a mysterious piece of equipment known as the Bloomberg Terminal that sits on the desks of titans and traders all over the world.

Michael Bloomberg: Sound, pictures, graphics, tabular data. Different ways to look at the markets.

It's really a customized keyboard and closely guarded proprietary software, linked to a private computer network, that provides a volume of data that's unavailable anywhere else. Live streams from 300 stock exchanges, curated tweets, the exact location of oil tankers around the world. The kind of stuff 325,000 professionals pay $25,000 to rent for one year. If you do the math it adds up to about $8 billion.

Michael Bloomberg: But let's say you want to look at a stock, General Motors, for example.

After using his fingerprint to log onto his account, Bloomberg gave us a peek behind the curtain.

Michael Bloomberg: On the left are all of the companies that sell parts and to General Motors. And on the right are all of the companies that buy General Motors output. Generally cars. The different indices that General Motors stock is in. Here are the other companies that compete with them. Here are the big holders of their stock, analysts that follow it, who's on the board, who works in the company.

Steve Kroft: Why has nobody else done this?

Michael Bloomberg: For an individual company to do it, it's probably too expensive, unless it's your business. This is our business.

Bloomberg has not only left his mark on Wall Street. He has left it on New York City. He took us up in a company helicopter he was piloting to have a look.

Michael Bloomberg: LaGuardia, helicopter number six Mike Victor.

The thing he likes best about flying, he said, is if you don't follow the rules you die.

By 2001, Bloomberg was already worth $five billion and looking for a new challenge...he wanted to run something big like the UN or the World Bank. He settled on New York City, taking leave from his job and spending a quarter of a billion dollars of his own money to get himself elected mayor three times.

Michael Bloomberg: Here is the new World Trade Center. You can see the big tall building and others.

Steve Kroft: Right.

The first time he was elected was just two months after 9/11...he managed the resurrection from the rubble.

Michael Bloomberg: Right through there you can see the Oculus, which is this big shopping thing. This whole part of Manhattan before was sort of desolate after 9/11, we now have 25 hotels. Now it's a bustling residential community as well.

He saw the city through the economic crisis of 2008...and while he was mayor development and construction boomed and the crime rate dropped.

Michael Bloomberg: Hudson Yards, which is this big development. Phenomenally successful development. Created an enormous amount of jobs, enormous amount of new office space.

He was sometimes ridiculed for his public health war on smoking, trans fats and soft drinks...but he points out life expectancy of New Yorkers increased by three years while he was in office.

Steve Kroft: Did you enjoy your time as mayor?

Michael Bloomberg: Loved every minute of it. It's a wonderful job. The challenges are enormous, but you have a great opportunity to make a difference.

He was successful enough in the job to twice consider running for president, but he was never able to find a solid constituency in either party. Last year, he thought about running as an Independent and was prepared to spend a billion dollars of his fortune to get elected, aides say. He'd even decided on Retired Admiral Mike Mullen as a running mate.

Steve Kroft: And you came close. You looked at it. But you didn't pull the trigger.

Michael Bloomberg: If I thought we could win, or had a reasonable chance, I would have done it. It would be totally unlikely, very unlikely that an Independent could win. And in my case, I was mayor for a long time. People know where I stand. I couldn't pretend to be something I'm not. For the Republicans, I'm pro-choice, pro-gay rights, pro-immigration. That's a good start there. You'll never get their nomination. On the Democratic side, I believe in teacher evaluation. The big banks, we need to help them rather than just keep trying to tear them down. Those are not particularly things that will help you get the nomination.

He campaigned hard against Donald Trump, his New York rival in the general election, calling him a con man at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia.

Michael Bloomberg: I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one!

Steve Kroft: Have you spoken to Trump since he's in the White House?

Michael Bloomberg: Yes, once I called him and congratulated him. We joked about my speech in Philadelphia. And before he finished the conversation, he gave me his personal phone number, his cell phone. I haven't called him, so I don't know if-- whether he'd answer it now. But-- he's-- I hope he does a good job.

Steve Kroft: You're not gonna run for office again?

Michael Bloomberg: Well, I'm 75 years old. It'd be an age issue, I suppose. I've got plenty of things to do. And maybe I'll run for president of my block association, but not much more than that.

Bloomberg remains incredibly influential and was received as a world leader when he traveled abroad for meetings on climate change. He is still trying to make a difference and using his incredible wealth to do it.

Almost all of his fortune will end up with his charitable foundation. He's already given away more than $5 billion to causes that often dovetail with his political interests.

Steve Kroft: There is now a fairly crowded field out there of people who are incredibly wealthy that are giving money to advance their own political agendas.

Michael Bloomberg: Well, if they-- if the projects --

Steve Kroft: The Koch brothers, for one. Or George Soros.

Michael Bloomberg: I know George Soros and I know the Koch brothers. And, while I don't agree with any of those three on a lotta things, I think it's fair to say, 'cause I know them reasonably well, they really believe and they really are trying to do something. They really want to change the world. You, for example, in the Northeast couldn't get treated for cancer at any major university or hospital without being in a Koch cancer building. They've given an enormous amount of money. And if you get cancer, you should start saying thank you to the Kochs.

To some it's just another example of the super wealthy having a disproportionate influence on political debate and public opinion. Bloomberg has spent a billion dollars trying to get people to quit smoking, $135 million to battle the NRA on gun control, and a $100 million to assist the Sierra Club and its lawyers in shutting down more than 250 coal fired plants.

Steve Kroft: You're not out of the political arena altogether. You're, you're very active in a number of issues, coal and the environment being one of them right now--

Michael Bloomberg: Yeah. Coal is a very dirty fuel. It's been killing people. Around the world, people are saying, ""No more coal.""

In new a book with Carl Pope...Bloomberg writes, ""I don't have much sympathy for industries whose products leave behind a trail of diseased and dead bodies."" He's more sympathetic to the miners.

Michael Bloomberg: Coalminers have lost their jobs. It's very tragic, and we have to do something about it. Technology's come in. Technology has replaced most of these coalminers. They didn't lose their jobs for any reason other than it was automated. And now we have a bunch of people who have becau-- no fault of their own, they've lost their job. Those jobs don't exist anymore. Somebody said-- to promise that coal jobs are coming back is like promising the workers who used to work at Eastman Kodak that film is gonna come back. Not likely to happen.

Steve Kroft: There are people out there would say, ""Look, is it Mike Bloomberg's job to give the Sierra Club $100 million to go out and try and--""

Michael Bloomberg: Well, keep in mind, Mike Bloomberg's kids and grandkids are breathing that air just like the coalminers' families are breathing that air. And the coalminers are the ones that have the conflict. They want their jobs, I understand that. They need to be able to feed their families. They also have to worry about their health and the health of their families.

Steve Kroft: Are you giving money to try and find these coal-- to try and reeducate and give them new skills?

Michael Bloomberg: We're certainly working on trying to find ways to create jobs, not just for them. But technology, which is what cost the coalminers their jobs, not the Sierra Club incidentally. Long before the Sierra Club started this, coalmining jobs went from 250,000 in the country to 70,000 in the country.

Bloomberg sees personal philanthropy in the tradition of Carnegie, the Rockefellers and the Mellons... not as a threat to democracy, but as a way to do important things that are not politically feasible. And as always, Mike Bloomberg trusts his judgment.

Steve Kroft: Is there anything you want that you don't have?

Michael Bloomberg: I like what I see when I look in the mirror. If I get sentimental, I look and say, ""Uh. It's a bad day. They beat up on me,"" this, that, and the other thing. But ya know? We've spent one billion trying to convince people to not smoke. It's been phenomenally successful. We've probably saved millions of lives. There aren't many people that have done that. So, you know, when I get to heaven, I'm not sure I'm gonna stand for an interview. I'm going right in."
233,233,"ST. GEORGE - Though the Intermountain Cancer Center being built next door to Dixie Regional Medical Center is a year away from completion, the cutting-edge research slated to take place within its walls is already well underway at the Intermountain Precision Genomics laboratory just down the road.

Located in the upper floors of the Rim Rock Plaza on Medical Center Drive in St. George, medical oncologists and researchers work to unlock ways to find the best options to treat cancers through precision medicine - a fancy term for customized, personalized treatment tailored to an individual patient's needs.

Precision genomics takes the concept of personalized care a little further.

""Precision genomics means selecting personalized or individualized treatments for a patient based on their unique molecular- or DNA-makeup,"" laboratory Executive Director Dr. Lincoln Nadauld said.

Genomics is a study of DNA that focuses on finding out what changes to DNA, or mutations, have taken place to generate a disease, he said. Once those mutated genes are identified, specific medications can be recommended to help treat a specific patient's cancer through the use of immunotherapy and other treatments.

""(Immunotherapy) is a strategy to help your immune system find your cancer and kill your cancer cells,"" laboratory Director of Immuno-oncology Dr. Terence Rhodes said.

Cancerous cells that would otherwise remain unnoticed by the immune system are revealed through the use of drugs, a process that typically takes nine to 12 weeks to see if a drug applied is working, Rhodes said. However, paired with precision genomics, oncologists are able to see if a patient's cancer is susceptible to certain immunotherapy treatments before any drugs are used.

""Together, through those two strategies, we may be able to help our patients live longer and healthier lives,"" Rhodes said.

While some patients may be able to forego chemotherapy in favor of immunotherapy, Nadauld said, a patient may still be found to benefit from a mix of treatments that includes chemotherapy and radiation.

From research to application

Both Nadauld and Rhodes are medical scientists in addition to being oncologists. As such, they take part in the research being done at Intermountain's laboratory. A large part of what its precision genomics program hopes to achieve is to take discoveries made in the lab and apply them to patient care.

""We've developed a process that can help patients directly,"" Nadauld said.

Physicians can order a genetic test of a tumor sample offered to Precision Genomics for examination by a board of specialists brought together by Intermountain Healthcare with Precision Genomics.

The board, which includes Nadauld and Rhodes, analyzes the genetic data taken from the tumor sample and then makes specific recommendations based on those findings. The general turnaround from the lab receiving the sample to a treatment recommendation is about 16 days.

Patients who typically benefit from this testing are those with late-stage cancers who have ""run out of options,"" Nadauld said. For them, their cancers may have become resistant to drugs that had previously worked, so a new treatment needs to be found.

Nadauld shared an example of a man in his 40s with late-stage colon cancer.

""Unfortunately, his cancer became resistant to various chemotherapies,"" Nadauld said. ""It was continuing to grow despite our treatments and there wasn't much time left.""

DNA testing was done and it was discovered the cancer was susceptible to drugs generally used for breast cancer. Once those drugs were applied, the patient's quality of life greatly improved.

""It worked. It worked great. His tumors all started shrinking,"" Nadauld said with enthusiasm. He felt so much better .... We found him a treatment that gave him more time, more quality time.""

The man improved to the point he was able to return to work and also experience family milestones like seeing his children graduate from high school. His cancer did later become resistant to the new treatment and he died, but not before his life was improved through precision genomics treatment.

That man's case is just one of many the board examines, some involving people in the St. George area, others from across the United States.

""We're receiving and analyzing dozens of tests every week, from all over the county,"" Nadauld said.

Translating the genome

When examining tumor DNA, oncologists typically focus on 162 genes known to be associated with cancer pathway mutations. They tend to ignore the approximate 20,000 genes that make up the human genome.

However, that overall makeup is being sequenced and analyzed by the Translational Science Center at Precision Genomics in order to provide a bigger picture that oncologists and researchers will be able to draw from for their purposes.

Helaman Escobar, director of Translational Science and Research, said the center's personnel look for overall patterns in the genome beyond the 162 known genes that may contribute to cancer.

""We're trying to find out what mutations are meaningful so future doctors can use that to make medical decisions,"" Escobar said, adding that the subsequent research will aid doctors in figuring out why cancers behave certain ways or are susceptible to certain drugs while being resistant to others.

Part of what the center is doing is sequencing genetic information from over 4 million tumor samples from patients stored by Intermountain Healthcare over the last 40 years. Called the ""biorepository,"" the samples are kept in a basement facility in Salt Lake City.

The large population of samples in the biorepository provides doctors and medical scientists the wherewithal to work and draw comparisons to current cases. Further unlocking the genetic profiles of particular tumors from years past can also help doctors see what treatment may or may not have proven effective in combating the disease at the time.

The biorepository helps build a foundation on which the precision genomics program can move forward, with Escobar and others working to unlock genetic information along the way.

""We are bringing state-of-the-art technology to St. George, it's really exciting,"" Escobar said. ""We'll have the ability to sequence thousands of genomes a year, and that's a big feature. Genomes require a lot of sequencing, a lot of lab work to be able to generate that much data.""

Stanford partnership

An aspect of the Intermountain Precision Genomics program that is often highlighted by Intermountain officials is its partnership with Stanford University. The partnership has produced a satellite laboratory of the Stanford Genome Technology Center, currently housed at the Rim Rock Plaza.

Collaborative work is being done on producing technology and tools related to genetic sequencing, including a program called ""informatics.""

Informatics will better enable computers to read genetic data compiled from sequencing, Escobar said.

""Imagine sequencing a genome like generating a book with thousands of pages of letters you cannot read. So the 'informatics,' that comes after the lab as to deciphering what is actually written in the book,"" Escobar said. ""And because we're deciphering genomes, we want to look at what words in that book have been misspelled - those are the mutations.""

The Stanford partnership helps put Intermountain Healthcare on the cutting edge of research and technology, Rhodes said, adding it will greatly aid in taking research to the next step of clinical application.

""Stanford innovates and we integrate,"" Rhodes said. ""We're able to take all their smarts and technology and discoveries and apply them to patient care.""

Intermountain Healthcare is also a part of the Oncology Precision Network, or OPeN, a collaboration with Stanford Cancer Institute, Providence Health & Services and Syapse. According to the network's website, the group ""aims to find breakthroughs in cancer care by leveraging previously untapped real-world cancer genomics data.""

Providing hope to those to who have ""run out of options""

Nadauld, Rhodes and Escobar each said they were excited to be a part of the precision genomics program and take part in the research as well as the ultimate goal of applying the research and discoveries wrought from it to patient care.

For the time being, precision genomics is primarily used to find treatments for late-stage cancer patients who have run out of options, Nadauld said. Like the man with colon cancer he mentioned, they may become resistant to a standard from of treatment and need something new in order to improve their quality of life.

""I think patients want to feel hope and that they are not alone and that they have help in their battle,"" Nadauld said. ""... We feel like what we have built in this lab - the capabilities that we have, the teams that we've built - is offering hope to patients that they wouldn't have otherwise. We're offering hope to patients in a tangible way.""

As for early-stage cancers, Nadauld said, medical science is very good about treating and even curing those conditions through surgery, medications and other means. New treatment options are also being approved by the Food and Drug Administration every day, he said.

Finding treatment options for other maladies is another benefit of precision genomics moving forward. While its current focus largely deals with cancer, Intermountain Precision Genomics Operations Officer Gary Stone said research and discoveries made through the genomics lab will ultimately help physicians make applications to other conditions as well.

""We're building a facility here that will be on part with the top bio-tech locations in the world,"" Escobar said, ""so it's pretty unique.""

234,234,"ST. GEORGE - Though the Intermountain Cancer Center being built next door to Dixie Regional Medical Center is a year away from completion, the cutting-edge research slated to take place within its walls is already well underway at the Intermountain Precision Genomics laboratory just down the road.

Located in the upper floors of the Rim Rock Plaza on Medical Center Drive in St. George, medical oncologists and researchers work to unlock ways to find the best options to treat cancers through precision medicine - a fancy term for customized, personalized treatment tailored to an individual patient's needs.

235,235,"You might view the smartphone you're (probably) using to read this article a little differently after watching Death by Design, the latest documentary by the American filmmaker Sue Williams.

The film puts the life of electronic devices under the microscope, exposing the drastic environmental and health costs that are chalked up in the manufacturing process despite the end-products' relatively short lifespans.

""I could have made it (the film) about plastic bottles or blue jeans, but I wanted to take something that everybody feels really attached to."" Williams tells Asia Times. ""I think it's a powerful way to make people think about how they consume.""

Documentaries about the environment and technology are not new. But Williams' 73-minute production takes things up a notch, tying up multi-faceted concerns with its focus on indispensable gadgets in our modern lives such as smartphones and computers.

The project started off as a profile of Ma Jun, a Chinese environmentalist and one of the main characters in the film. He has done groundbreaking work on electronics companies' environmental violations in China.

""I actually never even thought about [electronics being unclean],"" says Williams, who after some research and trips to Silicon Valley and China realized the subject lent itself to much more than a story about one person or community. ""It became very clear that as I learnt more about it that [Ma] is one valuable part of a very big global problem.""

Referring to the industrial transfer from the US to China that began in the late 1970s and 80s, William says: ""It's very important to know what the industry knew before they went to China.""

The film first takes us inside US factories back in the 1980s. A former IBM employee who worked on a US semiconductor production line at the time, while pregnant, later gave birth to a brain-damaged son. She had not been informed about the toxicity of the materials with which she worked every day.

Workers were provided with protective clothing, but ""that was to protect the products, not the people"", says the woman in the film.

The film uncovers an internal IBM database that shows extremely high incidence of cancer among retirees.

From there, Williams' lens shifts to the Taiwanese manufacturer, and Apple's biggest supplier, Foxconn, whose workers have also suffered health problems.

In 2010, more than a dozen Foxconn workers, mostly in their early 20s or younger, chose to end their own lives in desperation. Hundreds of thousands of its workers still work more than 80 hours a week, enduring enormous strain and boredom, and astonishingly low pay.

Best known for her proclaimed trilogy about China for PBS, Williams started Ambrica Productions in 1986, with an objective of looking at issues ""with an international scope and interest."" Such a focus, along with her knowledge of both Chinese and American history, is fundamental to this film, as she traces how the industry evolved and traveled across borders.

The tech industry also brought to China, and other developing countries, the problem of electronic waste pollution. The film reveals that when tech companies found out that chemical waste from their products had started contaminating the soil and water around Silicon Valley, they began to look for new dumping grounds to get around their legal and environmental obligations.

""The industry was clear about what they were doing when they moved to China,"" says Williams. ""I was struck by the fact that the industry really took off after moving to China.""

The film suggests, however, that this ""exporting"" of the problem is an illusion at the end of the day. In an experiment where a team of University of California, San Diego researchers flew over the US to measure and trace chemicals in the clouds, they claimed to find solid evidence that ""exported"" toxic pollution eventually finds its way around the globe.

The point Williams forcefully makes is that environmental problems tend to come full circle.

The film had its international debut at last year's Seattle International Film Festival, a cinematic jubilee right at the heart of the city that is home to Microsoft, Amazon and countless other tech giants and start-ups. The director felt herself ""at the belly of the bees"" and worried about how the film would be received.

""We did a Q&A, and asked how many people worked in the electronics industry. Two-thirds of the audience put their hands up but they all responded like people did at other screenings - 'What can we do?' 'We had no idea.' 'How can we do better?' ""

Williams takes a short pause, her eyes widening. ""[They were] asking me what to do.""

She says: ""They haven't seen this, haven't been to Foxconn to see these factories,"" said Williams. ""They sit in their desks in Seattle with lattes and micro breweries and food delivery services and they just see the good that the tech industry has brought them.""

So, what can one do? Williams offers some ideas in the film.

One of these comes from the story of an Irish startup, IFixit, which sells repair parts and provides online repair guides. Founded by two young creative engineers, the company challenges excessive consumption by helping people to adopt the habit of fixing things as a way to regain autonomy over their products.

""They (the tech companies) give you this (a device) and say don't worry about it if you break it, get a new one,"" says Kyle Wiens, co-founder of IFixit, in the film. ""You don't really own it, in a way.""

""It's quite a sobering film, not easy to watch for some people. So I tried to be solution-oriented,"" says Williams. ""We will have to find other ways to make things and we have to do a better job. That's why I made the film.""

At a screening in Hong Kong, one businesswoman in the audience expressed her desire to take the film to mainland to initiate discussions with local governments about the issues raised.

""I so hope that happens,"" says Williams. ""I hope it goes viral in china. Because we really need to think about the ways we consume."""

Answer from C Stuart Hardwick, Award-Winning Scifi Author:

Why is there no race to land man on Mars like the race to the Moon? Largely because those in the position to fund such a race have seen the bill for the last one. During the 1960s the space program consumed 5% of the federal budget -- competing with the expensive cancer of war in southeast Asia.

Trending: Trump and Putin Are Leading New Nuclear Cold War Between West and Russia, Foreign Minister Says

It needn't have been so, but the race to beat the USSR gave the moonshot the character of a wartime weapons procurement program -- sufficient to do the job, but damn the expense. That was sort of the point. It gave the electorate new heroes something to rally around and helped transition America's post war industrial economy into a technological powerhouse.

It also taught us how hard space flight really is -- especially manned spaceflight -- and in our national exuberance, made it seen more expensive than it needed to be. We built the space flight equivalent of the SR-71 spy plane (mission capable, but expensive and custom made) where we needed a DC3 (mass produced but adaptable) and only knew how to build the Wright Flyer. Congress didn't quite appreciate how much we were biting off.

The program did what it was hoped it would. Even as a controversial war and deteriorating race relations pulled America apart, Apollo bound us together, not just with each other, but with everyone else on the planet. One could argue that this alone was worth the price of the program, but we did get a bit carried away.

NASA had designed Apollo to meet Kennedy's mandate, but they spent money on studies of follow on lunar bases, space stations, LEM-derived space freighters, and upgrades to Saturn that from an economic perspective, made as much sense as building a fleet of disposable battleships.

Meanwhile, the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office had developed and tested an atomic thermal rocket and was advocating to have it developed into an atomic third stage for the Saturn, to send man to Mars in the 1970s.

Don't miss: How Random Are Powerball Drawings?

Having seen the ballooning costs so far, Congress was horrified. We had already ""won"" as far as they were concerned, having gotten to the moon and back, and everything else (including science) was just dollars and danger.

This, I believe, left congress with a ""bad aftertaste"" that lasted well into the 1990s. Sure, they thought, NASA can do great things, but who can afford them? NASA negotiated a compromise. They traded their grandiose dreams for Skylab and the Shuttle, with the hopes that this would lead to and justify a later station, and from there...

In hindsight, it's hard to see how NASA planners, faced with dwindling interest and funding in the 1960s, thought anything they could achieve in low Earth orbit would restore the interest and the funding of their gravy days in the lead up to Apollo 11. In retrospect, they might have done better to set themselves a vision much more humble, but in its own way just as lofty, as the moonshot: developing economical space flight technology.

Alas, they were given what they asked for -- the shuttle -- morphed by committee into a sort of Swiss-Army Knife relaunchable space station that ultimately may have done as much to reinforce our national sense of sticker shock as to advance the final frontier.

So, when subsequent presidents have sought to challenge NASA with bold new missions... the funding has never materialized. Partly because of a lack of political commitment. Partly, though, it's because LBJ is gone.

Kennedy proposed the moon landing, and ultimately Kennedy is the one who initiated international cooperation in space, but more than anyone else alive, Lyndon B. Johnson championed the moon landings. According to NASA insiders, it was LBJ who, when Kennedy was fishing for a win in space, told Kennedy to send a memo officially asking him -- as vice president -- for ideas. It was in response that he (LBJ) suggested the moon landing. And after Kennedy consulted with the experts, it was LBJ who strong-armed congress into writing the checks. It was said of LBJ, ""Nobody wanted to say no to LBJ. He knew everyone on the hill, and he knew where all the bodies were buried.""

The Cold War was over, and we both won and lost. We won by using the power of capitalism to spend the hard line communists controlling the USSR under the table in history's greatest economic drinking competition. We lost by failing utterly to help Russian moderates -- who had known this was inevitable for decades -- to transition their country into a strong, stable, nation with the same incentives to innovation, but also the same controls against corruption and excess we had come by through hard knocks -- and now seem determined to dismantle. So instead of taking advantage of a historic opportunity to join strategic forces with a great global power, we trade cheap shots between a former reality TV star and a former KGB agent, each with his own nuclear arsenal. And we wonder why people dream of leaving the planet.

But I digress.

The moon landings were arguably the greatest thing ever done for the wrong reasons. We, as a nation, did it right, even carrying along rovers and a geologist. Sure, Congress wanted to put a thumb in the eye of the Kremlin, but America, from Kennedy down to the people, saw that for the first time since humans first walked out under that glowing thing in the sky, we could go there. So we did.

That was the good part. The moon landings not only inspired the generations who participated, but every generation since. They also paid dividends that are far less visible but far more important than the oft-touted spin-offs like CFL lighting and the acceleration of microcomputer research.

The Apollo program required ""rocket science"" of over 1,500 companies throughout the US economy, from the brassiere makers to foundries. The high-tolerance, high reliability engineering and manufacturing controls developed for and disseminated by the space program now inform all of manufacturing, from flat-pack furniture that goes together the first time and every time, to cars that don't rattle and drive 150,000 miles without a tuneup, to pocket computers 10,000 times more powerful than those that went to the moon.

The race was the bad part. It made everything far more expensive than it might have been. But maybe that's the way it had to be. Something else the space race did was illustrate with crystal clarity how, despite the creative capacity unleashed by free enterprise, despite the inefficiencies often inherent in centralized control, sometimes greatness requires both. At the moment, NASA seems to get that, and is embracing its role as a foil and champion of commercial innovators, even while working on the next great booster -- beyond the reach of commercial interests.

The last thing we need is another space race. Let's take our time. And this time, when we get there, when we press human feet against another world, let us stay.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has raised $27 million for Neuralink, a company he created last year to link human brains with computers.

Neuralink has sold $27 million worth of equity out of a total offering of $100 million, according to a document published by the SEC on Friday. The form lists 12 unnamed investors and says that equity was first sold on August 15, 2017.

Despite the filed paperwork, Musk tweeted on Friday that ""Neuralink is not seeking investors,"" which suggests that he may be significantly contributing to the funding himself or has already locked in others backers. The paperwork lists Jared Birchall as Neuralink's president.

Representatives for Musk and Neuralink didn't respond to requests for comment.

Musk started Neuralink last summer to link the human brain with computers by creating micron-sized devices to be surgically implanted into the brain. The startup is aiming to bring to market a product that helps with certain severe brain injuries due to stroke and cancer lesion in about four years.

Musk has described the need to create a ""neural lace"" device that's capable of supercharging the human brain. He has said that such a device would help humans combat the existential threat of artificially intelligent super-computers. Such a device would also allow humans to engage in ""consensual telepathy.""

Neuralink's website currently lists 8 job openings, including a chip designer, mechanical engineer, and a few software engineers.

Neuralink is Musk's fourth company. He is also the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and OpenAI, a non-profit AI research company. He also leads a tunneling startup called The Boring Company, which started as an offshoot of SpaceX.

The trust is responsible for the care of more than 650,000 people living in North and South Lanarkshire in Scotland, running three general hospitals and numerous GP surgeries, dentists, pharmacists and other services.

As of Saturday morning, the trust described the entire IT system as ""down"" and put out an emergency phone number for staff to use over the bank holiday weekend.

Dr Jane Burns, medical director for NHS Lanarkshire's acute division, asked patients not to attend hospitals ""unless it is essential"".

""If you do turn up at A&E and do not require emergency care you may be sent away from the department or you may experience a lengthy wait,"" she added.

""Emergency care will still be provided for those who do require to be seen.""

The health board's estate includes Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride, Monklands Hospital in Airdrie and Wishaw General Hospital.

Staff unable to use email systems or access appointments have been directing the public to the NHS Lanarkshire Facebook page for further information

The cyber attack appears to be more isolated than the global WannaCry attack in May, which hit NHS trusts across the UK and sparked urgent reviews of outdated systems, protections and staff training after equipment was disabled, patients turned away and ambulances diverted.

WannaCry, which affected more than 150 countries, spread through outdated Microsoft Windows software and caused automated messages appear on thousands of computers telling users their data had been encrypted and would be released in exchange for a Bitcoin payment.

Cyber attack hit 200,000 victims across 150 countries, says Europol chief

The unprecedented cyber attack is not believed to have directly targeted the NHS, but Britain's health service has previously been hit by viruses and The Independent revealed that Isis-linked hackers compromised some NHS websites last year.

Ben Gummer, the former cabinet office minister who lost his seat in May, warned at the time that ""large quantities of sensitive data"" held by the NHS was a target.

""No longer the stuff of spy thrillers and action movies, cyber attacks are a reality and they are happening now,"" he said in October.

""Our adversaries are varied: organised criminal groups, 'hactivists', untrained teenagers and foreign states.

""Attacks can cause economic damage, erode public trust in online services and by enabling fraud do real harm to individuals, their property and their privacy.""

Analysts have sounded intensifying warnings over the threat posed by cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure, like public health, electricity, water supplies, telecommunications, banking and transport.

Irish energy networks were targeted by hackers in a ""spear phishing"" attack last month, while the Houses of Parliament in Westminster and Scottish Parliament have also been hit.

A recent report by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) warned of the growing threat of cyber attacks and threats to the West's use of satellites in space.

Enemies could take out military and civilian communications and navigation systems, the report said, or target the UK's economy and crucial IT infrastructure causing chaos and panic, it said.

""In any major future conflict, an important part of the battle will be threats to the UK's critical national infrastructure from hostile cyber operations,"" RUSI's report concluded.

""The cyber threat spectrum is not only relevant to defence but to government as a whole, especially to critical national infrastructure and the broader economy.""

239,239,"Today, the Telegraph begins a three-part series reporting from Toronto's booming Artificial Intelligence sector where new technologies are being pioneered that will permanently change all of our lives

Deep within the inner sanctum of Google's downtown HQ in Toronto, past the rooftop crazy golf putting greens, foosball tables and ergonomic furniture sporting the bold primary colours of the company logo - stands a scruffy figure so incongruous, he might have been drawn by Quentin Blake.

In person, Professor Geoffrey Hinton bears all the hallmarks of the quintessential British academic: tousled hair; crumpled shirt with a barrage of biros in the top pocket and flanked by a vast, mucky whiteboard scrawled with impregnable equations. There are no chairs in his office. The 69-year-old prefers always to stand.

How robots are being taught to learn like toddlers 01:42

Gleefully eccentric he may be, but to the bright young things outside his office, Hinton is akin to a deity: the so-called ""Godfather of Artificial Intelligence (AI)"" and the brilliant mind behind the technology that has sparked a global revolution.

In this, his first British newspaper interview, Professor Hinton admits to being bemused by the nickname that has accompanied his late career surge.

His former students have now been poached by Silicon Valley to lead AI research at the likes of Apple, Facebook and Google (which has also appointed him a vice president engineering fellow). In the coming months, he will take the helm of Toronto's new $180m Vector Institute, which it is hoped will cement the city's status as a world leader in AI.

""I feel slightly embarrassed by being called the godfather,"" he says in a cut-glass English accent that has resisted all North American overtures.

What bought Geoffrey Hinton from years of relative academic obscurity to leading the cutting edge of AI is an unshakeable faith in his work. ""I have a Reagan-like ability to believe in my own data,"" he grins.

Hinton is a pioneer of something called machine learning which enables computers to come up with programmes to solve problems themselves. In particular, he has devised a subset of machine learning called ""deep learning"" whereby neural networks modelled on those that form the human brain enable machines to learn in the same way a toddler does.

This means computers can autonomously build layers of intelligence. Such systems have been supercharged in recent years by the advent of hugely powerful processing technology and are now becoming mainstream: powering everything from speech recognition patterns in our smart phones to image detection software and Amazon telling you which book to buy next.

Through the work of Hinton and his colleagues - dubbed by their rivals the ""Canadian Mafia"" - the potential of machine learning has become limitless. The Brave New World of AI is upon us and already permanently changing our lives; for good and ill.

Hinton was born in Wimbledon in post war Britain. His father, Howard, was an entomologist with a particular fondness for beetles. His mother, Margaret, a school teacher. A streak of brilliance runs through the family DNA. His uncle was the economist Colin Clark, who invented the term ""gross national product"". His great-great grandfather was the logician George Boole, who invented Boolean algebra, a foundation of modern computing.

The family moved to Bristol where Hinton attended Clifton College, a place he calls a ""second-rate public school"". It was there that a school friend first introduced Hinton to the wonders of AI by talking to him about holograms and how the brain stores memories.

I have a sort of educational ADHDProfessor Geoffrey Hinton

After school, he was awarded a place at King's College, Cambridge to read physics and chemistry but dropped out after a month. ""I was 18 it was the first time I had lived apart from home. It was awfully hard work, there weren't any girls and I got depressed,"" he says.

The following year he re-applied to read architecture but again dropped out - this time after just a day - and switched instead to physics and physiology. He then changed again to philosophy but ended up falling out with his tutors. ""I have a sort of educational ADHD,"" he admits.

Rather than complete his studies, Hinton quit and moved to the then insalubrious streets of Islington, north London, where he became a jobbing carpenter. ""I made shelves, hung doors, nothing fancy. The sort of stuff people get paid for.""

Each Saturday morning he would go to Islington's Essex Road library - the same establishment where Sixties playwright Joe Orton used to deface the books with pornographic images - and jot down in his notebook theories about how the brain worked.

After a few years of toil, he returned to academia and in 1973 started a PHD in artificial intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. His tutors regularly told him he was wasting his time on neural networks, but Hinton plugged on regardless.

He moved to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh to continue his research, but soon realised the Department of Defence (DoD) was funding much of the work on AI in his department and across the US. He quit in protest to move to Canada where military funding was less pernicious.

""When I left, I took an American penny and blew it up with a Xerox machine and put it up on my office door,"" he says. ""But I changed the 'G' to a 'D' so it read: in DoD we trust.""

According to Hinton, rather than fearing the growing intelligence of machines a far more pressing threat to humanity is the development of killer robots (underlined this week by a petition signed by the founders of 116 AI companies to the UN calling for a ban on lethal autonomous weapons).

Hinton has signed a similar petition himself and previously wrote to express his concerns to Britain's Ministry of Defence. ""The reply said there is no need to do anything about this now because the technology is a long way away, and anyway, it might be quite useful,"" he says. ""But they certainly have the capacity to do this.""

He also fears the use of AI in increasing surveillance of the civilian population and reveals he once declined a job to sit on the board of the Canadian equivalent of the NSA because of fears over how his research could be abused by the security services.

Still, even while discussing the terror of weaponised ""drone swarms"" currently being developed, Hinton remains evangelical about the benefits of AI - particularly in healthcare and education.

He lost his first wife, Ros, to ovarian cancer in 1994 leaving him to look after their two young adopted children as a single parent. He later re-married to his current wife, Jackie, but says she too has now been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

Medicine, he believes, will become far more efficient as a result of AI. Soon he envisages anybody being able to pay $100 to have their genome mapped (the current cost is $1,000). Unpopular as it makes him with radiologists, Hinton also believes X-ray detection could soon be largely robot work.

Jobs will be lost, but he insists it is the job of governments and business to ensure that the next automation of our economy does not leave people behind.

""In a sensibly organised society, if you improve productivity there is room for everybody to benefit,"" he says. ""The problem is not the technology, but the way the benefits are shared out.""

Even the visionary admits he does not know where the AI revolution will take us next. ""It is very hard to predict beyond five years in this area and things always turn out differently to what you expect,"" he says.

Suffice to say, the world as we know it is about to be turned on its head."
240,240,"Wi-Fi is technology that allows computers, smartphones, or other devices to connect to the Internet within a particular area, express.co.uk reported.

It is a relatively new invention and was first released to consumers in 1997.

These days, it is virtually everywhere, and there have been increasing concerns about possible long-term damage to our health.

The technology works by using man-made radio frequency radiation in a similar way to bluetooth, microwaves and television signals.

While Wi-Fi might seem like unknown territory, there has been extensive research on radio waves for decades.

In 2013 a review published in the Radiation Safety Journal, researchers concluded that Wi-Fi technology does not pose a risk to health.

This is because the type of radiation it uses is at the low-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum.

According to the American Cancer Society, this has enough energy to move atoms in a molecule around or cause them to vibrate, but not enough to ionize.

This is in contrast to high-energy radiation -- such as X-rays -- which have been linked to increased risk of cancer.

What's more, unless you're constantly streaming video, Wi-Fi devices only usually transmit information just 0.1 percent of the time.

In comparison, mobile phones transmit -- next to your head -- at a strength a hundred times more powerful during a call.

Even then, current research has found no adverse effects from constant phone use for a decade.

That might change for longer use, and the World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on Cancer have stated that mobiles are 'possible carcinogen' because there's currently not enough long-term research to say whether it does or not.

However, some research does appear to have found a link between Wi-Fi and health issues.

A 2016 study published in the journal Endocrine associated high levels of Wi-Fi and mobile phone exposure to hormonal shifts and oxidative stress, which could lead to cancer or brain diseases.

There are also concerns about how radio wave radiation might harm children.

In 2015, nurseries in France began banning the use of Wi-Fi in nurseries after concerns from parents.

However, most experts believe it isn't a danger.

Cancer Research UK state on their website: ""There has been some media speculation that Wireless Internet (Wi-Fi) and smart meters, which can be used to record energy use in your home and transmit it back to your energy provider, could cause cancer.

""The radio waves produced by Wi-Fi and smart meters are very low power, much lower than those given off by mobile phones, and well within international guidelines.

""The evidence to date suggested exposures to the radio waves produced by smart meters and Wi-Fi do not pose a health risk.""

A study conducted by Public Health England found exposure to radio waves from smart meters is well below the health regulatory guidelines set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection.

Data collected in their research demonstrated that smart meters are not a danger to health."
241,241,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has raised $US27 million for Neuralink, a company he created last year to link human brains with computers.

Neuralink has sold $US27 million worth of equity out of a total offering of $US100 million, according to a document published by the SEC on Friday. The form lists 12 unnamed investors and says that equity was first sold on August 15, 2017.

Despite the filed paperwork, Musk tweeted on Friday that ""Neuralink is not seeking investors,"" which suggests that he may be significantly contributing to the funding himself or has already locked in others backers. The paperwork lists Jared Birchall as Neuralink's president.

Representatives for Musk and Neuralink didn't respond to requests for comment.

Musk started Neuralink last summer to link the human brain with computers by creating micron-sized devices to be surgically implanted into the brain. The startup is aiming to bring to market a product that helps with certain severe brain injuries due to stroke and cancer lesion in about four years.

Musk has described the need to create a ""neural lace"" device that's capable of supercharging the human brain. He has said that such a device would help humans combat the existential threat of artificially intelligent super-computers. Such a device would also allow humans to engage in ""consensual telepahy.""

Neuralink's website currently lists 8 job openings, including a chip designer, mechanical engineer, and a few software engineers.

Neuralink is Musk's fourth company. He is also the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and OpenAI, a non-profit AI research company. He also leads a tunnelling startup called The Boring Company, which started as an offshoot of SpaceX."

His latest company Neuralink is working to link the human brain with a machine interface by creating micron-sized devices (stock image)

'If you have two brain interfaces, you could actually do an uncompressed direct conceptual communication with another person.'

He said the time before the devices are released depend on regulatory approval and how well the devices work on people with disabilities.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning will create computers so sophisticated and godlike that humans will need to implant 'neural laces' in their brains to keep up, Musk said in a tech conference last year.

In June, Musk said Neuralink is a priority after much more demanding commitments to his automotive and rocket companies.

'Boring Co. is maybe 2 percent of my time; Neuralink is 3 percent to 5 percent of my time; OpenAI is going to be a couple of percent; and then 90-plus percent is divided between SpaceX and Tesla,' said Musk at the electric-car maker's annual shareholder meeting.

But in a recent interview with Y Combinator, Musk explained that the 'best outcome' between humankind and machines would be a collective lifestyle where 'we are the AI.'

Neuralink will work on what Musk calls the 'neural lace' technology, implanting tiny brain electrodes that may one day alter thoughts. Pictured, Keanu Reeves plugging into 'The Matrix'

Such a scenario would stamp out the possibility of an 'evil dictator AI,' Musk said, allowing anyone who wants to take part to become an 'AI-human symbiote.'

Musk likened the situation to the cooperation of the limbic system and the cortex in the human brain.

In the interview, he explained that these two systems - the primitive brain that controls your instincts, and the 'thinking part,' respectively - work well together, and it would extremely unusual to find someone who wished to get rid of one of them.

Building off of this, he told Y Combinator, 'I think if we can effectively merge with AI, like improving the neural link between the cortex and your digital extension of yourself, which already exists but just has a bandwidth issue, then effectively, you become an AI-human symbiote.'

This would also solve the 'control problem,' he went on to explain, as it could become so widespread that 'anyone who wants it can have it.'

'We don't have to worry about some evil dictator AI,' Musk told Y Combinator, 'because we are the AI collectively.

'That seems like the best outcome I can think of.'"
244,244,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has raised $27 million for Neuralink, another company he created last year to link human brains with computers.

Neuralink has sold $27 million worth of equity out of a total offering of $100 million, according to a document published by the SEC on Friday. The form lists 12 unnamed investors and says that equity was first sold on August 15, 2017.

Despite the filed paperwork, Must tweeted on Friday that ""Neuralink is not seeking investors,"" which suggests that he may be significantly contributing to the funding himself. The paperwork lists Jared Birchall as Neuralink's president.

Representatives for Must and Neuralink didn't respond to requests for comment.

Musk started Neuralink last summer to link the human brain with computers by creating micron-sized devices to be surgically implanted into the brain. The startup is aiming to bring to market a product that helps with certain severe brain injuries due to stroke and cancer lesion in about four years.

Neuralink's website currently lists 8 job openings, including a chip designer, mechanical engineer, and a few software engineers.

Neuralink is Musk's fourth company. He is also the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and OpenAI, a non-profit AI research company. He also leads a tunneling startup called The Boring Company, which started as an offshoot of SpaceX."

On television, a sleek black sedan pulls up to a sprawling estate with a rolling green lawn as a mother recounts how Recovery Centers of America saved her child from drugs. On Facebook, radio, highway billboards, and commuter trains, people are urged to call the company's instantly memorable hot line: 1-800-RECOVERY.

The marketing blitz and an infusion of private equity money have helped make Recovery Centers of America into the self-described fastest-growing addiction treatment provider in the country. Launched less than three years ago by a high-end real estate developer, it's part of a rush of entrepreneurs who see opportunity in the treatment business as the opioid crisis sweeps the country.

But an investigation by STAT and The Boston Globe has uncovered evidence of shoddy care and turmoil inside the walls of the company's two Massachusetts treatment centers. This report is based on interviews with more than a dozen former and current employees, internal RCA documents, and state investigative reports -- depicting a company that spends lavishly on facilities and marketing while skimping on giving patients basic care.

At a company that promotes itself as the new frontier of addiction treatment and charges an average of $24,000 a month, some patients were not getting basic counseling. They were often unsupervised. The staff has complained repeatedly to management and the state that they weren't able to keep the patients safe. And patients were found to be having sex.

RCA operates luxury residential and outpatient facilities in five Northeastern states, featuring original artwork, custom furniture, and manicured gardens. In Massachusetts alone, the company has spent nearly $50 million to buy and renovate a country inn in the rolling hills of Westminster and the former Hunt Hospital in Danvers.

""RCA is 100 percent committed to our patients and their paths to recovery,"" according to a statement from the company. ""At the very core of our facilities and mission is a steadfast dedication to the highest standards and regulations, and the care and safety of every individual we treat and employ.""

In Westminster, patients sleep on Serta Prestige Suite II Pillow Top mattresses selected after company executives tested more than 30 brands. Each day, fresh linens are carefully folded and placed on the end of patient beds. Every room has a flat-screen television and private bathroom.

But when state regulators inspected the facility in February, they found that essential services like individual counseling and group therapy sessions were not regularly being provided, worker training was lacking, the facility was understaffed, and patients were not properly supervised.

One staff member complained to the state that patients were trading their medications for financial and physical favors. Staff members grew so incensed about conditions inside the facility that one wrote an inflammatory e-mail to management.

""Our patient to staff ratio is exhausting for us and non therapeutic for the patients,"" wrote one employee in a January e-mail to management at Westminster obtained by STAT and the Globe. ""The patients who should in no way even still be with us are taking advantage of our lack of staff by turning us into a drug hotel and brothel rather than a recovery center and the ones who are with us to make an attempt at meaningful recovery are feeling ignored, stressed, and unprepared for after their stay.""

The state report did not indicate that investigators found drugs inside the facility. In a statement, RCA said of the e-mail, ""We will not respond to accusations that are unfounded.""

RCA also said it conducted its own investigation and determined the state findings of staff shortages and lack of programming were wrong, and that, in fact, RCA had more staffing and treatment services than required. The records that the state viewed were incomplete, RCA said.

At Danvers, which state investigators visited once in May and again in July, the state found an understaffed facility where patients wandered freely, taking the elevators to the roof and other floors to smoke and have sex -- and where RCA consistently failed to notify the state about incidents within the facility. In one case, according to a police report attached to the state complaint, a patient drank hand sanitizer -- which contains alcohol -- and RCA staff attempted to wave off an ambulance called for him.

The company said it prohibits sex between patients. Regarding the finding that patients were allowed to walk freely within the building, RCA said that ""patient freedom is beneficial to patients' recovery,"" because it prepares them for responsible life in the ""real world."" However, the company said it did add staff to comply with the state's concerns about staffing. RCA declined to comment on the patient who drank hand sanitizer, citing privacy.

In response to questions from STAT and the Globe, state regulators said in a statement that they found ""troubling lapses in the company's policies and procedures"" and have yet to issue full operating licenses to the two Massachusetts centers. The state is currently investigating the deaths of two Danvers patients, one in February and one this month. RCA also operates in New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.

One patient in particular concerned staff: Charles, a 47-year-old from Georgia who sought treatment first in Westminster and then in Danvers. STAT and the Globe are identifying him using only his middle name at his family's request. RCA said it could not discuss his care because of patient privacy laws.

Charles's care was overseen directly by the facility's medical director, John Halpern -- a doctor with a sterling resume, but a past that includes a role in allegedly helping to launder money for a massive LSD-trafficking operation. He was never charged in the case.

A relative of Charles said he was placed at RCA because ""in an under-addressed epidemic, we were fortunate to find RCA to help in a unique situation.""

But workers repeatedly raised concerns about Charles's treatment to the company and the state, according to state reports.

""At times it was observed that he was nodding out and appeared over-medicated,"" wrote one fired staff member in a letter to the state on Feb. 15. ""We were told that he and his family had an endless supply of money and we were to do whatever we had to to keep him in the facility.""

By then, Charles had been moved to Danvers. Seven days later, he was dead.

When state investigators showed up to inspect Westminster last February, one employee who had repeatedly complained about conditions there was told by management to ""hide,"" according to a state complaint.

In a message exchange cited in a lawsuit against RCA, the employee texted a manager on the second day of the state's review, asking why.

""hahaha,"" came the response. ""bc what we do isn't legal.""

The February inspection was one of three by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health conducted at Westminster and Danvers this year -- all finding that RCA has failed to meet basic requirements. Westminster opened in October with 48 beds, and Danvers, called the Boston Center for Addiction Treatment, opened in January and now has 72 beds. Both are in the midst of expansions.

Detailed letters from staff members contained in two of the state files show employees who are by turns disgusted, angry, and anguished over the care their patients are receiving.

""I felt as though there was good to be done here and that we would be helping those truly in need. This was obviously my naivety taking over,"" wrote one former Westminster staff member. ""Many of the practices and decisions I have seen implemented at RCA has been motivated by, no surprise here, MONEY.""

Short-staffing meant that employees couldn't properly watch patients, staffers wrote, and some patients rarely saw their therapists. The state found that RCA had one case manager and two therapists or counselors providing services for both detox and its longer-term inpatient unit.

Three people said they had been fired after raising flags to management about conditions inside the facility, though the state did not address the alleged firings in its final report.

""Talk too much or know too much and termination is imminent and swift,"" wrote one employee to state inspectors, adding they were fired after reporting ""many, many"" infractions to management.

RCA denied the allegations contained in the employee letters, calling the writers ""a limited number of disgruntled employees who acted in a coordinated manner by writing letters of accusation to [the state] within the same 24 hour period.""

Payroll records and surveillance video showed the facility was not understaffed and that services were provided, RCA said. The company disputed the allegation that an employee was told to ""hide,"" saying that in fact she was invited to meet with state inspectors and declined. RCA did not offer an explanation for the text message. The state did not address whether employees were told to hide.

Paintings of celebrities with alleged addictions hung in the lobby in Danvers.

In Danvers, an employee who said they were dismissed in July wrote to the state with a detailed list of safety concerns, including that staff would be absent ""for several hours"" at a time; that responses to patient emergencies were slow; and that patients ""routinely"" drank Purell hand sanitizer from the nurses station.

On June 27, the employee wrote, a patient who was stumbling and smelled of alcohol confessed to drinking Purell. Nursing staff called 911, but according to a police report, someone canceled the ambulance. Police arrived and recalled the ambulance and described the patient as ""intoxicated and belligerent,"" according to the police report.

RCA said in a statement about the second Danvers investigation simply that it was closed, and declined to comment on the Purell allegations, citing patient privacy.

RCA boasts that it is ""transforming the way treatment is delivered in an industry in desperate need of change.""

There is no single treatment standard for drug addiction, and regulations on acceptable staff and patient ratios vary from state to state. Among the dozens of treatment approaches are abstinence-only, 12-step programs; cognitive behavioral therapy; and medication-assisted therapies like methadone and Suboxone. Some centers use a combination of approaches. Facilities can seek voluntary national accreditation offered by two private companies, but only about half do so.

The Westminster facility is accredited, and Danvers is seeking accreditation. Specific staffing ratios the state found at the two facilities were not included in the state reports.

In a statement, a spokesman for the Department of Public Health said the agency ""has investigated complaints from former employees of Recovery Centers of America (RCA) about staffing, safety and the care delivered at RCA's facilities in Westminster and Danvers. We validated many of those concerns and found troubling lapses in the company's policies and procedures designed to ensure that patients are safely assessed, treated and monitored during their program of care.""

The company has made improvements, state officials said, but is being closely monitored.

Internal RCA e-mails obtained by STAT and the Globe detail complaints from patients about poor care in Westminster.

""I chose RCA Westminster because of the holistic approach that is stressed on the website. I knew that farm-to-table dining, equine therapy, acupuncture, martial arts, yoga, massage therapy, and state of the art exercise equipment as well as a spiritual atmosphere would help me begin my recovery,"" wrote one patient in an e-mail in January. ""There are no horses, acupuncture, martial arts, or sufficient exercise equipment and I'm not sure if Sysco food deliveries really count as 'farm-to-table.'""

Keith Bedford/Globe Staff

The patient said that during her six-day stay, she met only once with her therapist and twice with her case manager, and no meeting lasted more than 15 minutes.

RCA said it offers ""patients double the amount of counseling then is required by the state"" and that patient satisfaction at its facilities is high. As for the promised programs that were never offered, such as equine therapy, RCA blamed that on a failure to update the facility's website. The company said it does offer farm-to-table food through a vendor.

In March, Westminster's former quality assurance manager filed a wrongful termination lawsuit in Worcester Superior Court, which echoed the complaints of many other Westminster employees about inadequate staffing and patient safety. Nabil Georges alleged that RCA Westminster falsified state documents, operated a facility where patients had sex, did drugs, and went without therapy, and where employees -- including himself -- were fired for complaining.

In August, after STAT and the Globe had begun investigating RCA, the company sued Georges in federal court in Pennsylvania. The lawsuit seeks to bar Georges from divulging ""confidential information"" relating to his employment at RCA to the press.

""Mr. Georges has come forward with these complaints and taken great personal risk to protect future patients at these facilities,"" said Georges's attorney, John T. Martin.

""These are the perfect victims, because when they are in addiction treatment, they usually have criminal histories, they usually have a history of relapse, and when they claim that nobody helped them, no one believes them.""

RCA said the allegations contained in Georges's complaint were ""without merit.""

For all the difficulties, there are those who credit RCA with saving their lives, and the company has energetically promoted those successes stories. RCA cites its internal data showing that 70 percent of RCA's patients are still off drugs a month after their discharge. The company also provided STAT and the Globe with scores of written testimonials from employees, patients, and other treatment specialists that provide examples of success stories at RCA.

The company has highlighted the case of Jason Amaral, 31, who was featured in a CBS News series that tracked his recovery from addiction at an RCA facility. In the opening scenes filmed last spring, Amaral was haggard and using heroin in Boston City Hall. Now, off drugs for 19 months, he works at the Danvers facility, where he met reporters in the lobby during a recent tour arranged for STAT and the Globe.

""The big thing is, I'm happy, clean, not miserable,"" he said.

As reporters toured Westminster with RCA executives, a patient rushed into the hallway.

""I want to tell you, when I walked in the door 30 days ago, I was literally a shadow,"" the man said. ""Whatever you've done, you've done a great job.""

The opulence of the Recovery Centers of America would not surprise anyone who has followed the career of its creator: J. Brian O'Neill.

His early success in commercial real estate allowed him to buy luxury yachts, a private jet, and homes across the country. He once gave a ride to the Dalai Lama on his airplane. He purchased a country club and mansion in Newport, R.I., and became a fixture on the social scene in that summer resort.

O'Neill said in an interview that one motivation for him to enter the drug treatment business was his frustration with the lack of quality treatment centers. His only experience with addiction treatment was personal: He had helped friends get clean, he said, and conducted interventions.

The idea to open his own treatment centers came to him after the financial crisis of 2008 -- a crisis that he said ""creamed"" the real estate business, including his own. His Philadelphia-based company, O'Neill Properties Group, was ""in horrible shape,"" he said.

Keith Bedford/Globe Staff

Owner J. Brian O'Neill stood at a nurses station at the Recovery Centers for America's facility in Westminster.

It was a humbling time for O'Neill, a high-school dropout who made a fortune developing high-end residential, retail, and office properties. As he dug his way out financially, O'Neill became involved in a successful effort to save 17 Philadelphia Catholic schools from closure -- an endeavor that brought him to tears as he recounted it in a recent interview.

Then, he set his sights on the world of addiction treatment.

He took two years to create a 400-page business plan for what would become RCA. He found a deep-pocketed financial partner in New York City investment firm Deerfield Management Company, which has committed $331.5 million to help RCA develop its treatment centers. A spokesman from Deerfield declined to comment.

RCA is one of several well-funded, for-profit players expanding into the addiction treatment business. One competitor, American Addictions Centers, went public in 2014 and Deerfield is a major investor. Addiction treatment provider Summit Behavioral Health has partnered with private equity firm Flexpoint Ford LLC ""to accelerate its strategic growth.""

In getting RCA off the ground, O'Neill did what he knows best: He snapped up a former estate, a country resort, and health care facilities in New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, sinking tens of millions of dollars into renovations.

The facilities are designed to create a luxury resort ambiance. Fruit-infused water is set out in the lobbies. RCA's Maryland facility, which is featured in its television ads, is a 24,000-square-foot replica of an English country house on 557 acres of land that rolls up to tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. Patients in need of transportation are shuttled around in Mercedes-Benz 550 series sedans by full-time drivers.

""We are a big believer in creature comforts,"" O'Neill said during an interview at his company headquarters in King of Prussia, Pa.

The pool at the facility in Westminster.

As he led a tour of RCA's Danvers facility earlier this month, O'Neill complained about the quality of the coffee and a railing in need of paint, and promised to dispatch a longtime employee to fix things.

RCA's focus on five-star amenities is matched by an aggressive marketing operation that features ubiquitous television ads where it operates. The company spent nearly $2 million on television spots last year and is on pace to double that amount this year, according to Kantar Media, an independent company that monitors media buys.

O'Neill's real estate company offices have been largely taken over by RCA. On one floor is a call center -- named the ""Mission Center"" -- that takes 13,000 calls a month through the heavily promoted 1-800-RECOVERY number.

RCA ends up referring many callers to competitors, O'Neill said, because its own beds are often full -- one reason he is aggressively pushing to expand. This month, he opened a center in suburban Philadelphia that he said will be the largest facility of its kind in the country, with up to 280 beds.

O'Neill's goal is ambitious: to treat 1 million people in the next decade. When asked how he came up with that number, he said the initial figure was 50,000 but that was not ""bold enough."" He then compared his efforts to those of Michael Milken, a symbol of 1980s Wall Street excesses nicknamed ""The Junk Bond King,"" who subsequently helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars to find new treatments for prostate cancer.

""We are going to take a king-sized bat to this industry and change the way addiction is treated in this country,"" he said.

Dr. John Halpern at McLean Hospital in Belmont in 2006.

One of the medical professionals O'Neill brought in to carry out his vision is Dr. John Halpern, a psychiatrist who allegedly played a key role in helping an LSD trafficker launder money in Russia.

It was Halpern who supervised the care of Charles, the patient from Georgia who died in February.

Last year, Halpern was hired by RCA to be the medical director at its Westminster facility. After the larger Danvers facility opened in January, Halpern left Westminster for the same job there.

For most of his career, Halpern was a researcher at the highly regarded, Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital, studying the effects and potential medicinal value of hallucinogenic drugs. He has received awards and grants, published extensively, invented treatments for headaches, and testifies as an expert witness regarding hallucinogenic drugs.

He shifted his focus to clinical care more recently.

On the RCA website, Halpern's Harvard and McLean pedigrees are highlighted. But grand jury records buried in federal court filings in California and Kansas reveal the doctor's alleged role in laundering money for what the US Drug Enforcement Agency in 2003 said was the largest LSD laboratory ever seized by the agency.

Halpern was never charged in the case. He did testify about his role to a grand jury in 2004 and a DEA agent called him a ""co-conspirator"" in court proceedings.

The LSD lab was operated out of an abandoned missile silo in Kansas by two men, one of them named William Leonard Pickard. Halpern testified he met Pickard in 1995 through a mutual acquaintance. Both men were studying at Harvard at the time.

The bond between the men became stronger following a strange encounter in New Mexico. Halpern testified that he ingested a combination of plants that mimic the effects of ayahuasca, a tropical vine known for its hallucinogenic properties. The concoction caused Halpern to curl up into a ball in a bed and sob.

Halpern said Pickard showed up unannounced and started to comfort him. Pickard ""starts massaging my feet, telling me that everything is fine."" Halpern said Pickard was ""treating me in a way like a baby. If I burped, he would go, 'Mmm, yeah. Oh, yeah.' Just to try to make it humorous.""

After that, Halpern testified, he considered Pickard a ""brother from another planet.""

Pickard had money, which Halpern testified he believed came from the sale and production of LSD.

""I've never met anybody in my life who would have hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash just laying about,"" Halpern testified. ""Never in a safe, just it's in a shoe box, you know.""

Which made Pickard a prime candidate for an introduction to another of Halpern's friends, a man he grew up with, who now lived in Russia investing money in an environment Halpern described as ""anything goes.""

Halpern initially told his childhood friend that Pickard was wealthy from an inheritance, but said he eventually decided to tell him the true origins of the funds. Halpern said his friend ""could tolerate accepting money from ill-gotten gains, that this would be illegal money.""

Pickard allegedly ended up laundering as much as $3 million of drug money through Halpern's friend -- and for his role in connecting the men Halpern was to be paid a 10 percent commission, according to court records.

Pickard is serving two life terms for conspiracy to manufacture and distribute LSD.

RCA said it conducts background checks on employees and was ""aware of Dr. Halpern's acquaintance with Mr. Pickard."" The company added that ""what is more relevant to RCA is Dr. Halpern's outstanding academic and professional achievements, as both a clinician and researcher in the field of Addiction Treatment.""

The death early this year of Charles was a shock to staff at Westminster. They had warned the company and the state about Charles. He died anyway.

RCA, in a statement, said it ""cannot and will not comment on protected health information or any other details that may be related to a patient's stay or treatment.""

Charles came from a prosperous Atlanta family, but his life had been marked by tragedy. As a young man, he lost both his arms after he accidentally grabbed a power line. Later, he survived cancer. He struggled with chronic pain.

He was brilliant, well-read, and doggedly independent. He used hooks to replace his hands, and was so nimble with them that he could type and drive a car. He was gifted with computers, and came to Boston about four years ago to audit courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Here, he lived in a luxury apartment, and began associating with people who abused crack cocaine.

Charles also had a history of abusing alcohol and prescription painkillers. In Massachusetts, he sought help from Halpern before he was hired by RCA. Charles followed Halpern to Westminster when RCA hired Halpern to be the medical director there. He arrived in late fall of 2016, and his family paid cash.

The placement was unusual from the start. Halpern personally oversaw his care. ""John Halpern did nothing but help us,'' said the relative of Charles. ""He was a light in darkness for us.''

Charles left the facility at least twice, according to records obtained by STAT and the Globe, and private nurses were hired from an outside company to be with him 24 hours a day -- an arrangement the state determined in its February investigation was evidence of a patient that was ""inappropriate for that level of care.""

Staff were told Charles had a history of abusing crack cocaine, according to a state complaint. He was awaiting surgery he hoped would relieve some of his pain. The job of getting him well enough for the surgery was largely left to Halpern, according to state documents.

""We were told not to provide any case management as the doctor at the facility was in charge of him as he was a private patient of his,"" wrote one fired staff member in a letter to the state regulators in February. The staffer said that ""numerous"" warnings that the patient was not ""clinical appropriate"" went unheeded.

The staff member also told the state that Charles appeared to be overmedicated.

""It was brought to attention that he was being prescribed a large dose of suboxone up to 4 times daily for pain,"" the staff member wrote. The primary ingredient in Suboxone is buprenorphine.

Sometime around late January or early February, according to internal documents obtained by the Globe and STAT, Charles moved from the Westminster facility to Danvers. He was again following Halpern.

On Feb. 21, Charles was rushed from the Danvers RCA to the hospital.

In his body, according to his death certificate, was a toxic combination of cocaine and buprenorphine. He died a day later.

For O'Neill, the troubles at RCA are a distraction from what he describes as his company's noble purpose to help people get sober in areas of the country in desperate need of treatment options.

""When this is all said and done, you have to decide the following,"" O'Neill told reporters in a phone call to discuss questions about the quality of care in his facilities. ""Are we the good guys or the bad guys?""

246,246,"Nir Barzilai has a plan. It's a really big plan that might one day change medicine and health care as we know it. Its promise: extending our years of healthy, disease-free living by decades.

And Barzilai knows about the science of aging. He is, after all, the director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. And, as such, he usually talks about his plan with the caution of a seasoned researcher. Usually. Truth is, Barzilai is known among his colleagues for his excitability -- one author says he could pass as the older brother of Austin Powers -- and sometimes he can't help himself. Like the time he referred to his plan -- which, among other things, would demonstrate that human aging can be slowed with a cheap pill -- as ""history-making."" In 2015, he stood outside of the offices of the Food and Drug Administration, flanked by a number of distinguished researchers on aging, and likened the plan to a journey to ""the promised land.""

Last spring, Barzilai traveled to the Vatican to discuss the plan at a conference on cellular therapies. It was the second time he'd been invited to the conference, which is a pretty big deal in the medical world. At the last one, in 2013, he appeared alongside a dwarf from Ecuador, a member of a community of dwarfs whose near immunity to diabetes and cancer has attracted the keen interest of researchers. The 2016 conference featured a number of the world's top cancer scientists and included addresses from Pope Francis and Joe Biden. That Barzilai was invited was a sign not only of his prominence in his field but also of how far aging research, once relegated to the periphery of mainstream science, has come in recent years.

That progress has been spurred by huge investments from Silicon Valley titans, including Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison. Armed with such riches, biotech researchers are now dreaming up a growing list of cribbed-from-science-fiction therapies to beat back death: growing new organs from your own DNA, infusing older bodies with blood and stem cells from young bodies, uploading brains to computers.

Almost nothing seems too far-fetched in the so-called life-extension community. And yet, while it's certainly possible that this work will lead to a breakthrough that will benefit all of humanity, it's hard to escape the sense that Silicon Valley's newfound urge to postpone aging indefinitely is, first and foremost, an attempt by the super wealthy to extend their own lives. As one scientist recently put it to The New Yorker, the antiaging science being done at Google-backed Calico Labs is ""as self-serving as the Medici building a Renaissance chapel in Italy, but with a little extra Silicon Valley narcissism thrown in.""

Barzilai's big plan isn't necessarily less quixotic than those being dreamed up at Silicon Valley biotechs. It's just quixotic in a completely different way. Rather than trying to develop a wildly expensive, highly speculative therapy that will likely only benefit the billionaire-demigod set, Barzilai wants to convince the FDA to put its seal of approval on an antiaging drug for the rest of us: A cheap, generic, demonstrably safe pharmaceutical that has already shown, in a host of preliminary studies, that it may be able to help stave off many of the worst parts of growing old. Not only that, it would also shorten the duration of those awful parts. (""How To Die Young at a Very Old Age"" was the title of his 2014 talk at TEDx Gramercy in New York City.)

The drug in question, metformin, costs about five cents a pill. It's a slightly modified version of a compound that was discovered in a plant, Galega officinalis. The plant, also known as French lilac and goat's rue, is hardly the stuff of cutting-edge science. Physicians have been prescribing it as an herbal remedy for centuries. In 1640, the great English herbalist John Parkinson wrote about goat's rue in his life's work, Theatrum Botanicum, recommending it for ""the bitings or stings of any venomous creature,"" ""the plague,"" ""measells,"" ""small pocks,"" and ""wormes in children,"" among other conditions.

According to some sources, goat's rue was also a centuries-old remedy for frequent urination, now known to be a telltale sign of diabetes. Today, metformin, which helps keep blood sugar levels in check without serious side effects, is typically the first-choice treatment for type 2 diabetics, and it's sometimes prescribed for prediabetes as well. Together, the two conditions afflict half of American adults. In 2014 alone, Americans filled 76.9 million prescriptions for metformin, and some of those prescriptions went to Barzilai himself. (He's been taking the drug since he was diagnosed with prediabetes around six years ago.)

A native Israeli, Barzilai speaks English with an accent, never letting grammatical slipups slow him down. He has short, boyish bangs and a slightly rounded face. His thick glasses and natural exuberance give him the look of an actor typecast as an eccentric researcher. He traces his interest in aging to the Sabbath walks he took with his grandfather as a child. Barzilai could never quite reconcile the frailty of the old man with his grandfather's stories of draining swamps in prestate Israel. ""I was looking and saying, 'This guy? This old guy could do that?'""

Barzilai first studied metformin in the late 1980s while doing a fellowship at Yale, never imagining the drug would later become his focus. When the FDA approved it as a diabetes treatment in 1994, there was little reason to think it would someday become one of the hottest topics in medicine. But in the following two decades, researchers started comparing the health of diabetics on metformin to those taking other diabetes drugs.

What they discovered was striking: The metformin-takers tended to be healthier in all sorts of ways. They lived longer and had fewer cardiovascular events, and in at least some studies they were less likely to suffer from dementia and Alzheimer's. Most surprising of all, they seemed to get cancer far less frequently -- as much as 25 to 40 percent less than diabetics taking two other popular medications. When they did get cancer, they tended to outlive diabetics with cancer who were taking other medications.

As Lewis Cantley, the director of the Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine, once put it, ""Metformin may have already saved more people from cancer deaths than any drug in history."" Nobel laureate James Watson (of DNA-structure fame), who takes metformin off-label for cancer prevention, once suggested that the drug appeared to be ""our only real clue into the business"" of fighting the disease.

The more researchers learn about metformin, the more it can seem like a medieval wonder drug poised for a 21st century resurgence. In addition to exploring its potential to help treat the most common afflictions of aging, researchers are now also investigating whether metformin might improve symptoms of autoimmune disorders, tuberculosis, and erectile dysfunction, among other conditions. And while much of this research is still in its early stages and may fizzle, metformin is already prescribed off-label to treat obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, infertility, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and acne -- not bad for a plant that the USDA officially lists as a noxious weed.

Barzilai, like most in his field, was aware of the good news about metformin that had been trickling out year after year. But the true origins of his big plan have less to do with metformin itself than with a convergence of a number of different strands of aging research. The first breakthroughs came in the '90s, when researchers demonstrated that a single mutation in a microscopic worm could double its lifespan. Among the takeaways: The aging process might not be as hopelessly complex as it had previously seemed. As this new understanding of aging was settling in, Barzilai was beginning a series of studies on people who live to unusually old ages -- ""superagers,"" as Barzilai calls them.

In the course of that work, he began to notice a pattern that other researchers had also seen: The superagers died from the same diseases as everyone else, but they developed them years later and, critically, closer to the ends of their lives. In other words, if you could slow the aging process, you might do more than give someone a few more years. You could also be able to shrink the suffering and enormous expense that accompanies cancer, heart disease, dementia, and all the other plagues of growing old.

The true promise of antiaging drugs, Barzilai and his colleagues came to think, wasn't immortality. The ideal drug might not even extend life for all that long. Instead, it would extend what Barzilai and his colleagues call our health span -- the years of healthy, disease-free living before the diseases of aging set in. S. Jay Olshansky, a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is advising a small team of researchers who are working with Barzilai on a new study of metformin's antiaging properties. He believes that even a modest slowing of the aging process -- and the subsequent extension of health span -- would have a greater impact on health and quality of life than a cure for cancer. The upshot: a multitrillion-dollar economic benefit in the decades ahead.

In 2013, Barzilai and two other researchers received a small grant from the National Institute on Aging to explore how the field might move forward. That grant, in turn, led to a 2014 conference in the Spanish countryside, where several dozen researchers gathered in a medieval castle turned hotel to map out a path forward. The castle, surrounded by ancient stone walls and towers, was the sort of place where goat's rue may have once been handed out by local herbalists. Barzilai describes it as a ""Spanish prison."" But the isolation of the setting turned out to be a good thing. ""We were stuck in this place with one another,"" says Steven Austad, a researcher at the University of Alabama. ""It was really quite intense.""

The assembled scientists and academics focused on one obstacle above all: the Food and Drug Administration. The agency does not recognize aging as a medical condition, meaning a drug cannot be approved to treat it. And even if the FDA were to acknowledge that aging is a condition worthy of targeting, there would still be the question of how to demonstrate that aging had, in fact, been slowed -- a particularly difficult question considering that there are no universally agreed-on markers. What they needed, Barzilai and the others concluded, was a precedent-setting test case -- a single study that would change the rules forever, not unlike how trial lawyers search for a perfect plaintiff when they're going to the Supreme Court to set a new legal precedent.

Which drug to use for this precedent-setting case was less obvious. Austad was among those who favored a drug called rapamycin, which has been shown to outperform metformin in studies of longevity in animals. But Barzilai was concerned about rapamycin's powerful side effects. (An immunosuppressant, it raises the risk of opportunistic infections.) ""One thing I don't want to do is to kill anyone,"" Barzilai tells me.

He was confident that metformin was good enough for the job. He has maintained this confidence ever since he read a 2014 study that reviewed the fate of 90,400 type 2 diabetics taking either metformin or another medication. The metformin patients in the study not only outlived the diabetics taking the other drug -- a not especially surprising result if metformin is a superior treatment -- but also outlived the nondiabetics studied as a comparison.

In the end, the scientists holed up in the Spanish prison settled on an unusual clinical trial designed to test whether metformin can, in addition to extending life, delay the onset of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. The FDA will not make its decision on whether metformin becomes the US's first antiaging drug until the study, dubbed Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME for short), is complete. That won't happen for at least another five years. But, based on their June 2015 meeting with FDA officials, Barzilai and his colleagues are optimistic that the FDA is onboard. ""Within five minutes, we were all in complete agreement that this is plausible"" and ""a good idea,"" S. Jay Olshansky says.

Barzilai was not scheduled to speak until the third and final day of the Vatican conference. So for the first two days he busied himself mingling with other conference attendees, often approaching them and lifting the IDs hanging from their necks up to his face so that he could make out their names. One night, he turned to an elderly woman in his hotel elevator and asked how old she was, something he often does out of professional interest. Regardless of what number these women offer up, Barzilai always tell them they are, in fact, biologically younger. When Barzilai and the woman got off on the same floor of the hotel, he took her hand and led her in a little dance. ""My continuous mitzvah project is to dance with elderly women,"" he tells me, using the Hebrew word for ""good deed.""

When it was finally his turn to address the conference, Barzilai began by pointing out that the likelihood of being diagnosed with a deadly chronic disease, such as cancer, heart disease, or Alzheimer's, increases dramatically as we age. The current approach of treating each illness separately, he suggested, ultimately amounts to a fool's errand. We survive cancer only to get heart disease a few years later, or vice versa. ""Unless we target aging itself,"" he announced, ""all we can hope is that we switch one disease for another.""

If and when the FDA approves the first antiaging drug, Barzilai believes it will create a domino effect of health and economic benefits: Insurance companies will begin to cover antiaging drugs, and pharmaceutical companies, in turn, will begin investing more in antiaging research and produce new and better drugs that extend human health span. Whether all these benefits will come to pass is hard to know. Big Pharma's hesitancy to dive into antiaging drugs may have as much to do with past failures as the FDA. In 2008, GlaxoSmithKline spent $720 million on a biotech company that many believed would develop antiaging drugs from resveratrol, a compound found in red-wine grapes. Five years later, after a series of failed trials, the company killed the initiative.

Thus far, getting the FDA excited about TAME has proven to be less challenging than convincing someone to pay for the study. Because metformin is a generic, there is no pot of gold waiting for investors at the end of the process. The TAME trial, which will enroll approximately 3,000 men and women between the ages of 65 and 79 at 14 centers across the country, is projected to cost $69 million. Barzilai is counting on the National Institutes of Health to cover a significant share of the cost, and he has been directly involved in lobbying the agency to back the study. (When he met with Mississippi senator Thad Cochran, he joked that Mississippians need a drug like metformin because they are victims of the state's great food and can't stop eating.)

The rest of the money will need to come from private donations. Barzilai recently told me that a billionaire, who insists on remaining anonymous, is considering matching the NIH funding. But, for now, Barzilai still has little to show in the way of locked-down TAME funding beyond the money that he, his wife, and his in-laws have given to the American Federation for Aging Research, the organization sponsoring the trial. ""Rich people are interested in aging,"" he says. ""They call me to prescribe metformin, but they don't understand that I'm doing something that's more profound.""

But if the antiaging gurus aren't ready to pour their millions into a metformin study just yet, that doesn't mean they're not interested in the drug. Another member of the aging panel at the Vatican, Robert Hariri, cofounder and president of genetic sequencing pioneer Craig Venter's Human Longevity Cellular Therapeutics, noted during the discussion that he takes metformin (he claims that it has improved his eyesight), as do Ray Kurzweil, of Singularity fame, and Ned David, cofounder of Silicon Valley startup Unity Biotechnology, which is developing its own antiaging drugs.

In his recent book Tools of Titans, Silicon Valley self-help guru Tim Ferriss introduces readers to ""billionaires, icons, and world-class performers"" so that the rest of us might discover the secrets of their success. Ferriss estimates that a dozen of the people featured in the book take metformin. The problem is that ""metformin is available"" already, Barzilai told me. ""The wealthy donors ""want to concentrate on the next one that will allow them to live forever.""

With so many potential uses, it can be difficult to avoid the conclusion that metformin is too good to be true, and some of the hype may yet prove to be overblown. Many of the most exciting cancer findings linked to the drug, for instance, come from observational studies of diabetics. They show a correlation between metformin and lower cancer rates, but don't prove that the compound is responsible for those outcomes or that they extend to nondiabetics. It's possible that, rather than metformin lowering cancer risk, the other diabetes medications are increasing it.

It's also possible that, as some metformin skeptics have argued, a lack of statistical rigor has exaggerated some of the most sensational cancer findings. And while evidence from observational studies of cancer patients has been supported by animal experiments as well as by human trials that measure markers of cancer, when it comes to the most important test of a cancer treatment -- whether a drug actually extends life -- metformin has thus far been a bust. In two controlled trials involving patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, a notoriously difficult cancer to treat, metformin failed to provide any benefit.

But while it's possible that metformin won't live up to the excitement it has generated, it's also possible that the compound, or a very closely related one, may turn out to be even more promising than the current scientific literature suggests. Because it's no longer under patent, metformin is widely studied, and yet, for the same reason, it doesn't benefit from the rigorous (and expensive) multistage pharmaceutical drug development process that could determine the most effective dose for cancer or which patients are most likely to respond to treatment. ""I don't think the trials have been done in a very rational way,"" says Navdeep S. Chandel, a metabolism researcher at Northwestern University who studies metformin. ""The antidiabetic dose that you give to patients might not be enough metformin"" for cancer.

If researchers don't yet know the best way to treat cancer with metformin, they are making real progress on the long-standing question of how it works inside our cells. After a patient takes a metformin tablet, much of the drug ends up in the liver, where it disrupts the process by which cells break down and burn nutrients with oxygen for energy.

If metformin shut down the oxygen reactions completely, it would be deadly -- that's how cyanide works. But the drug merely interferes with one stage of the multistage process by which the energy from nutrients makes its way to oxygen. Michael Pollak, a cancer researcher at McGill University who has studied metformin, compares it to water that's sprinkled on flames -- the fire slows down but doesn't get extinguished.

It's possible that metformin treats cancer and other conditions directly by interfering with energy production and, in the process, reducing inflammation. But the cascade of metabolic changes that follow may be even more important. When liver cells are in a state of energy stress, they begin sending out less glucose. ""If you're running out of energy yourself, you don't want to give it to the rest of your body,"" Pollak says.

Lower glucose, in turn, means that the pancreas needs to send out less insulin, the hormone that tells cells to take up and store nutrients. And it's this indirect influence on insulin that many researchers now point to as a possible explanation for many of metformin's remarkable range of benefits. Too much insulin has been linked to almost every condition metformin appears to treat, including aging.

The biological logic of the link among glucose, insulin, and aging wasn't hard for researchers to unravel. Insulin sends a message to our cells that nutrients are available, meaning it's time to grow and proliferate. When the levels of the hormones drop, it's a signal to cells that its time to enter a life-extending mode of conservation. Such a system makes evolutionary sense. It would have allowed an organism to survive periods of food scarcity with the hope of reproducing when better times arrived. It could also explain why very low-calorie diets can significantly extend life in animals. Metformin is often said to mimic the effects of a low-calorie diet -- a pill that offers the benefits of eating less, without leaving you hungry.

Aging in humans is considerably more complicated than aging in microscopic worms and other model organisms, including fruit flies and mice. But evolution builds on what comes before, and the mechanisms have fundamental similarities across species. ""Cancer in each individual is a different and specific disease. The genome of the cancer is different,"" Barzilai says. ""A lot of aging is the same in yeasts and in flies and in nematodes and in mice and in rats and in humans."" Barzilai's English begins to falter under the weight of his enthusiasm. ""We're not going to prevent every disease in the world,"" he says. But we can target ""this risk factor of aging that is so important, and take it out of the table.""

When Barzilai's Vatican panel ended, the conference paused for a scheduled break and the attendees surged forward to ask him about metformin. He told a man in an expensive-looking suit that if he didn't want to pay $20 a month in the US, he could get metformin for $2 a month in Mexico. When another man asked Barzilai what dosage he should take, Barzilai turned to the woman by his side and asked her how much longer she wanted him to remain alive.

Barzilai seemed entirely in his element as he whizzed around the room, shaking hands and cracking jokes. But when it was just the two of us, he looked momentarily deflated. I asked him what was wrong. He told me that the moderator had cut the session short before he'd had a chance to mention the most important thing about his plan to change health care with his groundbreaking metformin study: ""I wanted to say what it costs, and ask if somebody here is ready to fund it."""
247,247,"A nip is in the air, as summer eases into the fall season. Football season starts, and so does school. The holidays are right around the corner. So is the flu season. To help keep you healthy over the next few months, we've got these tips:

1. Take a Tailgate Time-out

It's an all-American past-time -- the tailgate party! Tailgating today has progressed far beyond burgers and chips. You'll find everything from cheese dip to spicy chicken wings.

Don't despair: Your tailgate spread doesn't have to sideline your weight loss plan. Grilled kabobs are great fare on the field. Just skewer veggies, fruits, and lean meat, and soak in your favorite marinade. Seafood, salsas, wraps, and stews are good eating, too. A Crock-Pot of chili -- loaded with high-fiber, high-protein beans -- is a classic tailgate dish (don't forget the Beano).

Just remember, alcohol is packed with calories. Enjoy your favorite brew, but switch it out for zero-calorie beverages as the party rolls along. It's all in how you play the game!

2. Sleep Tips to Help Kids' Weight

Does your child get enough sleep? If not, it could affect more than sleepiness at school. Studies suggest there may be a link between skimping on sleep and being overweight. Sleep shortfalls may increase hunger hormones -- so kids eat more. Also, kids are less likely to get exercise (and burn off calories) when they're tired.

To help kids and teens get a good night's sleep:

Remove TVs, computers, and gadgets from kids' bedrooms.

Avoid large meals before bedtime.

Develop a regular bedtime routine.

Set firm bedtimes and wake times.

Make sure the bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing -- and not too hot or cold.

Help kids quiet down a few hours before bedtime.

Heavy studying, text messaging, or video games should end in early evening.

How much sleep do schoolkids need? It depends on the child. But here are some general guidelines from the National Sleep Foundation:

If you've finally decided to kick the habit, there's good news: Quitting smoking won't make you gain weight over the long term. Some people pick up 4 or 5 pounds early on, but that's only temporary.

To quit successfully, experts agree, get help and support from your doctor, family, friends, and co-workers. A doctor or mental health professional can help you tailor an approach that best suits you. There are many FDA-approved medications to help people quit smoking.

Combine medication with other quit strategies -- like avoiding your smoking triggers or changing your daily routine -- and you greatly increase your odds of quitting for good.

Another tip: Some foods and drinks make cigarettes taste better; some make them taste worse. Try eating more vegetables and less meat -- and swap that coffee (or alcohol) for a glass of milk. Let your taste buds stifle those cravings!

4. Flu Vaccine? Who? You.

As temperatures get chillier and people spend more time indoors, flu season sneaks in. Because the flu virus can infect the lungs, it can cause a serious complication like pneumonia -- which can require hospitalization, even lead to death. That's why certain people must get a flu shot.

October or November is the best time to get vaccinated, but you can still get vaccinated in December or later. Flu season can start as early as October and last as late as May.

If you live with or care for a child under 2 years old, you are in a priority group for flu shots.

There are two types of flu vaccines: flu shots and nasal sprays. The flu shot vaccine is recommended for:

Children aged 6 months to 19 years.

Pregnant women.

People age 50 and older.

People of any age with chronic medical conditions such as asthma.

People living in nursing homes or other long-term facilities.

Others who could get Flu Mist nasal spray include healthy people 2-49 years old who are not pregnant.

Also, protect yourself and your child from catching or spreading viruses:

Cover nose and mouth with a tissue when you sneeze or cough. Throw it away afterward.

Wash your hands frequently with soap and water -- especially important after you cough or sneeze on them. Use an alcohol-based hand cleaner if necessary.

Keep you and your baby away from people who are coughing or sneezing.

Try not to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth -- since that's how germs are spread

In 2009, the H1N1 swine flu, a new flu virus, emerged. This virus spreads from person to person like seasonal flu, mainly through coughing or sneezing or sometimes by touching something that became infected with the virus. A vaccine for swine flu is in production.

5. Holiday Game Plan: No Weight Gain

The challenges of holiday feasting are only too obvious -- wonderful smells and fabulous tastes. We do love our comfort food! But the traditional holiday weight gain is another matter. If it's a real problem for you, here's good news. With a few simple changes, you can enjoy the feast without gaining the extra 1 to 3 pounds that tend to become permanent baggage.

Here's your plan:

Don't arrive starving. Eat something small and healthy, like oatmeal or a whole-grain sandwich, before the big meal. That will keep you full until dinner.

Exercise every day. This means big holidays, too. Get the family out with you. Start a new holiday tradition that involves activity.

Establish ground rules with yourself. Eat dessert, but only a sliver, for example.

Keep track. Write down everything you eat. If you put it in writing, you're less tempted to overeat.

Eat smaller portions of high-calorie dishes. Enjoy, but don't pig out.

Save calories for the foods you love. Don't eat something just because it's there.

Chat more, eat less. Shun those high-fat appetizers at holiday parties.

If you know you'll have trouble resisting those favorite foods, plan for it. Cut back on eating early in the week. Get more exercise before and after the holidays. You can do this!

6. Sweet Potatoes: Winter Superfood

It's one of the sweetest ways to make a healthful change -- get hot about sweet potatoes. These luscious orange tubers boast a wealth of antioxidants; phytochemicals including beta-carotene; vitamins C and E; folate; calcium; copper; iron; and potassium. The fiber in sweet potatoes promotes a healthy digestive tract, and the antioxidants may play a role in preventing heart disease and cancer.

The natural sweetness of a roasted sweet potato is delicious without any additional fats or flavor enhancers.

7. Exercise Your Brain: Go Dancing

You know your heart benefits from exercise. Your brain does, too. Studies show that regular, moderate exercise -- 30 minutes of walking or a light one-mile run -- helps fight the effects of aging on the brain. No grueling workouts required!

All types of exercise count, including walking, bicycling, hiking, swimming, aerobics, and weight training. Ballroom dancing is another good one, especially fun on chilly evenings.

How does exercise work to prevent mental decline? Researchers believe exercise may stimulate the body to fight stress that's normally occurring in the brain -- stress that causes oxidative damage. All that good stuff from a little exercise!

8. Curl Up With Hot Coffee

That wonderfully warming cup of morning coffee may have health benefits. The caffeine in coffee stimulates the brain and nervous system, and may lower your risk of diabetes, Parkinson's disease, mood problems, headaches, and even cavities.

Scientists have discovered coffee's many beneficial substances, including chlorogenic acid, a compound in the antioxidant family that may improve glucose (sugar) metabolism. Another perk is that coffee contains magnesium, a mineral that can also improve insulin sensitivity and enhance glucose tolerance -- thumbs up for preventing diabetes.

Another plus is that coffee is naturally calorie-free. Just don't load it up with extra calories from cream, sugar, whipped cream, and/or flavored syrup."
248,248,"South Africa's mineral resources - some of which are supposedly reaching the end of their lifespan such as gold - may be in for a resurrection as new technologies may lead to the discovery of new deposits hitherto hidden deep underground.

Professor Susan Webb of the University of the Witwatersrand School of Geosciences said using the latest techniques in analysing so-called big data it was thought likely that previously unknown deposits of both precious and base minerals would be discovered which could place South Africa squarely back in the lead as a mining powerhouse.

It could also reveal gas and oil deposits which would be a game changer for the South African economy.

""We have tons of data which still needs to be analysed and it is likely that these datasets, as well as new data coming in from a variety of sources including satellites and ground stations, will provide us with clues as to where these deposits are located.""

The newfound sense of optimism is not limited to scientists and academics. Anglo American group director, technical and sustainability, Tony O'Neill recently told a prominent mining journal that big data was a ""low-hanging fruit just within our grasp"". ""For the first time in my 36-year career in mining, I feel we're on the cusp of an explosion of game-changing technology,"" he said. The opportunities presented by big data and other key technologies were enormous, he said.

Moyo Business Advisory, a Centurion firm of business consultants have played a major role in introducing new technologies for the processing and analysis of so-called big data in South Africa.

Dewald Lindeque, Business Development Director at Moyo Business Advisory, said his company had devised big data business solutions for some of the largest companies in South Africa that had in many respects revolutionised the way they do business.

""The amazing thing with big data is that you can accurately predict events that have not yet happened and devise plans on how to capitalise on those events. It can be applied to everything ranging from the discovery of new mineral resources to the streamlining of business processes in the corporate sector.

""It has also been used with great success in the scientific field in the development of new drugs such as a procedure to modify T cells in the human genome to fight leukaemia as well as in the decoding of the human genome to help fight genetic diseases.""

The latest addition to their family of products is a system that uses computer graphics cards and specialised database management software rather than ever larger and more expensive computers to process and analyse big data.

""Through our partnership with SQream Technologies in Israel, we have shown the enormous potential of big data in the business, mining, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and retail sectors. It also has enormous potential in the scientific field such as processing the vast amount of data generated in the field of cancer research and in the search for new life-saving drugs.

Lindeque said the importance of computing on this massive scale was vitally important for the corporate world where big data had been earmarked as the next great leap forward to help the business community to maximise profits and reduce costs by effectively using information companies already had resident on their databases.

Using big data, scientists have already discovered new mineral deposits and the technology could be widely applied to exploration, they wrote in the journal American Mineralogist.

""Big data points to new minerals, new deposits,"" they wrote of the findings.

A scientific paper published in the American Mineralogist recently proved beyond doubt that big data could find new mineral deposits.

""The quest for new mineral deposits is incessant, but until recently mineral discovery has been more a matter of luck than scientific prediction,"" said co-author Dr Shaunna Morrison of the Deep Carbon Observatory and the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington.

249,249,"THE infertility crisis at the heart of the recently televised The Handmaid's Tale is the reason why Gilead's founders staged a coup, overthrowing democracy and reclaiming fertile women, like Elizabeth Moss' character Offred, as state property.

Channel 4's dramatisation of Margaret Attwood's dystopian novel got rave reviews and drew large audiences. But new research suggests that by linking infertility to environmental issues, the near-futuristic series may too far-fetched after all.

Men's sperm counts have fallen by almost 60% since the 1970s, according to major new research which cautions that our modern world may be prompting a male fertility crisis.

Over the past few years, various studies have pointed to declining sperm quality and quantity. This latest research, and the first systematic review of trends, looked at 180 studies over four decades.

It concluded that total sperm counts in Western countries have fallen by 59% since 1973, with a 52% fall in sperm concentration, or the concentration of sperm in a man's ejaculate.

""Decreasing sperm count has been of great concern since it was first reported 25 years ago,"" says Dr Shanna H Swan, a professor in the Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York and study leader.

""This definitive study shows, for the first time, that this decline is strong and continuing. The fact that the decline is seen in Western countries strongly suggests that chemicals in commerce are playing a causal role in this trend.""

The chemicals he refers to range from everyday air pollutants to pesticides or even soap. So should the average man panic?

A first glance at the statistics suggests that we are faring well. Ireland had the highest birth rate among EU countries last year. 2016 saw 63,900 live births recorded according to figures from Eurostat, the EU statistics agency. That's a super healthy rate of 13.5 births for every 1,000 of the population. Italy was the lowest with just 7.8 births for 1,000 of the population.

However, male infertility is a factor for half of the couples who seek fertility treatment here in Ireland. Azoospermia (absence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate) is a condition present in approximately 1% of males in the general population.

Between 10-15% of infertile men who attend assisted reproductive technology clinics here have had a diagnosis of azoospermia. However, approximately 30% of couples present where there is suboptimal sperm count or reduced motility, impacting on the couples' ability to conceive a child.

Tom, 41, is currently undergoing fertility treatment. ""There's less pressure on men when it comes to fertility. We see the likes of Ronnie Wood, still having babies in his seventies. I'd assumed that everything would be grand,"" he says.

""My wife and I wanted to start a family, but after trying for almost two years, we went for fertility testing. The results showed that I have a low sperm count as well as poor motility and morphology, meaning that the sperm doesn't swim well and are not the ideal shape. We are very unlikely to be able to conceive naturally.""

""I was devastated when we first got the news. I felt like I was letting my wife down and couldn't give her the baby she wanted. Now my wife has to have IVF treatment, even though she doesn't have a fertility problem herself. Our first treatment failed unfortunately but we're hopeful and about to try round two.""

Dr Bart Kuczera, a consultant with Beacon Care Fertility, thinks that while we need to adopt a commonsense approach to the study's results, environmental pollution is of major concern to everyone's individual health, not to mention the cost in terms of healthcare bills and its contribution to declining fertility.

There's increasing evidence that even the more mundane types of pollution, like car exhaust fumes and household cleaning products, can impact on our fertility. A 2016 University of Barcelona study concluded that outdoor air pollution affects at least one of the four semen quality parameters included in the review.

""From the food we consume to the cosmetics we use and the air we breathe we are enveloped in endocrine disruptive chemicals (such as pesticides in our fruit and vegetables) and disturbing levels of 'particulate matter air pollution' [particularly that from traffic and industrial sites],"" says Dr Kuczera. ""That said, this study shines a spotlight on the issue of declining male fertility and provides men with the information they need to make the necessary changes in their lifestyle and environment.

""We can be mindful of air pollution and live in a clean environment where possible, consuming food free from pesticides and avoiding contact with any chemicals in the environment or in the products we use,"" he says.

Dr Tim Dineen, head of laboratory services at Cork's Waterstone Clinic, says the study draws attention to a trend that doctors and scientists working in reproductive medicine have been aware of for many years.

""The decline in sperm counts is very gradual and is unlikely to prevent any individual man fathering children naturally in the short term,"" says Dr Dineen.

""It is also important to point out that if a man's sperm count is so low that natural conception is impossible, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment is able to compensate for the problem very successfully.""

Treatments, in the form of ICSI, have been very successful in overcoming male subfertility and male infertility. In the Waterstone Clinic, for those couples where the female partner is younger with good ovarian reserve, a live birth rate of at least 50% (first fresh cycle) is expected.

ICSI costs €4,750 including blastocyst and embryoscope incubator culture at the clinic, which offers a range of treatments.

""It is reasonable to assume that environmental factors are to blame but no one knows exactly which factors are involved,"" says Dr Dineen. ""Research is urgently required to identify the environmental causes; only then can public health initiatives be undertaken in order to address the problem.""

ANXIETY and stress may contribute to male infertility due to hormonal imbalances. ""This needs further research,"" he adds. ""Whatever a man can do to alleviate his stress can only be beneficial, not only when trying to conceive naturally, but also following a diagnosis of infertility and as he embarks on IVF treatment.""

There is a wide range of treatment options available to infertile men. ""If the patient has a low sperm count this can be stimulated for two to three months, provided that the patient's hormonal profile is adequate. However, more often than not assisted reproduction treatment is the most suitable option,"" says Dr Kuczera.

""The first line of treatment is intrauterine inseminations, where sperm is washed and concentrated prior to being placed inside the female partner's uterus to facilitate fertilisation. The goal of IUI is to increase the number of sperm that reach the fallopian tubes and subsequently increase the chance of fertilisation. At the same time, we stimulate ovulation and monitor the female partner's cycle to maximise the chance of success.

""Alternatively, IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection can be offered. This is the best approach for most men who suffer from fertility issues and who have with their partners tried unsuccessfully to conceive for more than two years.

""Some couples adopt a wait and see approach but this is a much riskier option given that fertility declines with age for both men and women. Finally, the last option might be sperm donation.""

Age is also a factor. A study earlier this year by Harvard University found that men do have a biological clock and their fertility declines with age. The study found that women under 30 with a male partner aged 40 to 42 saw their chance of live birth after IVF fall to 46% in comparison with 73% for men aged 30 to 35.

With an eye on the future, Dr Dineen maintains that if the exact cause of the drop in sperm counts is not discovered and corrected soon, the decline will continue and major problems will arise with regard to the ability of men to father children naturally.

""It is possible that other associated male health problems, such as testicular cancer, due to pollutants and poor lifestyle could become much more common too, so it is imperative that research is funded and commenced immediately in order to address this major public health issue.""

How to optimise sperm quality

Dr Tim Dineen, of the Waterstone Clinic, offers the following advice on how men can optimise sperm quality:

Avoid overheating of the testicles caused by tight jeans or Lycra cycling shorts, frequent hot baths or showers, and the positioning of laptop computers in proximity to the testicles.

Avoid an excessive amount of animal fat and protein.

Maintain a diet rich in foods that contain zinc, selenium, folic acid and vitamin D, such as dark-green leafy vegetables, oily fish, and nuts.

n A man should seek an early fertility assessment when there is a history of undescended testes or surgery to correct it (orchidopexy), trauma to the groin area, or a history of mumps orchitis."
250,250,"Liberty University presents itself as a temple of virtue. But its founding family's secret Miami hostel is a cesspool of vice.

""It's actually that one,"" our Uber driver said, pointing with one hand and shifting into reverse with the other. ""Right here?"" I asked, thinking he must've gotten the address wrong. All I saw was a liquor store.

""That's it,"" he said, crawling to a stop. Miami Hostel, 810 Alton Road, a dilapidated boarding house quietly hidden behind non-descript storefronts.

Story Continued Below

The trunk opened, and as my partner, Andy, pulled out our luggage, I took a deep breath and surveyed my temporary home away from home. This building in front of me, nestled quietly in a relatively rundown stretch of South Beach, contained three different businesses: an Italian restaurant, a liquor store and a hostel.

As the Uber pulled away, Andy stood, slowly shaking his head. What had I gotten him into? ""It's probably not as terrible as it looks,"" I told him. ""Let's go.""

The first thing I noticed was the almost eye-level gray gate with an odd, oval sign declaring that the hostel was -- for lack of a better term -- a safe space.

""That's weird, right?"" Andy chuckled and opened the door. By then, he and I already knew, thanks to a tipster that the owner of the Miami Hostel was none other than Jerry Falwell III, better known as Trey, who purchased the property with financial help from his father, Jerry Falwell Jr., a man who pretty much embodies everything on that sign: the fusion of religion with politics, aggressive fundraising and a slick, salesman-like approach to public faith. It was Falwell Jr. whose early endorsement of Donald Trump in the 2016 primaries -- he hailed him for living ""a life of loving and helping others as Jesus taught in the great commandment"" -- was seen as pivotal in helping Trump secure the evangelical vote.

At Liberty University, the Christian private school at which Falwell Jr. is the president and Trey is the vice president for university operations -- and from which I graduated in 2011 -- all manner of vice is prohibited. Students, whether on campus or off, and whether school is in session or not -- cannot consume alcohol or tobacco. Co-ed sleeping arrangements are verboten. And, in the words of ""The Liberty Way,"" the school's student handbook, ""homosexual conduct or the encouragement or advocacy of any form of sexual behavior that would undermine the Christian identity or faith mission of the University"" are strictly prohibited. Any one of these transgressions could get you saddled with reprimands, financial repercussions, and even expulsion. And yet, here we were, in perhaps the gayest 6 square miles in the United States -- South Beach, Miami -- staying in Falwell's gay-friendly flophouse with an on-site liquor store.

At least that's the story I thought I was there to report. The more I dug into it, the larger and more byzantine the story became -- and the more questions it raised. Though Liberty University officials declined to comment on the record for this story, senior-level sources at the university agreed to answer many of my questions. But rather than settling the matter, the answers they provided begat new and more serious inquiries that go beyond mere charges of hypocrisy over owning a hostel, and point to dubious behavior by Liberty University -- actions which, according to several tax-law experts I consulted, could violate IRS rules.

***

Last fall, I set out to write a story for POLITICO Magazine about the internal disagreements at Liberty University over Falwell Jr.'s enthusiastic public support for Trump. When I interviewed the university chancellor for the piece, Trey tagged along. It seemed clear that he was being groomed to carry the torch after his father hands it off to him -- just as Falwell Jr., inherited his post from Falwell Sr.

As I reported the piece, it became apparent that at the core of what initially appeared to be a simple political divide over Trump was instead a more consequential dynamic: frustration over real or perceived double standards.

At Liberty, any faculty member who wishes to speak to a journalist must involve President Falwell's office either before any contact takes place or within three hours of it ending. The reason for this policy, Liberty's lead counsel, David Corry, told me, has to do with the school's closely guarded nonprofit status: To keep its tax exemption, Liberty is prohibited from taking a political position or endorsing a particular candidate.

The only person who can speak on record without having to ask for approval is Falwell himself, who in 2016 endorsed Trump during the Republican primary, just ahead of the Iowa caucuses. Falwell has maintained that his endorsement was as a private citizen and is no reflection of his relationship with the school. But it's tough to square that with the fact that Falwell was introduced at the 2016 Republican National Convention as the president of Liberty University, or that he touted his experiences running Liberty in explaining his support for Trump. As one Liberty faculty member put it to me, Falwell ""would not have the public platform to speak as he does without the university.""

Falwell voices his political opinions freely, while faculty members -- all of whom work without the protections of tenure -- are unable to do so. Far from protecting Liberty's reputation as a nonpartisan institution, the lack of public dissenting voices from faculty members means that when Falwell makes a political comment, he is seen to be speaking on behalf of the university, as if the two are one and the same.

A few months after my first POLITICO story published, an anonymous reader emailed me with a tip about the hostel, angry over what they viewed as Falwell's hypocrisy. ""Why does Falwell need to own an LGBT-friendly hostel?"" this person wrote.

For the university's students, staff and faculty, ""The Liberty Way"" is the law of the land -- outlining in granular detail how they are expected to behave, act, speak and dress. (Faculty have their own handbook, but it says in boldface type that they are to conduct themselves in a manner ""compatible with the Mission of the University and 'The Liberty Way.'"") Its premise is that every person associated with the university ""should avoid any activity, on or off campus, which would contradict the university's mission or purpose, compromise the testimony or reputation of the university.""

If caught in violation of the Liberty Way, you face dire consequences, including expulsion for students or termination for faculty and staff. Unless, it seems, your last name is Falwell.

The Falwell-owned hostel encourages behavior that would get Liberty students expelled -- the drinking, the smoking, the advertising for strip clubs, the free shuttles to local bars, the possibility of co-ed sleeping arrangements, and so on. And they certainly wouldn't be allowed to buy anything from the adjoining liquor store on Falwell's property -- an amenity the hostel touts in the self-description it provides to travel sites like TripAdvisor: ""There is a liquor store connected to the hostel with almost anything you need for partying!""

For most people, this probably seems like no big deal. But there's a more substantive concern here than simple hypocrisy: For two years, the Falwell-controlled LLC that owned the hostel (as well as the land containing the liquor store and neighboring Italian restaurant) was based on property in Virginia owned by Liberty University.

The hostel is at 810 Alton Road in Miami Beach, on the same parcel of land housing Miami Beach Liquors and Macchialina, a better-than-average Italian restaurant. Documents with the Miami-Dade County Recorder show that on February 21, 2013, that parcel was purchased by Alton Hostel LLC for $4.65 million. At the time, the LLC -- which had formed just two weeks earlier, on February 7, 2013 -- listed Trey Falwell, then 23, as the sole manager of the company. A high-ranking Liberty University source with extensive knowledge of the deal confirmed to POLITICO Magazine that Jerry Falwell gave his son money for the $4.65 million purchase. The same source maintains that the elder Falwell has no business dealings with the property -- which may be true, but a May 21 Facebook post shows that Jerry Falwell and his wife, Becki, dined at Macchialina with Giancarlo Granda, Trey's business partner in the hostel's LLC.

In its February 2013 articles of organization in Florida, Alton Hostel LLC listed 3200 Sunnymeade Road in Rustburg, Virginia, as its mailing address. According to records filed with the county of Campbell, Virginia, the Sunnymeade property, which is 21 acres in size and includes a three-bedroom house, is currently owned by Trey Falwell and his wife. But at the time of the LLC's formation in 2013, the property was owned by Liberty University -- Trey Falwell and his wife were renting the house from Liberty for $600 a month, according to a high-ranking source who works for the school. The university continued to own the property until it was sold to Trey Falwell in May 2015 for $225,000. Speaking on background, sources at Liberty University told POLITICO Magazine that this price was fair-market value, and was assessed as such by a neutral third party.

While it is possible for a nonprofit such as Liberty University to engage in financial transactions with a senior officer or close family member of a senior officer, a number of legal limitations and restrictions apply, according to Lloyd Mayer, a professor at University of Notre Dame Law School who specializes in taxation and nonprofit law. The most obvious regulation involves the nonprofit disclosing that the sale took place -- which, in this case, did not happen.

Speaking on background with POLITICO Magazine, a senior Liberty University official claimed that the disclosure was unnecessary because it did not result in an ""excess benefit transaction."" But instructions from IRS Form 990 say otherwise: Any ""business transactions"" that exceeded $100,000 during the tax year had to be reported if they were with an ""interested person."" According to legal experts consulted by POLITICO Magazine, Trey Falwell -- who is Liberty University's vice president of university operations in addition to being the son of the school's president and grandson of its founder -- would surely count as an interested person.

Members of Liberty University's legal team declined to speak on the record with POLITICO Magazine. In an email exchange made on the condition of anonymity, one senior university official familiar with the matter stated that the university does not find that the single sale of a home under these circumstances amounts to a business transaction. Instead, the university sees it as a ""one-time personal transaction."" When asked to explain the difference, this official said that was ""a fact-specific question dependent on many things."" Responding to repeated requests for clarification, Liberty University officials refused to answer this question on the record.

Several tax experts say the distinction Liberty has offered is not supported by IRS instructions.

""It's bullshit,"" says Eve Borenstein, an attorney and recognized expert on nonprofit tax law who is sometimes known as the ""Queen of the 990,"" as she was introduced before giving testimony at a congressional hearing in 2012. Borenstein says Liberty does not get to decide whether the sale of land to Trey Falwell constitutes a business transaction that needs to be disclosed: ""That would moot the whole point of the schedule.""

According to the 2014 instructions for Schedule L, ""business transactions,"" which include ""contracts for sale,"" that exceeded $100,000 during the tax year have to be reported if they are with an ""interested person."" Further, Mayer clarifies, ""a transaction does not have to be part of operating a business or obtaining services for it to be reportable.""

Borenstein says that Liberty officials' use of the word ""personal"" offends her, because the school is ""suggesting that they could be doing something personally with their money that I don't have a right to inquire about."" The point of these tax filings, she says, are to expose these kinds of insider transactions to the court of public opinion. ""The whole reason for the disclosure is so that people have the opportunity to say, 'Falwell sold something to his kid -- did he do it right?'""

The university says it followed protocol by having its board of trustees vote to approve the sale -- a vote ahead of which Jerry Falwell excused himself from the room, university officials tell POLITICO Magazine. But a brief look into the board's history suggests that the board, not unlike the faculty, serves largely at the whims of Jerry Falwell. For example, last year, Mark DeMoss, a Liberty alum, longtime board member and chair of its executive committee -- a man whose dedication to Evangelical Christianity is beyond reproach, as evinced by his years of service to the late Rev. Jerry Falwell, whom he likened to a ""second father"" and for whom he served as chief of staff -- was pushed off Liberty's board after he voiced his disagreement with Falwell's endorsement of Trump to the Washington Post. Trump, said DeMoss, does not represent the ""Christ-like behavior that Liberty has spent 40 years promoting with its students."" Falwell quickly accused DeMoss -- the son of the Liberty benefactor whose name graces DeMoss hall, the main building on campus -- of being, in DeMoss' words, the disloyal ""political pawn of a rival campaign."" He was gone about a month later.

Perhaps DeMoss is an exception, but his ordeal does suggest that board members, like faculty members who wish to give media interviews, don't enjoy complete freedom to disagree with Falwell. And in such an environment, the interests of the Falwells and those of Liberty University cannot help but to blur.

""This scenario just feels wrong,"" says Kimberly Reeve, an associate professor of business at King's College and an expert in nonprofit management. She notes that Liberty is in a unique situation: It's a huge nonprofit organization with significant real estate holdings. For Reeve, the primary question ""should be whether or not the sale of this property was in the best interest of the university and helped it fulfill its mission. If questioned, the university should be able to indicate exactly how this sale did that."" Otherwise, such a land sale would suggest that the university was not acting primarily in its own best interests, but instead, acting to the benefit of other parties.

There's smoke,"" says Borenstein. ""The logical next question is, what else has the school left out of its tax filings?""

Asked by POLITICO Magazine how specifically this sale of land to Trey Falwell was in the best interests of Liberty University, senior university officials again refused to speak on the record. In a statement given to POLITICO Magazine with the condition that it not be attributed, one top Liberty official explained that ""the small house that Trey bought is located on the outer fringes of about 7,500 acres owned by the university"" and is located ""several miles from campus."" According to the university official, ""the board decided that [the property] had no use to the university in the fulfillment of its mission."" (As a matter of public record, the Campbell County Assessor's office shows that the university still owns the land abutting three of the four sides of Trey Falwell's Sunnymeade property, part of a sprawling Liberty-owned lot that stretches further away from campus for nearly another half-mile.)

Someone could argue that a $225,000 sale is a drop in the bucket for an institution with assets valued in the billions. But that justification misses the point, says Borenstein. ""Liberty says they did this transaction correctly, but [POLITICO Magazine] had to uncover it -- so there's smoke. And you don't know if there are other transactions to ask about. The logical next question is, 'What else has the school left out of its tax filings?'""

Inside the Falwells' hostel, the stench of general decay and cigarette smoke is overpowering. Walking to the lobby, Andy and I passed down narrow hallways as spatterings of people milled about, smoking, talking to each other, playing billiards, staring into their phones. There's an ashtray on every table -- two at the red bar, above which shone a Miller Lite sign.

As we approached the reception desk, the older of the two men behind the counter cocked his eyebrow, as if to ask us what the hell we wanted. ""We're checking in,"" Andy explained. ""Oh,"" said the younger one, his burly biceps bulging out from his tank top. ""Give us five minutes. You can go into the kitchen.""

The kitchen was also what you might call the business center: Two computers lined a wall, next to which stood a bookcase with a Bible hidden on the second-to-bottom shelf, buried amid the kind of fiction your fourth-grade teacher might read at the beach. Across from the books was a wall display of Minicards advertising local entertainment and other venues for tourists and offering coupons for their business. One of them caught my eye: a closeup of a redhead with entirely too much eyeshadow, sporting a wide choker around her neck. Tootsie's Cabaret: 74,000 square feet of adult entertainment and FULL NUDITY.

I took a seat at a hightop, and tried to figure out the situation at the only other occupied table in the kitchen. A guy and girl were seated across from each other. The girl stared blankly at the guy, who was very angry at whomever he was on the phone with. I couldn't understand anything he said except a few shouted fucks.

Andy grimaced at the stench of the room. ""I have to breathe through my mouth,"" he said quietly, before heading back to the lobby to check in. Minutes later, he returned holding two frayed towels and a folded pile of formerly white bedding. The employees had advised him that we should go to CVS and buy locks to keep our belongings secure while we slept. There'd been thefts, and management took pains to remind us that they weren't responsible for what happened to our stuff. ""Seriously, Brandon, there's a Hyatt just up the street,"" Andy said.

We made the way to our room, climbing up a narrow green staircase and passing through a hallway straight out of a slasher film -- long and narrow, with a dim light flickering at the end of it.

As soon as we unlocked the door, I smelled incense, which masked the unmistakable scent of marijuana. Two guys were conversing in Spanish, while another sat on a lower bunk fidgeting with his fishing rod. Everyone quickly, almost imperceptibly acknowledged us, and we returned the greeting. There were six bunks, two of which were reserved for us. Andy took one top bunk and I threw my stuff on the only other open top bunk, in the opposite corner of the room.

I introduced myself to the stranger who'd be sleeping 3 feet below me. ""Hi, I'm Brandon.""

""Alejandro."" He extended a hand. He said he'd been here for a few days and usually stays here when he's in the area -- he travels a lot, picking up one-off construction jobs. ""My home is everywhere and nowhere."" Last week he was in Cuba, which he guaranteed I'd love.

""Just go now,"" he said, ""before your ... Trump."" He rolled his eyes as he said the name, with more derision than scorn. Alejandro took a quick peek around and then pulled his suitcase out from underneath his bunk. ""I want to show you something.""

He pulled out a T-shirt featuring a caricature of the president, surrounded by the words Fuck El Payaso.

""Do you know what it means?"" he asked, wearing a huge grin. ""Means clown! Your president! I got it in Mexico -- it's how they call him there.""

In January 2016, when Falwell hosted a speech in Iowa by then-candidate Trump, he engaged in a bit of Trumpian self-aggrandizement, crediting his own wizardry with saving the once troubled Liberty University. ""We spent the '80s and '90s struggling to survive,"" Falwell told the audience in Davenport, referring to the school's past near bankruptcy and $100 million debt. ""One of the things that attracted me to Donald Trump is that I see our country at a stage now where we're approaching $20 trillion in debt, and it reminds me of where Liberty University was in the 1990s,"" he said before endorsing the candidate for president.

When Trump came onstage, he returned the favor. ""The job Jerry's done at Liberty University is amazing,"" Trump said. ""One of the things I noticed the other day looking over numbers ... looking at different colleges, and you're one of the most financially solid, financially sound universities in the entire United States, with a tremendous endowment and tremendous amounts of money,"" Trump proclaimed. ""You don't have debt."" (Falwell responded to Trump's flattery with a caveat: ""That's why I have to make it clear that it's not Liberty's endorsement, it's my personal endorsement -- because the IRS would love to get their hands on that, too."")

Liberty University may not have debt, but its students and graduates do. A lot of it. And that's how the school -- and the Falwells -- made their money.

Liberty bills itself as the world's largest Christian university -- and that's true. But once you start breaking down its numbers, as Kevin Carey recently did for the New York Times, a much more complicated picture emerges of a place that sells itself as an educational Eden.

""Liberty is essentially a medium-size nonprofit college that owns a huge for-profit college,"" Carey wrote. Although Falwell boasts that his school has tens of thousands of students, his residential program has only 14,000, a small fraction of the overall figure. Liberty's online program has about 64,000, nearly four times as many, making it second only to the University of Phoenix in terms of the size of its online student body. On paper, the only difference between the two online schools is that Liberty's is tax-exempt. In 2015, it received $345 million from federal undergraduate grant and loan programs -- more than twice the amount received by the largest public university in the country. ""Liberty's considerable financial success -- it has built a $1 billion cash reserve, and Mr. Falwell is paid more than $900,000 a year,"" Carey wrote, ""was underwritten largely by the federal taxpayer."" That money has blessed the Falwells with a life of considerable plenty, giving them the financial means to, among other things, purchase a $4.65 million property in Miami Beach. (A university spokesperson disputes that characterization but repeatedly refused to speak on the record about the matter.)

Liberty University may not have debt, but its students and graduates do. A lot of it. And that's how the school -- and the Falwells -- made their money.

Some of the federal funds Liberty students receive pay for an education that is not only explicitly religious education, but which requires proselytizing. At Liberty, perhaps the two most controversial examples of this are the school's Creation Studies 290 and Evangelism 101 courses.

According to Liberty's website, the purpose of the university's Center for Creation Studies is to ""research, promote, and communicate a robust young-Earth creationist view of Earth history. Beginning with sound biblical interpretation, we seek to understand how science can inform us about God's magnificent creation."" The Center operates Creation Hall, which boasts fossilized bones from an Allosaurus, which according to young-Earth science, are 6,000 to 10,000 years old -- as old as literally everything else in the universe.

At the 2010 dedication of Creation Hall, Rev. Jonathan Falwell, Jerry, Jr.'s brother and the pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church, hailed the exhibit as an opportunity for Christians to ""stand up for the truth."" Liberty University, he promised, ""will always hold to the truth accounted in Genesis."" That probably explains why the course was a graduation requirement from at least 2004, when I began as a student there, until the 2016-2017 school year, when it was no longer required for certain degree programs.

Evangelism 101, on the other hand, continues to be a graduation requirement for residential Liberty students. The very first line of the course syllabus describes it as ""an in-depth study of how to lead people to Christ."" The course rationale is even more clear: ""This course was designed in obedience to the biblical mandate supported by Liberty University to evangelize the lost. Its purpose is to train the student to evangelize and to equip others for evangelism in today's culture."" To pass the course, students are required to write a ""witness report,"" a two-page paper that documents a ""face-to-face encounter"" they have with one ""unbeliever"" to whom they evangelize. (I imagine the Miami Hostel would provide ample opportunity for this kind of proselytization, if only its owners allowed it on property.) If you're a non-believer, you're still required to take the course, but can opt for a slightly different path: ""If not a Christian, the student will instead write a paper of the same length for equal grading consideration explaining why he or she is not a Christian and elaborating on the teachings presented in the course.""

There's little doubt that Liberty's intent in requiring these courses is idealistic, as I well know from attending the university for my undergraduate degree. The school is, after all, premised on the fervent shared beliefs of all those in its orbit. But some employers seem to not think much of it -- which may be why so many students have a hard time landing decent salaried jobs and paying back their loans. Within three years of graduating from Liberty University, almost 10 percent of students default on their loans, well above the national average of 6.5 percent among recent graduates of private nonprofit four-year colleges (its default rate is nonetheless slightly lower than the national average graduates of all colleges, profit and nonprofit). While most don't default, many make almost no effort to reduce their balances, says Carey, who notes that ""only 38 percent of Liberty borrowers manage to pay down as little as one dollar on their student loan principal within three years of leaving school.""

Were Liberty a for-profit school, it would have to note its lousy loan repayment rates on its promotional material, thanks to borrower protections put into place during the Obama administration. It's not unlike a lung cancer warning on cigarette packaging, says Carey: ""U.S. Department of Education Warning: A majority of recent student loan borrowers at this school are not paying down their loans.""

The rationale was that the requirement would protect students from taking on a lifetime of debt from fraudulent schools. In a March 2016 news release announcing debt relief for students defrauded by 91 campuses of Corinthian College, the Department of Education said it was committed to ""aggressive and comprehensive action to address fraudulent, illegal and abusive practices in higher education.""

Last January, Falwell told the Chronicle of Higher Education that Trump assigned him to a task force to identify changes that should be made in the Department of Education. Among those items on his list, said Falwell, were ""overreaching regulation"" and ""borrower defense"" rules. ""I've got notebooks full of issues,"" Falwell told the Chronicle.

Undoubtedly some of these issues are ones whose repeal could help Liberty continue raking in dough. According to its tax documents, Liberty's ""primary mission"" is to provide ""quality collegiate education"" (language that no doubt satisfies federal requirements). While plenty of its residential programs fulfill this mission, some might question if the school's insanely profitable online programs provide the same educational quality. One online graduate-level religion course, for example, Strategic Prayer and Spiritual Warfare (Evangelism 670), requires students to write a 7- to 10-page final paper outlining ""a plan for growth in various aspects of his/her prayer life."" For full-time non-divinity students pursuing a master's degree online, the cost of this three-credit course is $1,695. (Divinity students, however, can take advantage of special block rate pricing of $2,750 per semester.) The core of most of Liberty's online classes is the group discussion board, in which students are expected to discuss class content. Each discussion board assignment consists of an initial 200 to 400 word thread and two 150-300 word replies to two other threads; many do not require students to use sources. These discussions constitute a large portion of a student's final grade. (In Torts Law (JURI 560), for example, students of Liberty's online law school can earn three times as many points for their discussion board participation than their semester-capping ""Biblical Torts Research Paper."")

With this in mind, it's not a stretch to view Liberty's online business model -- which saved the school from ruin and brings in most of its profit -- as something of a slumlord scenario: Keep costs low, bring in struggling customers looking for a bargain, and give them a low-quality product. Not unlike the Falwells' Miami hostel.

When questioned about the quality of Liberty's online education offerings, university officials declined to speak on the record with POLITICO Magazine. In an email sent on the condition of anonymity, a Liberty spokesperson said that the school had just received a 10-year accreditation renewal ""after an exhaustive review by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools[,] ... a tough regional accreditor that requires Liberty to meet the same academic standards regardless of the method of course delivery."" The official also said that educational outcomes are best measured by Liberty's students, and as evidence, referred POLITICO Magazine to a page on the school's website titled ""What Alumni Say,"" featuring positive testimonials by select alumni.

Other graduates have a decidedly different view of not only the quality of a Liberty education, but the moral character of the school's leadership.

For some alumni, displeasure with Liberty University has been growing for a while, but Chancellor Falwell's recent defense of President Trump's remarks about the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia -- there were ""very fine people on both sides,"" Trump said; ""he's not politically correct ... and that's one of the reasons I supported him,"" Falwell told Martha Raddatz on ABC News' ""This Week"" -- led them to organize a more public expression of their disapproval of Falwell.

On September 5, dozens of Liberty graduates are planning to return their diplomas to Falwell ""to protest the university's departure from its core mission and values and to communicate our strong disgust with both the chancellor, and the university that continues to employ him,"" according to a letter penned by the group. The signatories allege that by failing to disavow Trump's ""open disrespect for ostensible Christian ideals,"" Falwell has ""degraded [Liberty's] core mission and defiled its core beliefs, substituting the worship of power and influence for the worship of God. Ten years after [Rev.] Jerry Falwell's death, the decades-long criticisms of the concept of a Religious Right have been proven true.""

Calling the mail-back a ""joke"" and ""publicity stunt,"" Falwell told the Independent Journal Review, a conservative news website, that the graduates are merely ""grandstanding to gain five minutes of fame."" ""Shame on the media for even reporting,"" he said.

But for many alumni -- and, based on my previous reporting, quite a few current faculty and students -- Liberty University has come to represent what happens when religion commingles with soliciting, fundraising, politics and salesmen.

Maybe that's why those activities aren't welcome at the Miami Hostel. From experience, the Falwells know what strange bedfellows those pursuits often prove to be."

The age gap between young parents and the unencumbered at this workplace is about the same as among the bankers. Almost all the employees in their 30s are kitchen staff with kids at home, while the wait staff is made up of 20-somethings still living with roommates. When a sick babysitter means missing a shift, Luis has to negotiate a last-minute cover with the rest of the staff.

President Donald Trump's 2018 budget proposal earmarked $19 billion over the next 10 years for paid leave for new parents whose employers provide none: six weeks covered by an unspecified reform of state-level unemployment benefits and increased payroll taxes.

The introduction of a new unfunded federal mandate raises many questions, most with no ready answer. But two things are clear. One, a healthy balance between family and professional duties eludes workers at all strata of American life. It's a universal, though variously manifested, challenge most large companies, six states, dozens of cities, and every other developed nation have taken on. Second, the very presence of paid leave in the president's ""America First"" budget constituted a win for Ivanka Trump, who was the driving force behind her father's campaign promise of paid leave for new mothers.

When Ivanka Trump introduced the next president of the United States at the Republican National Convention last July, she conjured a portrait of him -- my father the feminist -- foreign even to his most loyal supporters. And she stumped on atypical topics for the biggest gathering of Republicans: the wage gap and paid family leave. ""Women represent 46 percent of the total U.S. labor force,"" she barnstormed with perfect poise. ""And 40 percent of American households have female primary breadwinners.""

Trump's campaign promise was actually less progressive than what his budget proposed in May. The new plan would extend to fathers, like Luis, and adoptive parents -- though the particulars of the coverage would be left up to each state's discretion.

Getting a price tag in the proposed budget doesn't mean a policy will count among congressional priorities. But putting paid family leave into wider consideration counts for something in Washington, and the paid-leave initiative got a standing ovation during the president's joint address to Congress in February. The first daughter has pushed a debate long-running among the city-dwelling center-left power elite onto Capitol Hill. It concerns the still-fractious concept of the ""motherhood gap,"" at the edge of which women like Jane too often exit the fast track of the white-collar world.

THE MOTHERHOOD GAP

Ivanka Trump's counterpart at the Democratic convention was Kirsten Gillibrand. ""Families today look almost nothing like they did a generation ago,"" the junior senator from New York announced. ""Eight in 10 moms work outside the home; 4 in 10 moms are the primary or sole breadwinners, and many are single. .  .  . Yet today our policies are still stuck in the Mad Men era."" The Senate's premier working mom, she noted that ""child care can cost as much as college tuition"" and that Washington is far behind the new reality in America.

The data don't lie. Both husband and wife work in 61 percent of families in which the parents are married, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Labor. Seventy percent of mothers with children under 18 were working or looking for work in 2016. Mothers' workforce participation shrinks the younger their children are: About 65 percent of mothers with children under 6 worked in 2016, but only 59 percent of mothers of infants. Tellingly, married mothers with small babies are far less likely to be looking for work than those single or divorced -- 3 percent versus 12.

Stories like Jane's help explain the gender disparity in the middle and upper rungs of top financial firms and the quickening flurry of attention every time a new study quantifies the underrepresentation of women in American corporations' C-suites -- one expression of the motherhood gap, a more accurate name for that symptom of systemic sexism often called the ""wage gap."" Economists Marianne Bertrand, Claudia Goldin, and Lawrence Katz concluded, after tracking close to 3,000 University of Chicago M.B.A.'s who graduated between 1990 and 2006, that women's earnings fall behind men's because of motherhood and the choices it foists on working moms: ""[T]he observed patterns of decreased labor supply and earnings substantially reflect women's choices given family constraints and the inflexibility of work schedules in many corporate and finance sector jobs,"" they wrote. A Harvard Business Review survey, which Sheryl Sandberg cited in her bestselling book Lean In, found that 43 percent of ""highly qualified women"" with children cease working at some point. (One can wonder if Facebook COO Sandberg, who earned her business degree at Harvard in the mid-1990s, was one of the women they surveyed.) The same survey found that just 24 percent of men similarly ""off-ramp"" from their careers -- and most of these not because of the burdens of children.

The United States stands alone among 41 economically comparable democratic nations in not mandating paid leave for new parents, according to data presented last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The U.N. reported in 2014 that only Suriname, Oman, Papua New Guinea, and a smattering of South Pacific islands joined the United States in offering new mothers no form of paid leave. (Oman has since established a 50-day paid maternity leave.) Half a dozen predominantly liberal states -- California first among them but also New Jersey, New York, Washington, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia -- and more than 30 cities (San Francisco's fully paid leave policy, for instance, surpasses the state-level offerings) have enacted paid-leave mandates, but different ones, which multistate companies struggle to meet.

Under the conveniently vague catch-all of ""pro-family policy"" are a wide variety of proposals fighting for attention on Capitol Hill. There's a confusion of goals and ideal beneficiaries that seem at cross-purposes in bills that claim a common cause -- improving the work-life balance for American families. Any autopsy of paid-leave promises would diagnose a terminal diversity of definitions, whether it's partly or fully paid, federally mandated or entirely optional but tax-incentivized and tiered. The leading Democratic proposal sets leave at 12 weeks, while IvankaCare asks only for 6. But even to consider these, in the interest of that elusive compromise, requires a common understanding of what ""paid family leave"" means -- what should it accomplish and who is it for? The answers, of course, depend on whom you ask.

FIRST DAUGHTER, WORKING MOTHER

""Politicians talk about wage equality, but my father has made it a practice at his company throughout his entire career,"" Ivanka Trump told the tens of millions watching the Republican convention. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, companies with 50 or more employees -- like the Trump Organization -- must offer 12 weeks of unpaid leave to workers with a new baby at home. But small businesses are exempt from the rule, and losing 12 weeks' wages would be an unbridgeable hardship for most new parents working for an hourly wage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just 7 percent of private-sector workers in service fields had access to paid family leave last March. Overall, 13 percent of private-sector workers had access to some form of paid leave, while 28 percent of those working in management, business, or finance had such a benefit.

Ivanka, who became an executive vice president at the Trump Organization at age 24, wants to be seen as a working mother first. She illuminated the Trump campaign's pro-family platform in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last September, calling for six weeks' of paid maternity leave. ""The current federal policies created to benefit families were written more than 65 years ago when dual-income families were not the norm,"" she wrote. ""Today, however, in about two-thirds of married couples, both spouses work,"" she added. ""Gender is no longer the factor creating the greatest wage discrepancy in this country, motherhood is.""

The transferability of a billionaire's daughter's situation is a difficult premise for any political argument. Ivanka knows she's not the natural target for paid-leave proposals, says Angela Rachidi, who studies poverty at the American Enterprise Institute: ""The people who are the ones being forced to go back to work when their babies are a week old, it's not Ivanka Trump's friends, and it wasn't me and people like me. We figured out a way to make it work. It's really the low-wage, low-skilled workers who don't have a lot of options."" Rachidi was a member of a joint AEI-Brookings Institution working group that in June produced a plan calling for eight weeks of job-protected leave for all new parents -- mothers, fathers, adoptive, biological. They would receive 70 percent of their pay, up to $600 per week, in a revenue-neutral proposal covered by an increased payroll tax on employees and equal cuts in federal spending. Ivanka previewed the plan before its publication and reportedly ""loved it.""

Abby McCloskey was another member of the working group. An economist, political consultant, and leading conservative advocate for paid family leave, she was pregnant during the 2016 presidential primaries while working as a policy adviser for Texas's Rick Perry -- who dropped out of the race just at the tail end of her two-month paid maternity leave from the campaign. Republicans, she says, are ""pro-life, pro-family, pro-opportunity,"" and they face a values test with the issue of paid leave. ""If they don't move on this, I think it will be an obvious sign, and it's not just that they didn't like the Democrats' proposal or it was impossible to come to a compromise,"" says McCloskey, an expectant mother once again. ""This is an issue that is central to what the party says it values."" Republicans, she adds, will have ""no one else to blame if this doesn't pass, so that's a really heavy burden and a crucial test.""

As younger lawmakers inherit the GOP, the Eisenhower-era ideal of household roles fades further from memory and new types of pro-family policy are gaining ground. McCloskey perceives ""more appetite for this policy among younger politicians, and certainly among women politicians who have experienced firsthand having a child and breastfeeding."" Marco Rubio, she notes, is a 46-year-old father of four. ""I think the reason why he would propose a plan, and why Ivanka Trump in her mid-30s would make it her focus, is that people who have first-hand experience [of the modern family] are going to be the biggest advocates.""

""While the public policy process is messy and slow,"" says Jane Waldfogel, a professor of social work at Columbia, ""the ground is softening on paid leave."" In a poll by the National Partnership for Women and Families around the time of the election, 82 percent of voters agreed that Congress and the new president should explore paid family leave and 78 percent that they would like a ""national paid family and medical leave fund"" to foot the bill for 12 weeks off when life overtakes work. What exactly that legislative exploration would look like -- and how it would be funded -- will be for Congress to decide.

THE TAX CREDIT TWO-STEP

Early in her father's presidency, Ivanka Trump summoned the Republican women of Congress to the White House to talk about paths ahead for child-care and paid-leave policies. But the likelier a proposal is to succeed on the Hill, the less it looks like Ivanka's ideal of paid parental leave. In the weeks after her plan got that federal price tag -- $19 billion over 10 years, from state-level reallocations -- the Trump administration (in which Ivanka is a senior adviser to the president) considered a conservative alternative. On June 20, the first daughter and nine Republican congressmen sat around a table at the invitation of Marco Rubio and talked ""pro-family tax policy."" The Florida senator had approvingly retweeted Ivanka's praise of the AEI-Brookings report. ""In America, no family should be forced to put off having children due to economic insecurity,"" Rubio wrote on June 6. ""@‌IvankaTrump is doing important work.""

Yet his fellow Republicans aren't buying. Arizona senator Jeff Flake, a Trump critic, said that no proposal that levied a new payroll tax would be ""seriously considered"" by their conference. Roy Blunt of Missouri, who chairs the Senate subcommittee in charge of budgeting the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, tells me that paid leave, while ""a good idea"" in theory, isn't in Republicans' plans. Programs to fund research into mental health and opioid abuse treatment ""will continue to be priorities that will likely take precedence over a new unfunded issue like paid family leave,"" he says. And the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin Hatch of Utah -- who told reporters shortly after the budget's release that he supports paid leave -- equivocated in a prepared statement: ""While this is a worthy goal, there are a variety of ways it can be achieved.""

The following week, Senate conservatives had a plan to push the White House their way -- toward a preexisting tax credit proposal that targets families with children under 5 and does not require parents to prove they are employed. The subject line of a June 13 email from Rubio to Republican lawmakers invited them to a ""Meeting with Ivanka Trump on Child Tax Credit,"" signaling his and Utah senator Mike Lee's intention to sell the first daughter on their modest substitute, one they'd included two years prior in a joint tax proposal that failed. The Lee-Rubio plan expands the existing child tax credit to give parents with children not yet in school $2,500 per child, per year -- a $1,500 increase on the $1,000 credit already enshrined in the tax code.

In the June 20 meeting, Ivanka heard multiple policy proposals. ""She was an active listener,"" says Nebraska senator Deb Fischer, whose Strong Families Act -- a tax credit to reward employers for offering up to 12 weeks of paid family leave -- remains the only recent bill of its kind to be introduced by a Republican. Fischer's mind is on working-class Americans, those without a safety net to fall back on. ""I think we do have a consensus, Ivanka and I, that this is the group we need to target."" She has high hopes for the presidential embrace of paid leave, because as she says of her own legislation, ""It's been kind of tough to get it moved.""

Republicans have a long record of substituting tax credits for paternalistic social policies. In 1971, Richard Nixon vetoed a bipartisan child-care subsidy at adviser Patrick Buchanan's urging. But five years later, Gerald Ford enacted an alternative that was less challenging to traditional mores: a dependent and child-care tax credit, which George H. W. Bush later expanded into a direct subsidy to help parents make ends meet.

""I think it's great!"" says Abby McCloskey, when I ask her about the Rubio-Lee tax credit seeming like a surer thing than paid leave as proposed. ""It's less targeted,"" she adds, pointing out that while it lacks the economic benefits of paid leave, it gives parents flexibility. The child tax credit expansion is expected to lead a ""pro-family"" package in Republicans' tax reform plan this fall. And even if tax reform falls through, we may well see a standalone child tax credit bill.

Angela Rachidi is more critical than McCloskey of conservative senators' desire to substitute tax credits for paid leave. ""There are reasons to expand the CTC,"" she concedes, ""but there are really no good arguments to make it a substitute for these other policies that are needed. It's a mistake."" In her view, Rubio and Lee's proposed raising of the credit to $2,500 per year means little to the low-wage worker who takes six weeks of leave at a loss of $2,100. ""It runs a risk of being a new federal expenditure that's not going to have very meaningful results,"" she tells me.

WOMEN WHO WORK -- ON CAPITOL HILL

Both Deb Fischer and Kirsten Gillibrand are pushing bills in the Senate that would give workers 12 weeks of paid leave. But there's a deep difference, one that reflects their disparate backgrounds and ideas of America.

Fischer is a moderate Republican from a western state. She raised a family first, then pursued a public career -- a degree at her state university followed by successful campaigns for local, state, and national offices. She and her husband are ranchers. The Fischer family followed a premodern model of home economics, and for as long as her three sons worked alongside their father, investment in their upbringing showed returns in their labor. Most people don't do it that way anymore. So when Fischer sells her paid-leave bill -- a 25 percent tax credit for employers who offer 12 weeks of paid leave to their workers -- to colleagues and to the press, she doesn't talk about herself. She talks about single parents waiting tables and adult children caring for infirm parents while working retail for an hourly wage to make ends meet.

Gillibrand is the junior senator from one of the most populous and powerful northeastern states. She has a banker husband, a moderately preppy pedigree -- she's a graduate of Emma Willard and Dartmouth -- and a Democratic activist grandmother whose legacy propelled her toward political office after a high-powered law career. She was in her second term in the House of Representatives in 2009 when she was picked to replace Hillary Clinton, who'd become Barack Obama's secretary of state. Gillibrand had only recently given birth to her second son. The spotlight and the timing of her pregnancy turned the first-ever breastfeeding senator from a conservative ""blue dog"" Democrat to a women's rights activist.

Both of these lady lawmakers' ideas for paid family leave cite flaws in the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) as their legislative inspiration -- unpaid leave won't help low-wage workers. Passed two weeks into Bill Clinton's presidency, the FMLA built on job-protected leave policies that had already been enacted in 34 states. It foreshadowed Clinton's ""Middle Class Bill of Rights,"" which introduced a new child tax credit four years later. Unlike President Ford's child tax credit, which can cover as much as 35 percent of care costs, the Clinton tax credit offered parents a set sum per child. In his first term, George W. Bush doubled the credit-per-child, from $500 to $1000. It is this credit that Rubio and Lee now seek to expand to $2,500. Fischer and Gillibrand welcome such an expansion, but only in addition to and not instead of passing a paid-leave bill.

Gillibrand's Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act (known as the FAMILY Act) offers a uniform 12 weeks paid leave for illness (family or personal) or the birth or adoption of a child. It would be administered through Social Security and funded by tax hikes on both employers and employees. Only about 59 percent of working women are actually eligible for unpaid leave, and the eligibility is much lower for low-income women: Department of Labor surveys have found that unpaid-leave takers' most common worry is financial loss. A mere 6 percent of employers required to provide leave under the existing law gave their workers fully paid leave as of 2016.

Gillibrand enthusiastically welcomed Ivanka Trump's advocacy of paid leave and hoped for wider Republican support. Her bill's great stumbling block since its introduction in 2013 has been its failure to catch a single conservative cosponsor. Although it boasts a lengthy roster of progressive supporters -- from Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein -- the bill has never won the approval of centrist senators like Tim Kaine, Mark Warner, or Joe Manchin. All three put their names on Deb Fischer's employer incentive plan.

When I ask Gillibrand whether she would consider a compromise on paid family leave with the White House's blessing -- and named the AEI-Brookings' eight weeks for new parents as an example -- she indulges the hypothetical only to swat it away. ""It's not what I support. It's limited and not paid for."" A staffer chimes in, ""It leaves out 75 percent of the people that our bill would cover.""

NEW PARENTS VERSUS OLD PARENTS

This figure reflects one of the complexities of paid-family leave discussions: People are often talking about apples and oranges. Would-be paid medical leave takers outnumber new parents threefold. The former group are the focus of a companion bill to Gillibrand's FAMILY Act, which has three times been introduced in the House of Representatives by Connecticut's Rosa DeLauro. Where Gillibrand reps the maternal minority, the 14-term DeLauro speaks for the growing cohort of ailing seniors in our aging nation and their grown children who need time off from work to care for them. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer while serving as chief of staff for former Connecticut senator Chris Dodd, and he provided her paid leave.

DeLauro applauds Republicans for coming around. ""It used to be just the Democrats looking at these issues,"" she tells me. ""While I believe Donald Trump's parental leave plan doesn't go far enough, I welcome him to the conversation."" ""Half measures"" -- an employer tax credit, a program for parental but not medical leave, or a refundable child-tax-credit expansion -- aren't worth the trouble, DeLauro warns, because they'll let lukewarm advocates ""check that box, and move on to the next thing.""

Deb Fischer scoffs at such reflexive opposition to a moderate answer to the universal mandates her Democratic colleagues seek to impose. She knows her bill covers nowhere near so many parents as Gillibrand's federal mandate built atop Social Security, but for her a bill inoffensive enough to pass is a win. Considering what's at stake, ""I would find it very difficult to look a single mother in the eye and say, 'Well, I didn't vote for Senator Fischer's bill so you could take a couple hours off to take your child to the doctor because it didn't go far enough.' To me that is a pretty weak excuse.""

The splash made by the Rubio-Lee plan didn't escape paid family leave's Senate Republican champion either. ""Ivanka has focused a lot on the child tax credit, as have Senator Rubio and Senator Lee,"" Fischer tells me, after running down a list of other proposals discussed at Rubio's meeting -- tax credits for home caregivers and for adoptive parents among them. To the extent that a tax credit substitution nods to stay-at-home moms, it's worth remembering that they are more common in Lee's Utah than any other state.

There's certainly a give-me-liberty tinge to Senate Republicans' nudging Ivanka to the right on the one fixed point in her legislative agenda. But conservative arguments for a comprehensive paid-leave program -- one that would increase payroll taxes and wouldn't even spare small businesses -- are rising to the fore. A set number of even partially paid weeks of leave, studies show, make new mothers far more likely to keep up regular employment. Advocates like Abby McCloskey want to make lifting these women and their children from a lifetime of welfare dependence a rallying cry for fiscal conservatives.

And the burden on small business shouldn't stand in the way of a federal mandate, former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin said during a panel discussion that marked the AEI-Brookings proposal's unveiling: ""Exempting small businesses says to me, 'Let's have a tax on growth,' "" he said -- a disincentive for employers ever to grow beyond being a small shop. And, he added, ""This isn't about the employer. It's about the kid. They are born to workers in small and large firms and we should care about them equally.""

SILICON VALLEY'S TRICKLE-DOWN EFFECT

In many ways, the market has already spoken. Silicon Valley has been host to a paid-leave arms race for years that, with flex schedules and work from home arrangements, set a social revolution in motion. In 2012, Google increased its paid leave for mothers from three to five months in response to internal findings that they'd failed to hang on to their female employees. The post-partum attrition rate halved as a result. In 2015, Netflix launched a thousand think pieces with a new policy offering paid maternity and paternity leave in the first year of a child's life, even for hourly workers. The unlimited approach allows parents to work continuously in small batches during extended time off.

""The hardest part in a woman's career is coming back after having a baby,"" says Janet van Huysse, a longtime Silicon Valley human resources manager who built Twitter's benefits package for parents from the ground up. Her first child had just turned 1 when Huysse made her return to the workforce in 2009. Nascent 100-employee, zero-revenue Twitter was offering new mothers 12 weeks' leave and fathers 6 weeks -- now, it's 20 weeks for all parents. When her second child arrived on the scene, five weeks early, Huysse worked right through her leave -- a choice she advises against. ""I use that as a cautionary tale for parents,"" who, she tells me, haven't figured out yet how much more their children need them than their company does. ""You think that you're so important, but you're not going to be doing your best work. Plus, you're never going to get this time back. Your baby's never going to be a week old again, a month old again.""

The burden of putting a leave-length value on employees with families has fallen to young and highly competitive companies like Twitter. ""It's a reflection of your talent pool,"" Huysse says, and it's an investment in retention. ""A 20-week absence is not a big deal when you're looking at someone who you want to be a part of your company.""

Tech companies, competing to retain female employees and recruit the variously gendered, know that millennials are more than twice as likely as their elders to switch jobs in search of paid leave -- as reported in Gallup's 2017 State of the American Workplace. Savvy CEOs tout their escalating generosity in a game of corporate one-upsmanship.

In early 2017, Sheryl Sandberg, who'd earlier urged women to ""lean in,"" added 20 days of bereavement leave for any Facebook employee mourning a family member and longer for caring for a sick relative. She made the announcement in a moving public letter that invoked her husband's sudden death and its toll on her young family. Facebook also offers fertility benefits -- company money to fund in vitro fertilization and egg-freezing for career women who want to wait to have kids -- and four months' leave for new mothers and fathers, matching the tech industry average. Such policies and celebrity CEOs' embrace of them are a publicity boon for these companies and help offset some of the bad publicity such corporate giants regularly incur for, say, a mishandled fake news scandal, the widespread hacking of user data, or, most commonly of late, repeat allegations of workplace harassment.

Whether employees actually use the full benefit remains a question. When they do, it's often thanks to examples from on high, Telle Whitney, president of the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology, tells me: ""Some of these younger companies, like Google and Facebook, as they started to mature and as they became bigger, created paid-leave policies that were very much appreciated by their workforce."" As their workers grew up, she explains, so did their policies. But, says Samantha Walravens, author of Torn: True Stories of Kids, Career & the Conflict of Modern Motherhood, ""If the CEO or executives are not taking their leaves, then it's sending a message to others at the company that it's not okay to take your leave."" Mark Zuckerberg, for example, is on the cusp of his second two-month paternity leave, according to a recent post on his Facebook page. Marissa Mayer sent the opposite message in 2012 when, shortly after becoming Yahoo's president and CEO while pregnant, she built a nursery off her office rather than take a full maternity leave (she took two weeks) or even work from home. Mayer banned remote work for Yahoo employees the following year.

Walravens praises one CEO friend, a notable anti-Mayer. Julia Hartz cofounded the online ticketing company Eventbrite with her husband in 2006 and had her first child in 2008, just when they were looking to hire their first employee. ""I was always on my computer in the hospital, and the nurses threatened to take the computer away and move the baby to the nursery,"" she recalled in a 2010 interview. ""I did not unplug from the business, but I did not go back to the office until I was ready. I worked from home for five months."" In the years since, she's had a second child and, in 2016, became Eventbrite's CEO. Hartz worked from home every Friday and leaned on her mother and a nanny when her first child -- and her company -- were young. She is today a vocal advocate for employees taking their leave and only easing back into work. In Walravens's words, Hartz ""walks the talk.""

So it is that the same Silicon Valley innovators whose revolution outmoded domestic tranquility have also done the best job demanding and receiving time off to take care of their families.

MAKING ENDS MEET

Unlike in the past, there is increasingly little difference between home and office. ""Today I can do most of my work from my phone -- sadly,"" says Huysse. The same conveniences that permit the plugged-in home office require parents to respond to their colleagues' emails after putting their children to bed. Our banker Jane remembers waking up in her son's room many hours after his bedtime with her phone furiously pinging in her hand. A young trader was waiting for her signoff on a client presentation.

A mother or father at home during the day is likelier than ever to be working remotely, from a laptop at the dining room table or at a standing desk in the den. Flexible scheduling, telecommuting, and family-friendly hours are common in businesses big and small, according to Lisa Horn, who lobbies Congress for the Society for Human Resource Management. Employees value the freedom to choose their hours and the availability of paid family leave almost equally in rating their benefits, according to a recent Pew survey: 28 percent cite flexible hours first, 27 percent paid leave.

The growing population of work-at-home parents toil in service to an inflated cost of living. The American middle-class family needs as many salaries as it can get today. Yet the benefits of work's encroachment into life's domain may outweigh the losses. Talented women who would, in generations past, have been cowed into the kitchen by convention are maintaining their careers. And men who'd have missed their children's fleeting early years can be present where they would have been absent without getting off the advancement track.

When they first moved to Silicon Valley in the mid-1990s, Huysse and her husband worked long hours on bulky desktop computers. Today's increasingly mobile worker has less and less need to be in the office. Sounding not unlike a Republican lawmaker extolling the virtues of a child tax credit expansion, Huysse says, ""I want everyone to be able to have the flexibility to make the right choices for themselves and their families.""

AN ISSUE WHOSE TIME HAS COME?

For now, the manifestations of a universal work-life imbalance differ widely enough that sensible people sniff at a socialite like Ivanka Trump's advocating for working women. Ever on-brand, she takes to Twitter to congratulate hedge funds that roll out revamped paid-leave packages. It's easy to say each child deserves as much nurturing as possible in his first weeks of life, regardless of where his parents work. But ""work-life balance"" and paid family leave and pro-family policy translate differently for every profession -- and from every advocate's vantage.

Regardless, it's An Issue Whose Time Has Come -- at least according to the tagline for the AEI-Brookings plan. But so said nearly everyone I talked to on the subject this summer. The time has come to talk about it, to consider what it means for American families and why more than 80 percent of them want Congress to move on the issue. We have to ask and answer how long leave should be, who'll get it, and -- the thorniest thicket of all -- who'll pay for it and, by Grover, how.

Stacey Manes, another Silicon Valley human resources pioneer who now coaches women in tech on pursuing leadership roles and competing with the dominant ""tech bros,"" tells me about her mother. ""I grew up in a household where both parents worked, and my mom definitely carried the bigger share of the laundry, cooking, and cleaning. How in the world did she do it? She worked full-time."" But, Manes realizes, it was an era with very different expectations from the one whose unceasing demands she has built her career helping hardworking men and women manage.

At first, she puzzled over her mother's superhuman ability to run a household and hold a job -- then, ""It dawned on me that she never brought her work home. She was an office manager for a dentist. The day actually ended at 5 o'clock."" And, once again with the recognition that the time has come, she says with a note of mourning, ""That's just not the world we're living in anymore."""
252,252,"Officers were found to have made 'errors and omissions' and in some instances failed to 'carry out even rudimentary investigation'

Paedophile rock star Ian Watkins could have been caught and brought to justice nearly four years earlier if police had properly investigated reports from a series of informants, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has said.

In a damning report, the IPCC details how South Wales Police missed a series of opportunities to put a stop to the Lostprophet singer's campaign of abuse against children in the years before his arrest.

Officers were found to have made ""errors and omissions"" and in some instances failed to ""carry out even rudimentary investigation"" into reports of Watkins's wrongdoing made by his ex-girlfriend Joanne Mjadzelics and other witnesses between 2008 and September 2012.

​IPCC commissioner for Wales, Jan Williams, said the investigation raised ""disturbing concerns"" about the way the reports, which she said were subject to conscious or unconscious bias, had been handled.

Watkins was jailed for 29 years in December 2013 with a further six years on licence, after admitting a string of sex offences, including the attempted rape of a fan's baby.

The disgraced singer was arrested following the execution of a drugs warrant at his Pontypridd home on September 21 2012 when a large number of computers, mobile phones and storage devices were seized.

Analysis of the equipment uncovered Watkins depraved behaviour.

Ms Mjadzelics first reported Watkins to the authorities in December 2008 and was video interviewed in March 2009 when she told officers she had a message on her mobile phone from Watkins about his desire to sexually abuse children.

The report says the phone was not examined ""on the basis that her report was malicious"".

It goes on: ""It would have been found to hold a message Ian Watkins sent to Ms Mjadzelics on August 12 2007, which read: 'WISHLIST RAPE A 12 YR OLD F*** TWO UNDERAGE TWINS'.

""The message corroborated Ms Mjadzelics's allegations that Watkins had expressed 'desires to abuse children'.""

Ms Mjadzelics was cleared of possessing indecent images of children in January 2015, having told Cardiff Crown Court she was trying to entrap the depraved singer.

An NSPCC Cymru Wales spokesman said the report's damning conclusions should be a ""wake-up call"" for all those involved.

""That a simple unchecked mobile phone could have helped to prevent further abuse by Watkins is unthinkable, and is just one cause for significant concern among this catalogue of basic failures,"" he said.

""While Watkins is now thankfully behind bars where he belongs, and improvements have already been made by South Wales Police, it's clear that very serious mistakes were made in handling multiple early allegations and this report's recommendations must be adopted swiftly.""

In total the IPCC investigation found South Wales Police did not adequately action eight reports and three intelligence logs from six individuals concerning the activities of Watkins between 2008 and 2012.

Mr Williams said: ""Some were conflated with reports made by Ms Mjadzelics and were thus dismissed as lacking credibility.

""All those involved in responding accepted the initial sceptical view of Ms Mjadzelics's reports, demonstrating a lack of open-mindedness and professional curiosity. This continued until 'the right type of complainant came along'.

""Police officers will rarely encounter a perfect witness; it is vital that officers ensure they remain open-minded and pursue all appropriate lines of enquiry to establish whether there is any independent corroboration for the allegations being made.""

Other missed opportunities detailed in the report include:

The IPCC found an alleged victim and her parents were not visited by officers following Ms Mjadzelics's complaint in 2008 Crimestoppers reports from 2010, and reports from two witnesses in that year and in 2012 ""do not appear to have been progressed"", despite corroborating Ms Mjadzelics's account No actions was taken on Ms Mjadzelics's email complaint to the ACPO inbox in 2011 that her reports had not been properly investigated

She added the investigation found no evidence to show that police inaction was a result of Watkins's celebrity, rather the assessment of Ms Mjadzelics as lacking credibility.

Ms Williams said that the decision-making on the reports involved a small number of officers but the investigation found ""weaknesses"" in South Wales Police procedures relating to allegations of child abuse including: poor record keeping and retention; poor management of intelligence; safeguarding; supervision; a lack of rigour in progressing investigations; the handling of third party reports as opposed to those from victims; and an inadequate approach to cross border investigations.

South Wales Police accepted the findings of the IPCC report, which Ms Williams said ""does provide assurance to the public that if they come forward with credible concerns, they will be taken seriously and investigated thoroughly"".

Following the investigation it was decided one officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct, and two officers had a case to answer for misconduct.

At a hearing in May, Detective Sergeant Andrew Whelan was cleared of wrongdoing and a decision has been made not to take any further action concerning two detective constables.

In a report issued last Friday, the IPCC found that three officers from South Yorkshire Police would have a case to answer for gross misconduct, but as each has retired following 30 years' service, no further action can be taken.

253,253,"After 42 years of painting in solitude without recognition, Michael Hartung of Lindsborg is finally making his public art debut.

Hartung, 72, has three simultaneous exhibits showing now -- one in Lindsborg, one at the Salian Art Center in Salina and one at the Moss-Thorns Gallery of Art in Rarick Hall at Fort Hays State University in Hays.

""Gas Stations, Laundromats, and the Spaces in Between,"" opens Friday during the Fall Art Walk. Hartung will be on hand to speak and answer questions about his art between 6 and 9 p.m.

This slideshow requires JavaScript.

Hartung was raised in Fredonia. He narrowly escaped taking shop class in high school.

""I hated the shop teacher, but he hated me too,"" Hartung said.

He had a stint in drafting class, but he loved to draw freehand, which drove his drafting teacher crazy. Finally during his senior year, he landed in an art class taught by a recent graduate of Bethany College who had been inspired by the work of Birger Sandzen.

""It prepped me for college and a bigger environment,"" he said.

He earned a bachelor's degree in art education at Emporia State University before being drafted into the Army during the Vietnam War. He knew he did not want to teach art because the people he saw teaching were not doing art except for an occasional faculty exhibit. He returned to school briefly, but decided he would rather paint than deal with the politics of grad school.

Hartung moved to Lindsborg and went to work for Arrow Printing, in Salina. He spent long hours laying negatives for Arrow, a job that was eliminated by computers shortly after his retirement.

""It paid,"" he said of his job. ""I had enough money for any record or book I ever wanted. That is all I wanted.""

All of Hartung's spare time was spent painting. He had an upstairs studio in Lindsborg where he painted anything and everything his mind could conjure.

Boxes of LPs and CDs are stacked near to the ceiling in his studio. Besides his paints, a mattress on the floor is about the only other item in his home of 40 years.

""All I wanted I had. I never asked for nor did I desire for notoriety,"" he said. ""I had a semi-drawn out goal of what I wanted. I kept my nose down and had a full-time job to support it.""

Hartung painted anything that came to his mind.

""Basically I painted everything I wanted to paint. That is sort of what I did,"" he said. ""Everything was open. There were no limits. I was not painting for an audience. I painted some real clunkers too. It has been interesting. I'm glad I did it.""

Hartung did not like art history class. Everything was identified by a date and an ""ism."" Hartung never dated any of his work. He stacked it in a storage room, and many of his painting had not been seen by anyone, including Hartung in decades.

He and some friends went through the art for the exhibits in his unheated storage area during the polar vortex that hit Kansas.

""When they came out to shoot and archive the paintings, I was at a low point,"" he said. ""My health was not doing well. I thought it might be a fool's errand, but it was really fun.""

The exhibit at the Moss-Thorns gallery is a juxtaposition between light-hearted and dark and compelling images, Michael Jilg, local artist and guest curator of the exhibit noted.

A piece of a man sitting on a dunk tank is hung next to an image titled ""Sarcoma,"" which depicts a man dying of cancer.

Another painting depicts a woman crouching in a car that is filling with carbon dioxide from a garden hose. Yet there is another painting that depicts a dream-like image of dandelions at sunrise.

Jilg met Hartung some time ago, but did not know all the work he was doing in his second-floor studio. Not many people did, he said, adding Hartung was known in Lindsborg, but not among the art world.

""He was upstairs in his studio, drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, painting his life away,"" Jilg said.

Jilg encouraged art lovers to come out and visit with Hartung Friday who he described as being, talkative and friendly with an almost David Letterman- type personality.

Hartung said he never struggled to find things to paint. Rather he had often had to submit his ideas to a process of elimination before he started a painting.

""So many of them just come to me. I guess I am just lucky,"" he said.

His mother is a reoccurring theme in his paintings. She raised Hartung and his siblings for a time by herself after Hartung's father left.

One of the paintings at the Moss-Thorns exhibit depicts his mother, who has fallen asleep in a chair after a long day of work, while Hartung and his siblings are in the bathroom getting ready for bed.

Hartung said he remembers those times in his youth as good times, but he also was very aware they were difficult for his mother. Through the shows, he has been able to meet some people who knew his mother, which he said he appreciated.

All of Hartung's pieces are on Masonite. He said he chose Masonite because he hated stretching canvas. His pieces mirror the size of the Masonite sheets and are nailed to the gallery walls just as they were nailed to Hatung's studio walls when they were painted.

Hartung has also been influenced by music, including early rock 'n' roll and rockabilly. A painting titled ""When the Levee Breaks"" is a part of the Moss-Thorns exhibit. The painting is based on a song of the same name by Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe. He heard the song one night on NPR and fell in love with the musical artists.

""That painting was from that little radio experience,"" he said. ""It was all oral. It was something oral and not visual.""

Hartung recently has been in poor health, which was the impetus for his friends to mount the three exhibits. Hartung said he would like to see the paintings stay in Lindsborg where they were created. He hoped a Lindsborg Arts Council could be formed, similar to the council here in Hays, and the paintings could be gifted to that organization.

As far as the exhibit that opens Friday, Hartung said he hopes that he can affect the viewers in some way.

""I hope they are entertained,"" he said of exhibit visitors. ""I hope they enjoy themselves. I think that is all you can ask. Some might make you think.

""Some people identify with certain people in the paintings. 'Night Swim' has a gal wearing a '5os-style bathing suit. Someone told me he remembered going out at night at a local swimming hole. That he remembered that and that painting conjured that up, makes me really tickled. I figure and kind of wanted to portray that era of bathing suit. That this brings back something in someone else's life, that is great.""

Hartung's Moss-Thorns exhibit will be on display through Sept. 15, www.fhsu.edu/art-and-design/moss-thorns, 785-628-4247. The gallery is open 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays.

254,254,"Scientists have come up with two clever new ways to harness the programming power of DNA in living bacterial cells. In separate experiments published in Nature in July, researchers reported that they had successfully archived a movie and built a complex biological computer inside living E. coli cells.

The experiments expand our ability to exploit DNA's encoding potential. ""What these papers represent is just how good we are getting at harnessing that power,"" says Julius Lucks, a bioengineer at the Center for Synthetic Biology, at Northwestern University, in Evanston, Ill., who was not involved in either report.

Researchers for both experiments relied on electrical engineering principles to achieve their feats. In the DNA storage experiments, a team at Harvard University demonstrated for the first time how to encode a movie and an image into living cells. Storage of digital data in DNA has been achieved before -- as much as 200 megabytes -- but until now, no one had archived data inside a living organism, says Seth Shipman, a neuroscientist at Harvard who led the experiments.

To get a movie into E. coli's DNA, Shipman and his colleagues had to disguise it. They converted the movie's pixels into DNA's four-letter code -- molecules represented by the letters A,T,G and C -- and synthesized that DNA. But instead of generating one long strand of code, they arranged it, along with other genetic elements, into short segments that looked like fragments of viral DNA.

E. coli is naturally programmed by its own DNA to grab errant pieces of viral DNA and store them in its own genome -- a way of keeping a chronological record of invaders. So when the researchers introduced the pieces of movie-turned-synthetic DNA -- disguised as viral DNA -- E. coli's molecular machinery grabbed them and filed them away.

The movie they stored was a 36-by-26-pixel GIF of one of the first moving images ever recorded: a galloping mare named Annie G., by Eadweard Muybridge­ in 1887. The team was able to retrieve it, along with a separate image, with about 90 percent accuracy by sequencing the bacterium's genome.

The same month Shipman announced the storage breakthrough, a separate group of researchers reported another cleverly programmed piece of synthetic DNA. This one, when introduced into E. coli, can direct the cell to produce a biological computer made of ribonucleic acid, or RNA.

The ""ribocomputer"" can evaluate up to a dozen inputs, make logic-based decisions using AND, OR, and NOT operations, and give the cell commands. The system is the most complex biological computer to date and is one of the few that operates inside a living cell, says Alexander Green, an engineer at the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, in Tempe, who developed the technology with colleagues at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering.

The biological circuit enables researchers to program cells to respond when they receive a particular type of input. For instance, cells could be programmed to light up or self-destruct when they sense the presence of a toxin or a marker of cancer.

Taken together, these advances in DNA storage and biological computing are reminiscent of the early days of electronics, say researchers. ""It's like a golden age of circuit design,"" says Timothy Lu, a bioengineer in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT, who was not involved in the work. ""It's a great time for creative circuit engineers to be in the field.""

In order to build more complex biological computers, or store increasingly complex data in DNA, bioengineers will need to borrow electrical engineering concepts. ""That way of thinking -- the way that electrical engineers have gone about establishing design hierarchy or abstraction layers -- I think that's going to be really important for biology,"" says Lu.

One doesn't need a life sciences background to participate, adds Lucks. ""We can create a layer of abstraction where you don't need to know about RNA folding to design a circuit out of RNA,"" he says.

At some point -- perhaps much further down the road -- the public will need to weigh in on the idea of forcing living things to perform functions that fall so far outside their normal activities. ""We can make bacteria compute information and store a movie. Is that okay?"" says Lucks. ""I don't think anybody would really argue that it's unethical to do this in E. coli. But as you go up in the chain [of living organisms], it gets more interesting from an ethical point of view."""
255,255,"My father Roy Bentley, who has died aged 87, was a medical physicist whose career spanned almost the entire history of the speciality.

The son of Frank, a chartered accountant, and his wife, Stella (nee Barker), who helped out in the family hosiery and glove business, Roy was educated at West Bridgford grammar school, Nottingham, and Birmingham University. His PhD, awarded in 1955, focused on the uptake of radioisotopes in fats and laid significant ground for the use of markers in medical imaging.

In May 1957, days after completing his national service as an RAF radio instructor, Roy married Kathleen Kelly, a musician whom he met at university, and at the end of the month joined the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) at the Royal Marsden hospital, Surrey.

After a fire at the Windscale nuclear plant, in Cumbria, that year, radioactive contamination spread across the UK; this was also at the time of intensive airborne testing of hydrogen bombs. It was therefore important to assess how much contamination could enter the human body. Roy developed and operated radiation detectors to measure small amounts of beta radioactivity: beta particles are able to penetrate and change the molecular structure of living matter. This can cause cancer or death. He published several papers on the subject in Nature.

Roy then turned his attention to the application of computers in medicine, working on radiotherapy treatment planning and, with the physicist Jo Milan, developed the first computerised system for radiotherapy treatment in the UK. It shortened the time taken to calculate the correction dose of radiation and made its application more accurate. This work underpins the image-based systems that are now an integral part of radiotherapy treatment.

Roy was also instrumental in the introduction of a computerised hospital information system, and in 1983 brought the first departmental computer to the Royal Marsden physics department. He commented at the time: ""The VAX computer has something called email. I doubt this will ever catch on but I'll enable it anyway.""

A founder member of the International Conference on the Use of Computers in Radiotherapy, Roy travelled extensively, making significant contacts in eastern Europe and learning German to further communications at a time when English was not so widely spoken.

While taking a year's sabbatical in the biomedical computer department at Washington University, St Louis, in 1967-68, he was in the first team to link a computer online to a gamma camera. In this way he succeeded in digitally imaging medical radioisotopes, which reveal abnormalities in organs of the body. In this and many other areas, Roy played key roles in providing the expertise and infrastructure that are at the core of many cancer treatments to this day.

He retired in 1995 and served for several years as a Liberal Democrat councillor in the London borough of Sutton. He supported the work of Amnesty International and continued volunteering for Age Concern into his 80th year.

Roy is survived by Kathleen and their sons, Paul and me."
256,256,"RHS has received new technology that will help doctors with cancer diagnosis.

The Rwanda Military Hospital (RMH) has received new telepathology technology that enables medical professionals to carry out pathology at a distance using telecommunications technology to facilitate the transfer of image-rich pathological data for diagnosis, education, and research. Named OMNYX VL4, the system consists of an indoor scanner, cameras, a microscope, and computers.

As revealed by RMH, the system scans and displays a patient's results on a computer monitor. The images shown can then be shared online with other medical professionals within the hospital, as well as hospitals globally, for examination of the nature of the illness and how it can be handled.

""Testing and treating cancer is a big challenge globally, and here in Rwanda, we have a specific challenge of not having many specialised doctors in both testing and treatment of the disease. So, this new system comes as a way of helping us to test and diagnose cancer faster as we communicate among us so that we can be able to administer immediate treatment that will give patients more chances to recover,"" said Lt Col Fabien Ntaganda, the head of laboratory services at RMH.

The new technology is capable of testing all types of cancers both in children and adults, and the doctors will be able to provide the diagnosis and a therapeutic decision within five days as opposed to the two weeks it has been taking. The hospital has partnered with doctors in America, who will work remotely receiving the images and responding within 24 hours.

""In the new system the images appear on a computer screen and the doctors will not have to strain themselves looking into the microscope,"" Ntaganda said.

As revealed by RMH, other East African countries - including Uganda and Tanzania - are looking to roll out the technology soon."

259,259,"MEDICS are warming up to a new telepathology technology brought in at the Rwanda Military Hospital (RMH), Kanombe, saying it will make cancer diagnosis faster and easier.

The tech enables the medics to carry out pathology at a distance using telecommunications technology to facilitate the transfer of image-rich pathological data for diagnosis, education, and research.

The system, named ""OMNYX tm VL4,"" consists of an indoor scanner, cameras, a microscope, and computers.

It scans and displays a patient's results on a computer monitor and the images can be shared online with other medics within RMH, other hospitals in the country or in other parts of the world for examination of the nature of illness and how it can be handled.

""Testing and treating cancer is a big challenge globally, and here in Rwanda, we have a specific challenge of not having many specialised doctors in both testing and treatment of the disease. So, this new system comes as a way of helping us to test and diagnose cancer faster as we communicate among us so that we can be able to administer immediate treatment that will give patients more chances to recover,"" said Lt Col Fabien Ntaganda, the head of laboratory services at RMH.

RMH has already established a partnership with the American Society of Clinical Pathologists based in Boston, where 15 American doctors volunteered to work with the hospital, receiving the images and responding within 24 hours.

The new technology is capable of testing all types of cancers both in children and adults, and the doctors will be able to provide the diagnosis and a therapeutic decision within five days as opposed to the two weeks it has been taking.

""In the new system the images appear on a computer screen and the doctors will not have to strain themselves looking into the microscope,"" Ntaganda said.

Acquired with support from the US under President Obama's programme of helping African countries in easing cancer treatment, the system is only the second in Africa.

The first on the continent, too, is in Rwanda at Butaro Hospital and it was installed in May 2016.

Uganda and Tanzania are currently working on rolling out the technology.

Working with a trainer from US, RMH has trained 14 local cancer pathologists to use the technology (six from RMH, three from King Faisal Hospital, Kigali, and five from Central University Teaching Hospital of Kigali).

Dr Emile Karinganire, a pathologist at RMH, said the system will keep medics up-to-date with medical knowledge as they will be sharing information.

He added that it will also be of great importance to pathology students who come for training at the hospital since they will be able to access rich information using the system.

The cancer tests will still be carried out on the usual means of payment, including the Mituelle system."

261,261,"The federal Bureau of Prisons faces a sea of troubles: Escalating medical costs, a prison population with little access to job training programs or computers, an institutional culture averse to change.

In steps Mark S. Inch, the retired two-star general selected by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month to run the Bureau of Prisons. Inch retired from the Army in May after more than three decades in the military, mostly as a police officer.

While some prison advocates are wary of a leader from an organization disgraced by the abuses at Abu Ghraib, others say a military man may have the courage and discipline to move a stodgy federal prison system toward reforms that have been stalled for years.

""He would provide strong leadership, demand accountability, transparency, and I believe he would be a general who has the ability to think outside the box,"" said federal prison consultant Jack Donson, who does not know Inch but worked for the Bureau of Prisons for more than two decades.

In a statement after appointing Inch, Sessions called the retired general ""uniquely qualified"" because of his policing background and his time overseeing Army Corrections over the past two years. He replaces Thomas Kane, a 40-year veteran of the federal prison system who had been acting director since early 2016.

The Bureau of Prisons houses more than 187,000 inmates and employs more than 39,000 workers spread out across 122 correctional facilities, six regional offices, a headquarters, two training centers, and 25 residential reentry management offices. The BOP also has contracts with 11 private prisons.

Outside the military, not much is known about Inch, especially among those who have worked in the federal prison system, prisoner advocates and corrections officials. Will Inch be an ally for better prisoner education? Will he limit the amount of time prisoners are held in isolation? Will he rely on controversial for-profit prisons to house new inmates?

Inch hasn't said. Prisoner advocacy groups have asked Justice officials if any hearings will be held to examine Inch's background and priorities. They were told no.

Inch is the latest of several former generals the Trump administration has chosen for top positions that have been historically manned by civilians. Others include former national security advisor Michael Flynn and his replacement, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. Retired Gen. John Kelly went from secretary of Homeland Security to President Trump's chief of staff. Retired Gen. James Mattis serves as defense secretary.

""It's odd to say the least to see another former military official take the lead on a civilian domestic policy issue,"" said Ed Chung, vice president for criminal justice reform at the liberal Center for American Progress and a former senior advisor at the Department of Justice. ""He's kind of a mystery man way out of the blue.""

The Department of Justice declined a request for an interview with Inch.

From the beginning of his more than three-decade military career, Inch focused on policing and corrections. He studied Military Police Officer Basic and Advance Courses and was certified by the American Correctional Association, according to the U.S. Army. As a major, Inch helped train and reestablish Somali police forces after a civil war during the United Nations operation in Somalia, which was marked by a battle in the capital city of Mogadishu in 1993 where 19 U.S. service members and hundreds of Somali militia and civilians were killed. The battle was depicted in the book and film ""Black Hawk Down.""

In 2008 and 2009, Inch served as chief of staff for a joint interagency task force in Baghdad, Iraq. Between July 2013 and July 2014, he served as the commanding general of the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force 435 -- a military partnership with Afghan forces -- in Kabul during Operation Enduring Freedom. He was responsible for detainee operations and rule of law development within the Army's Security Sector.

In 2014, Inch was appointed Provost Marshal General, the top military police officer of the U.S. Army, and took command of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command and Army Corrections. He held the position until he retired from the military in May.

Many of the detention controversies that have dogged the military since the Iraq and Afghanistan war occurred before or after Inch was in a commanding position. He was in Iraq two years after control of the notorious Abu Ghraib prison was handed over to the Iraqis and all the detainees were transferred elsewhere. He was the commander of the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, two years before Chelsea Manning was sentenced to 35 years of confinement for downloading classified documents and videos that were shared with the WikiLeaks website. In January, President Barack Obama commuted her sentence.

Religion has played a central part in Inch's life. He earned a bachelor's degree in biblical archaeology in 1982 from Wheaton College, a Christian college in Illinois. (He also holds a masters degree in geography with a concentration in Middle East/Africa from the University of Texas at Austin, as well as a masters of military arts and science Degree from the School of Advanced Military Studies at Fort Leavenworth.)

In an introspective and revealing interview published in March by a military blog, Inch said that he suffered from sleep problems and symptoms of post traumatic stress after serving in Somalia. He sought help from a Christian counselor and chaplain, and said it took him five years to recover. He indicated that the experience left him with a great deal of empathy for a generation of soldiers who have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003.

""It probably took about two years to see the real fracture lines that that period of the deployment and post deployment had in my marriage,"" he told MP Project Junto, a blog for military police. ""It brought my late wife and I to the point of knowing that we needed help. We went to a family life chaplain at Fort Carson. And it really wasn't until the next assignment in Japan that I remember Barb and I sitting having a glass of wine on the back deck and she looked at me and said, 'We're really back at a good place.' And we were. And we were for the next 15 years of marriage before she passed.""

Inch's wife, Barbara Corinne Inch, died in 2012 after a 15-month battle with cancer. Barbara, who spent more than two decades in the military, met Inch when he served as her unit's evaluator in 1984. They married the next year. An obituary posted on Legacy.com said Inch credits Barbara with his ""rise from First Lieutenant to General Officer.""

Inch has since remarried. His wife, Bette Stebbins Inch, works as the Senior Victim Assistance Advisor for the Department of Defense, according to the Army.

Advocates for reform wonder if Inch's empathy for soldiers with post traumatic stress disorder might also make him empathetic toward the plight of prisoners.

Donson, citing a ""leadership void"" at the agency, said he hoped Inch would streamline the agency's top-heavy administration and begin recommending more elderly or infirm prisoners be eligible for BOP's ""compassionate release"" program, designed to free up prison space and reduce medical costs associated with caring for these prisoners.

Last fall, the federal Inspector General's office reported that only five inmates were granted compassionate release in fiscal year 2016, despite a rapidly growing list of applications from aging baby boomers. Applicants seeking compassionate release must get approval from the BOP before the request goes before a judge, and prisoner advocates say most requests never go that far.

The Charles Colson Task Force on Federal Corrections, a bipartisan panel established by Congress to find ways to improve the federal corrections system, visited the U.S. Penitentiary in Atlanta, where members saw several ""fragile, elderly, and infirmed people and others in very poor health,"" according to a report early last year.

Task force members learned of many men who had petitioned for compassionate release but were denied despite serving time for drug sentences based on crimes committed ""literally decades ago.""

""BOP is so cautious and afraid,"" Donson said. ""It's easier to deny things.""

A report released late last month by the Government Accountability Office showed that the BOP's health costs rose 37 percent from fiscal year 2009 to 2016 -- an increase per prisoner of more than $2,200.

""BOP lacks or does not analyze certain health care data necessary to understand and control its costs,"" the GAO report stated.

Laurie Robinson, a George Mason University professor of criminology, law and society, and a former assistant attorney general who was on the Colson task force, said she hopes Inch can be the ""change agent"" it desperately needs.

Other prison reformers hope Inch pushes the Bureau of Prisons to give prisoners nearing release more time in halfway houses to better prepare them for release, a move endorsed by Congress. The agency has told prisoner advocates it doesn't have enough housing to fully comply.

The agency consistently faces criticism for not doing enough to get prisoners ready for reentry. In May, Families Against Mandatory Minimums released a survey of more than 2,000 federal inmates that found just 3 percent had access to computers. Trying to get a college education in prison was nearly impossible, and job skills programs are only available to inmates who are nearing release. The survey found that nearly all continuing education classes are led by fellow prisoners with little teaching experience.

""What are we doing with these people when they're locked up?"" Mary Price, FAMM's general counsel, asked. ""One of the things we ought be doing is rehabilitating them, and that's one of the big pieces missing here.""

Another Inspector General's report released in July found the Bureau of Prisons grossly lacking in the number of professionals needed to treat mental illness. It found that only 3 percent of the federal inmate population was receiving mental health treatment in 2015, even though an internal study estimated that 19 percent of inmates had a history of mental illness. The agency's chief psychiatrist, meanwhile, estimated that far more people were suffering from a mental illness than the bureau was reporting.

If Inch wants to address these shortfalls, he will have to be creative. The fiscal year 2018 budget includes the elimination of 14 percent of the Bureau of Prison's staff -- 6,100 jobs."

263,263,"Machine learning can be the difference between life and death. The technology, which enables computers teach themselves, is about more than who has the world's biggest AI platform -- or how well a platform evaluates cookie recipes; it could be a tremendous boon for precision medicine, which tailors healthcare to the specifics of individual patients.

Using precision medicine for cancer treatment, for example, involves identifying characteristics that could help predict a specific treatment's effectiveness for a specific patient, OncLive stated. Legacy methods might have based treatment on the cancer's stage, which is a relatively limited indicator of success.

""Imagine if you could take results of all of the tests ... and the results of the treatment that was done, and aggregate and anonymize all of that data, and apply machine learning to learn from that which treatments were the most effective,"" Mike Flannagan, senior vice president of SAP Analytics, said at SAP Leonardo Live in Frankfurt last month. ""Not only could you reduce the amount of the chemotherapy that was required for a patient, but you could also reduce the amount of patients who received an unnecessary dose -- or who received a type of chemotherapy that didn't work.""

Machine Learning Tames the Human Genome

""We have all the data ... more data than we'll ever be able to consume in our lifetime,"" Flannagan said. ""Where machine learning comes in is ... to turn the processing, the understanding, the deriving of meaning from that data over to machines.""

One treasure trove is the patient's genome, a massive DNA dataset within an individual's 23 chromosome pairs. Advances in IT infrastructure have enabled physicians to treat -- or change treatment -- for thousands of patients based on their genome, according to Hospitals & Health Networks.

""Genomic sequencing is a ... noninvasive tool that continues to provide useful information for years after it is performed,"" Louanne Hudgins, M.D., president of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, stated in H&HN. ""Because of these advances, therapy and management of these diseases are much improved -- [and] the idea that there is no treatment for genetic disorders is just not true anymore.""

Keeping an Eye on the Big Picture

""Every drug is different when it interacts with every human body, so what works well for one person may not work well for another,"" SAP's Flannagan said. ""It also has to do with what other medications they're taking -- so you can imagine trying, as a doctor or a pharmacist, to keep all of that information in your system.""

Myriad factors -- a patient's weight, age, blood pressure, preexisting conditions, etc. -- make optimized real-time prescription terribly difficult, according to Flannagan. As a result, physicians tend to prescribe what has worked for other patients in the past, as opposed to treating the individual, as precision medicine would dictate.

This underscores the importance of pharmacists in precision medicine.

""Pharmacists provide value to clinical decisions for precision medicines because they understand and can manage patients' entire drug profile,"" Murray Aitken, executive director of the QuintilesIMS Institute, stated in The Pharmaceutical Journal on Thursday. ""Pharmacists are also point-of-care references for dosing and administration, and can advise on potential side effects.""

IoT Keeping Medication Safe and Secure

""Pharmacists must be prepared for some unique challenges associated with precision medicine -- among these challenges is the safety of these medicines,"" stated Aitken, who is also co-author of this year's report Upholding the Clinical Promise of Precision Medicine. ""Therapies included in our analysis showed that 41 percent were associated with black box warnings for serious adverse events that can require specialized monitoring by trained clinicians.""

Increasingly personalized medicines intensifies the need for a completely connected and transparent global healthcare supply chain, according to Supply Chain Digital last month. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can monitor location, temperature, light exposure, humidity, barometric pressure and shock, as well as security to guard against theft and counterfeiting.

""While supply chain control and visibility is important for all industries, it's absolutely vital for the healthcare industry ... imagine if a shipment holding medicine that was personalized for the DNA of a cancer patient was spoiled or stolen,"" Supply Chain Digital stated. ""You can't pull a substitute off the warehouse shelf and ship it overnight.""

Changing Society One Patient at a Time

Machine learning has the potential to dramatically improve patient outcomes when we use technology to look for patterns that a single physician couldn't possibly see, according to SAP's Flannagan. That's because precision medicine requires examination of the entire population of data -- from all of the patients and all of the healthcare providers.

""That's the kind of learning that has the ability to really change society, and change the health of a large number of patients across a large number of health conditions,"" Flannagan said. ""But only when you're able to bring the power of machine learning to that data.""

A new technology brought in at the Rwanda Military Hospital will make cancer diagnosis faster and easier, medics have said.

The new tech enables the medics to carry out pathology at a distance using telecommunication technology to facilitate the transfer of image-rich pathology data between distant locations for the purposes of diagnosis, education, and research.

The system named ""OMNYX tm VL4"" consists of an indoor scanner, cameras, a microscope, and computers.

It scans and displays the patient's results on a computer screen and the images of them can be shared online with other medics within RMH itself, other hospitals in the country or in the different parts of the world for medics to have a look and advise their counterparts on the nature of illness and how it can be handled.

""Testing and treating cancer is a big challenge globally, and here in Rwanda, we have a specific challenge of not having many specialised doctors in both testing and treatment of the disease.

""So, this new system comes as a way of helping us to test and diagnose cancer faster as we communicate among us so that we can be able to administer immediate treatment that will give the patients more opportunities to recover,"" said Lt. Colonel Fabien Ntaganda, the head of laboratory services at RMH.

RMH has already established a partnership with the American Society of Clinical Pathologists based in Boston USA, where fifteen American doctors volunteered to work with the hospital, receiving the images and responding in 24 hours.

It is capable of testing all types of cancers both in children and adults, and the doctors will be able to provide the diagnosis and a therapeutic decision within five days as opposed to the two weeks it used to take them before."

Students of a certain age have spent the last year worrying about (and occasionally revising for) their GCSEs.

While the horror of exams ended a few months ago, tomorrow will hold a whole new type of terror for year 11 pupils - results day.

But how important are these results? Sure, they might make or break your chances of getting into a sixth-form college, but do they matter when it comes to university applications?

MORE: When is GCSE results day 2017?

Will universities look at my GCSE grades?

The majority of universities will only look at your A-level grades and your application when considering whether or not to accept you - meaning they will probably take a look at what extra-curricular activities you took part in.

Teenager saved £6,000 a year on shopping after taking over from mum when she got cancer

More competitive universities will also want to see your GCSE results to make sure you have consistently been a high-achieving student, however if you have a strong application and interview well they might look past a few poor GCSE results.

The top tier universities (Cambridge, Oxford, UCL etc.) will usually require good A-level, AS-level and GCSE results from all students who get accepted.

Some universities have this as an 'unwritten rule', while others will state the requirements outright.

For example, London School of Economics mention in their prospectus that applicants will have 'already achieved excellent GCSE grades including the majority at A* and A'.

Will my GCSE results affect what I can study?

What you choose to study might also be impacted by your GCSE results.

Most medicine courses expect applicants to have been getting A and A* results throughout their school career.

If you don't get the results you want, this doesn't mean you should give up hope.

Remember that university applications are accepted or rejected by humans, not computers.

Therefore they will be able to see if you are a genuinely talented person who will work hard and do well at the university, even if you have a few blips on your academic record."
266,266,"ARMONK, N.Y., Aug. 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The general public's help is being enlisted in what's thought to be the biggest study of the human microbiome -- the bacteria that live in and on the human body -and are believed to affect health.

The Microbiome Immunity Project is a new, IBM-facilitated (NYSE: IBM) citizen science project by scientists from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, University of California San Diego, and the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute. It will use the surplus processing power on volunteers' computers to conduct millions of virtual experiments on behalf of the researchers. These experiments aim to map the three million bacterial genes found in the human microbiome and predict the structure of their associated proteins. The project will begin with the analysis of the microbiome in the digestive system.

This study aims to help scientists better understand the microbiome's interaction with human biochemistry and determine how that interaction may contribute to autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis -- illnesses that affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and that are being diagnosed with increasing frequency. With better understanding, scientists might be able to more easily prevent and treat these diseases.

Because studying the entire human microbiome would be almost impossible with traditional methods, massive supercomputing processing power is being crowdsourced via IBM's World Community Grid. Anyone in the world can help by simply volunteering to provide compute power. Here's how it works: People download a secure software program that automatically detects when a computer can offer spare processing power, then taps it to run virtual experiments on behalf of researchers.

The resulting data from millions of these experiments will be analyzed by the project's research team. The researchers will make that data publicly available to other scientists, accelerating the advancement of scientific knowledge -and ultimately improved treatments -of autoimmune diseases.

""This type of research on the human microbiome, on this scale, has not been done before,"" said Dr. Ramnik Xavier, Institute Member and Co-Director of the Infectious Disease and Microbiome Program, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; Chief, Gastrointestinal Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital; and Director, Center for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital. ""It's only possible with massive computational power.""

According to Dr. Rob Knight, Professor in the Departments of Pediatrics and Computer Science & Engineering and Director of the Center for Microbiome Innovation at UC San Diego, ""Had World Community Grid not existed, we wouldn't have even contemplated this project. By harnessing the efforts of volunteers, we can do something that exceeds the scale of what we have access to by a factor of thousands. For the first time, we're bringing a comprehensive structural biology picture to the whole microbiome, rather than solving structures one at a time in a piecemeal fashion. ""

The project's third principal investigator, Dr. Rich Bonneau, Group Leader for Systems Biology at the Center for Computational Biology at the Flatiron Institute in New York City, and Professor at New York University, ran World Community Grid's first project, which studied the folding of proteins in the human body and has been cited by other experts in the field of protein function.

Anyone with a computer and an internet connection can join World Community Grid and sign up to support the Microbiome Immunity Project.

Since its founding in 2004, World Community Grid has supported 29 research projects in areas such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, Zika, clean water, renewable energy and other humanitarian challenges. To date, World Community Grid, hosted by IBM Cloud, has connected researchers to $500 million U.S. dollars' worth of free supercomputing power. More than 730,000 individuals and 430 institutions from 80 countries have donated more than one million years of computing time from more than three million computers and Android devices. Volunteer participation has helped researchers to identify potential treatments for childhood cancer, more efficient solar cells, and more efficient water filtration.

267,267,"In 2013, the United States ceded the supercomputing crown to China, whose Sunway TaihuLight machine is over five times as powerful as the U.S. government's fastest system, called Titan. But the Department of Energy is working on a new generation of supercomputers that are 50 times faster than Titan -- a performance boost described as ""exascale."" Today, DoE awarded $258 million in contracts to six U.S. companies -- AMD, Cray (maker of Titan), Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Intel, and Nvidia -- to build an exascale system by 2021. The companies themselves are expected to add at least $172 million of their own funding to the project, since they will also benefit from the new technologies developed.

Technological contributions to the Exascale Computing Project will vary. In the first phase, companies will be designing technologies that could potentially be used in a future system, says Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). It will be pushing a new computer architecture that keeps data in monstrous amounts of superfast RAM where it can be worked on all at once, rather than shuttling it to and from slower hard drives. This pool of data will be a ""fabric"" linking processors that work on the data. HPE introduced a prototype of this technology, called The Machine last month.

That memory-oriented approach seems to jibe with IBM's philosophy. ""High performance computing is shifting from a purely compute-centric model to one that is much more data-centric,"" writes James Sexton of IBM Research in an email to Fast Company. ""The ability to manage, train, sort and analyze the data 'where it resides' and 'as it flows' through the system is critical to gaining insight quickly from the plethora of data sources vs. traditional [computing methods].""

Nvidia's contribution will be more-powerful graphics processing units for artificial intelligence -- a generation or more beyond the new Volta chips going into DoE computers already slated for 2018. Beyond the hardware, DoE is also charging the companies to write powerful software to run the monstrous calculations.

You'd be forgiven for not grasping what the performance goal of 1,000 petaflop/s (quadrillions of calculations per second) means for real-world applications. DoE lists plenty of potential examples, such as simulating the effects of earthquakes, predicting the effectiveness of cancer treatments, designing nuclear fusion reactors, and modeling the aerodynamics of giant wind farms. An April 2017 DoE presentation on phenomena that the system can model even includes the words ""climate change"" -- once in a 30-page document.

One of the Exascale Computing Project's green goals is to boost performance without requiring more energy. But even if DoE succeeds, it will still have a pretty high electric bill. The best-case scenario is a system that consumes 20 megawatts, enough to power about 20,000 homes."

The so-called ""Apple Car"" may never come to be, thanks in large part to a lack of agreement by Apple leadership as to what such a vehicle should do, reports the New York Times' Daisuke Wakabayashi.

Apple has all but abandoned its original plans for building a vehicle in its own factories, and will instead focus its energies on building self-driving systems for other vehicles, according to the report. In the meantime, the company is focusing on a self-driving campus shuttle, codenamed PAIL -- short for ""Palo Alto to Infinite Loop."" Infinite Loop is the street on which Apple's main campus is located and Palo Alto is a city nearby.

Apple employees working on its car effort have experimented with everything from augmented reality dashboards to a whole new ""CarOS"" operating system to replacing the car's steering wheel with a spinning sphere that would offer a wider range of movement, according to The Times report. Apple also looked at ways to hide a self-driving car's lidar array, which is a crucial but often unsightly component that gives such vehicles information about the environment around them.

However, Apple executives apparently couldn't agree on a direction for the car. Apple design guru Jony Ive wanted to focus on a fully self-driving vehicle like those from Google spinoff Waymo. Original project head Steve Zadesky wanted Apple's car to only be semi-autonomous, operating like Tesla's vehicles when they are under the control of the company's Autopilot function.

Now, under current head Bob Mansfield, Apple is rededicating itself to building the underlying systems for self-driving cars -- even if that means building those systems into vehicles from non-Apple manufacturers. To that end, Apple has recently obtained a self-driving car testing permit from California, with CEO Tim Cook publicly stating that the company is working on autonomous systems.

Apple declined to comment. You can read the full New York Times report here.

269,269,"Political activism for science is fine as long as science itself remains trustworthy.

Twice last month, thousands of people descended on Washington, D.C., to show their support for science. They came to stand up to the threat posed by the Trump administration, which has proposed draconian cuts to federal science programs, appointed an Environmental Protection Agency head who denies the scientific consensus on climate change, disbanded a commission to fix forensic science, floated a vaccine safety commission headed by a notorious vaccine ""skeptic,"" and threatened to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change. This new level of political activism on behalf of science has set off a debate over whether it might backfire by turning scientists into just another partisan group.

The concern that scientists will lose the public's trust if they engage in politics is almost certainly overblown. In an era when trust in almost all of our society's institutions has declined, trust in science has held steady. A recent Pew survey found that ""public confidence in scientists stands out among the most stable of about 13 institutions"" that have been rated in a survey conducted regularly since the 1970s. When asked which institutions are likely to act in the best interests of the public, survey respondents had the most confidence in the military, followed by scientists and medical scientists. Elected officials and business leaders ranked at the bottom.

The public trusts science because it is obvious that science works. You don't have to work in a lab to directly see the results of science, which are apparent in our cars, our computers, and our cancer treatments.

But the corollary is that, to keep the public's trust, scientists must continue to deliver on their promise to generate the kinds of reliable knowledge that lead to new technologies, better health, and more economic growth.

The question of whether scientists are publishing reliable research has been raised in recent years -- not so much by politicians, but by scientists themselves. A persistent narrative that science is failing to self-correct has been widely covered in the media, and threatens to become entrenched. This narrative of trouble within science itself is the real threat to science's credibility. If the public stops believing that scientists are reliable, the result will be more fatal to our society's support for research than any of the Trump administration's alternative facts.

There is a lot more that scientists could do to ensure that research is reliable, according to a recent report by the National Academy of Sciences. The report lays out what it considers ""significant"" threats to the integrity of science. Outright fraud is one of these threats, though it is relatively rare. More insidious and widespread are ""detrimental research practices,"" scientific behavior that doesn't quite rise to the level of faking data, but, in the aggregate, corrodes the credibility of science much more. Many of these practices have been widely covered in stories about science's so-called reproducibility crisis: Studies are often poorly designed; statistics are misused; trainees aren't adequately supervised; and, at many journals, peer review is poorly implemented.

Perhaps the most serious of these detrimental practices is ghostwriting, which really should be classified as outright fraud. A scientist, usually one who works for a company, makes significant contributions to a study, but then isn't listed as one of the authors. This hides the role of industry scientists in what is presented to the world as purely academic research. A notorious example is a 2001 study of the Glaxo SmithKline anti-depressant Paxil, which reported that the drug was safe for use in teenagers and was published under the names of 22 prominent academic scientists. Not only did its conclusion turn out to be wrong, but a lawsuit showed that the company had hired other scientists to write the paper. It's unclear how common this practice is, but researchers who sign their names to ghostwritten papers are rarely punished by the academic institutions that employ them, the scientific journals that publish them, or the federal agencies that fund them.

For most scientists, signing their name to a ghostwritten paper would gnaw on their conscience, but that's not true of other, seemingly innocuous research practices listed in the National Academies report. For example, scientists often fail to save all of their data. Academic research labs, with their very non-hierarchical authority structure, can be surprisingly disorganized, and it's easy for old data to disappear. Once a study is published, the raw data often sits on a local server in a cryptically named folder, interpretable only by the graduate student who first generated it. The student eventually leaves, the server gets replaced, and the data is gone forever. Journals should require, as a condition of publication, that researchers deposit their data into freely accessible public repositories.

As the National Academy report argues, certain beneficial trends in science actually make poor research practices more of a threat than ever. Science is more collaborative, more global, and more reliant on big data. This means that work is often done by larger research teams, spread across multiple countries, and comprised of researchers from different specialties. They produce large data sets that are more difficult to store effectively. Often, no single person on a team can fully understand all of the analyses or methods of a study. Cultural differences between scientists from different countries means it can be challenging to settle on a common understanding of what constitutes proper research ethics. And large data sets pose statistical and information technology challenges that not all scientists are equipped to handle.

This means that, to preserve the integrity of science, researchers and their organizations need to police themselves more aggressively. They should embrace higher standards for statistical practice and data sharing, and they should put pressure on their employing institutions to thoroughly and transparently investigate fraud when accusations arise. Collaborations between academic and industry scientists are crucial for bringing the benefits of science to society, but these collaborations should be openly disclosed and carefully monitored by the scientists' employers and sponsors.

We've already seen thousands of people take to the streets to defend the integrity of science against political threats. Scientists, off the street and in the lab, need to be just as willing to defend their work from threats within their own community."

Two Virginia cases working their way through state and federal courts and a Wisconsin case headed for the U.S. Supreme Court could mean ""2018 will be a big year for redistricting,"" said panelist Brian Cannon, executive director of the One Virginia 2021 advocacy group.

""I think the next governor will have this on his desk,"" Cannon said, adding that he thinks sooner or later Virginia will move toward an independent commission to draw House of Delegates, state Senate and congressional districts.

One key gain would be to open the whole process, which usually works to protect incumbents, to public scrutiny, he said, noting that the work the General Assembly's consultants do to draw lines is shielded under Virginia's Freedom of Information Act.

Panelist Quentin Kidd, director of Christopher Newport University's Wason Center for Public Policy, said taking the process out of the hands of politicians probably wouldn't end Republican control of the House of Delegates, thought it would reduce their majority to about 55 seats. The state Senate would probably remain fairly evenly divided.

But the real benefit of more competitive districts would be that legislators would be free to focus more on working with others to make policy, rather than to placate the most partisan voters who determine who a party's nominee will be in a primary or local firehouse caucus.

""It would free every one of the Republicans and every one of the Democrats to work on solving problems more than satisfying their base,"" Kidd said.

Gerrymandering, the process of drawing district lines to manipulate election results, ""is a cancer on the system the founders designed,"" Kidd said.

While it's gone on for a centuries, ""it used to be that over by that big oak, there's a lot of Democrats, up by the store, it's Republican,"" Kidd said. It wasn't terribly effective.

But computers and big data -- information beyond just whether a voter cast a ballot in party primary but including consumer behavior -- allow political operatives to predict how a voter or household will likely vote.

""There's a partisan lean to Coke drinkers as opposed to Pepsi drinkers; there's partisan trends for different beers,"" Kidd said.

And mapping programs literally allow the legislature's consultants to draw single houses into or out of a district.

Basically, once a district reaches a point where 54 to 55 percent of voters align with one party, it is safe for that party, Kidd said.

Only a handful of seats in either the House of Delegates or the state Senate aren't that safe for one or the other party, he said.

272,272,"As the mayor, only voter, and sole resident of this incorporated village, Elsie Eiler is pretty used to people asking why she remains here as population: 1.

""But this one fellow, he just kept at it. He kept saying, really, why do you stay?"" recounts Mrs. Eiler. ""I finally said, 'There's something you don't understand. Nobody is keeping me here. I am here because I want to be here.' He looked at me like I was crazy.""

Eiler is not crazy.

She's not even that unusual in broad, sparse rural America. Out here, community is defined less by the people who live next to you and more by the people who would help you if you need it.

And in that, Eiler has a thriving community. Like Rocky Wilson. He strolls in the side door of the tavern operated by Eiler and her late husband since 1971, the only working building left other than the trailer she lives in behind the cafe. No need for salutations. Mr. Wilson heads to the cooler and helps himself to a bottle of pop.

He throws down a dollar, but Eiler ignores it and sizes him up sharply.

""You feeling strong today?"" she asks.

""Watcha need,"" Wilson shrugs.

Eiler had pulled her car up to the cafe last night after getting groceries in Spencer, 20 miles away. She just slightly bumped the motorcycle parked there by another regular, toppling it down. She giggles, embarrassed. Could he pull it upright?

""Sure,"" says Wilson, ambling for the door. ""I'll be back to throw out those cardboard boxes.""

When Eiler grew up on a farm outside Monowi, it was a busy little cluster of farms and businesses, with a population of more than 100. She went to a schoolhouse with four grades in one room, then took a bus to the high school in Lynch seven miles down the road.

She met Rudy Eiler in school. When he graduated, he went to France in the Air Force. ""All the boys went into the military then. There was nothing to keep them here,"" she says. Eiler and a girlfriend headed off to adventure, too. They went to airline agent school in Kansas City, and then worked in Austin and Dallas.

""We went with the big idea we'd be stewardesses, but you had to be 21 to be a stewardess. We were only 19."" They stayed in city-life for a year, ""but neither one of us cared much for it. We knew we wanted to come back.""

She did come back, and got married to Rudy. They farmed for a bit, but then Rudy, a reader and all-around friendly fellow, suggested fixing up the old café and bar in town to run it. ""Fine by me,"" Eiler recalls saying. ""Baby pigs are cute, but there's nothin' cute about them when they get big.""

But by then, the restlessness that defined America's character - the gold-prospecting, homesteading, land-hungry push westward that had left the countryside seeded with small farms and towns - had passed.

Rural America began slowly to empty out. Monowi's three groceries closed. Small farmers sold to big, and left. The post office closed. The other tavern in town settled into the ground. The last funeral held at the wood frame Methodist church was for Eiler's father in 1960, and a birch tree rose to wrap itself around the abandoned building.

Travelers emerging from the broad cornfields of eastern Nebraska to the folded terrain skirting the Missouri River on Highway 12 saw the green road sign announcing Monowi change from Population 11, to 3, and then to 2. When Rudy died of cancer in 2004, the sign changed again.

Rural towns all over are declared ""dying."" It is a too-harsh diagnosis. They are certainly emptier - one can drive the long, straight roads of Nebraska at night, and only occasionally see a solitary light in a window twinkling in a sea of darkness. Seven of Nebraska's counties had a population of less than one person per square mile in the 2010 census.

But they are not dying. People stay because here is more appealing than there - the there of a city, of a suburb, of a retirement home or a room in their daughter's home. They do the work they know. They drive for a half-hour to visit friends they know. Some stay to raise kids. Some stay to harbor memories.

""When Rudy went, a lot of people thought I would be just close the door and leave,"" says Eiler. ""But why? All my friends are here.""

She has a daughter in Tucson, Ariz., and a son near Sioux City, Iowa. Her daughter flies in each November to help with the crush at the café during deer-hunting season, and Eiler often returns with her to Arizona for a few weeks.

""Oh, I'd be welcome to live with either one,"" she says of her grown children. ""And I could do it, if I have to. But then I'd have to make friends all over again.""

Instead, she walks down to the squat, white tavern, every morning except Mondays - she's given herself one day off. The place is a bit worn. On the front of the plain building she has put a beer sign proclaiming the ""World Famous Monowi Tavern."" She puts on a pot of coffee for some of the regulars who drop by, even though she doesn't make breakfast. Come lunchtime and dinner time, though, she will whip up meals from the menu posted on the wall. Burgers $3.50, gizzards $4, steaks $14.75.

She does it all herself. But ""if I get busy, somebody will jump up and help."" Between orders, she hand-washes the dishes or sits at the table to visit. There's a steady stream of visitors. Some regulars drive 10 miles or more every day to check on her and swap stories -- many grew up near Monowi and did not stray far. Gayle Heiser heaves down on a chair, and Eiler brings out a photo of them together in elementary school, posing over a Rodeo red wagon.

Other people drop by because they had heard of the town of population one, or had read about it on Facebook posted by other visitors - Eiler doesn't have any use for computers or a cellphone. On a recent day, Denny and Judy Sloup drove 175 miles to say they had come here, and buy a T-shirt and cap that Eiler sells from a table in the tavern. Before they leave, the 80-something proprietress asks them to sign her guestbook - volume three in her collection.

""How could anybody say I'm isolated when I've had visitors from 47 states and 41 countries?"" she demands. She does the annual paperwork to keep Monowi an incorporated village ""just because I feel like I'd be letting the community down"" she says, if she didn't.

In the winter, she hosts a regular Sunday night came of Euchre, with up to two dozen buddies. She closes ""whenever everybody decides to go home"" - usually around 9 or 10 p.m. When they leave, Monowi's population returns to one.

""Believe me,"" she says with emphasis. ""When I lock up and go home at night, I'm perfectly happy.""

273,273,"If your peak summer accomplishment was cleaning off the patio furniture, you likely weren't in a Cal State Fullerton summer program.

Those students were rubbing elbows with members of Congress, mining genetic information to eradicate disease or helping schoolchildren handle snakes.

While some students were taking classes on campus or traveling to other countries through CSUF study abroad programs, others scattered across the United States to learn, work and share. While they were advancing their studies and adding to their resume, they were also advancing democracy, research science, kids' education or other worthy causes.

Here are three summer programs on the homefront:

Fourteen Cal State Fullerton students dipped their toes into the democratic progress this summer working in Washington, D.C., as part of the DC Scholars Program. Their internship sites included the U.S. Department of Agriculture, House Foreign Affairs Committee and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

""Having Cal State Fullerton students living, working and studying in the nation's capital can be an absolutely transformative experience for them,"" said Robert Castro, professor of criminal justice and one of the program leaders. ""Interns routinely engage in high impact practices -- like cutting-edge research and policy evaluation -- alongside D.C.'s working professionals."" Such deep immersion in the professional culture of Washington clarifies their aspirations.

Senior Jared Hill spent his summer giving tours of the nation's Capitol, researching legislation and writing reports as an intern for Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Elk Grove.

""Learning in the classroom about immigration has been a great resource for what I'm handling in my internship."" Hill said. ""I did the analysis for Kate's Law, which deals with the legal repercussions for crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The research I provided was used by the congressman when he spoke about the bill on the House floor.""

Paulette Maskarino worked in the ombudsman's office of the U.S. Department of Labor, learning about workers' compensation programs. She got to shake hands with Georgia civil liberties leader Rep. John Lewis and hear speeches by Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Tim Kaine and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.

""It's opened my eyes to what I can do with my political science degree,"" Maskarino said.

Raul Gonzalez interned for the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services. The experience defines professionalism and discipline, which employers in both the public and private sectors value, he said.

""Surrounding myself with professional people that share the same interest, immigration in my case, also will enhance my confidence for all upcoming interviews,"" he added.

The group was welcomed in late June with an event hosted by alum Victoria Vasques '76, who announced she and her husband, Fabrice, planned to donate $100,000 to support the DC Scholars program.

The deadline to apply to the spring program is Sept. 18, and the deadline for summer is Feb. 12. For more information: hss.fullerton.edu/cal_state_dc.

Some Cal State Fullerton students left campus over the summer to work on another college campus. Six of them conducted research with scientists around the country as part of the university's Maximizing Access to Research Careers Scholars program.

""The MARC program reminds me that all of the disciplines are connected with each other, and to excel in one, we must sometimes learn from another,"" said Trini Nguyen, who conducted research in UC San Diego's Computer Science Department.

Nguyen was mining genetic information to better understand human diseases. She chose a project outside her discipline to learn skills that will help her in a doctoral program.

At the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Janice Reynaga investigated how fluctuating levels of serotonin during lactation affect the energy balance of dairy cows.

""Since dairy cows are extremely susceptible to disease during the transition period from pregnancy to lactation, we hope to learn how the cows balance essential nutrients and energy during that period,"" she said.

Isabel Serrano decamped to UC San Francisco to help build a mathematical model to investigate the interactions between microRNAs and their target genes. ""MicroRNAs are gene regulators,"" Serrano explains, ""which means that they can be used to silence genes that may be contributing to the spread of cancer.""

Other students did research at Stanford University and the University of Oregon.

Along with the research, MARC scholars attend sessions on how to get into competitive doctoral programs; they also receive stipends to fund their travel to professional conferences, where they present their research.

""The program has changed me,"" Reynaga said. ""The things I once was too scared to do, I have to do with one week or month's notice. I've learned how to talk with my peers and professors in a way that allows me to understand their research. The most important aspect is the structure it brought to my life; within my first semester, I had goals set for the month, the semester, and an idea what I would be doing the whole year.""

Funding for the MARC Scholars program, which benefits minority students seeking careers in biomedical research, comes from the National Institutes of Health.

A lot of summer camps involve art, music and animals. This one draws on those - as well as science and technology - to build youngsters' academic English skills.

Fifteen recent Cal State Fullerton grads and teacher candidates taught pupils at three elementary schools with largely Latino student populations this summer. The camp, Animal Kingdom Adventure, is presented by CSUF's SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union Center for Creativity and Critical Thinking in collaboration with the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District.

The kids drew wildlife and conducted research about the animals using computers and books to boost their English skills. They handled a California kingsnake and beetles, for example, while studying the adaptations, structures and behaviors of desert and grassland animals.

The student teachers in turn learned by partnering with experienced district teachers in the classroom.

""Together we create a classroom environment that is student-centered, with hands-on, minds-on experiences, and teach and develop English skills that students can utilize throughout their schooling,"" said Breána Victoria, who recently earned her master's in education and co-taught fourth-graders at Melrose Elementary School.

""This experience has allowed me to constantly reflect on my teaching strategies to improve them so that I am best serving students,"" she said."
274,274,"A look back at the original American campus sex scandal, and whose lives it actually changed

In the New Haven Evening Register of Jan. 18, 1960, on a back page near the weather report, ran two nearly identical articles on the exact same topic, the kind of mistake made by an editor on very tight deadline, or by an editor shaken by a disturbing story. The story in the left-hand column has the bureaucratic headline ""Officials Hold Conference on Probe at Yale."" The second story, five columns to the right, is titled ""Conference Due for Discussion of Yale Probe."" In each case, there is that word ""probe"" -- probe of what?

The left-hand article contains this lead: ""City Attorney Vincent Villano and Assistant City Attorney Gilbert Winnick will confer this afternoon in order to reach a decision as to whether warrants will be issued for a dozen Yale students involved in a morals case with a 14-year-old Hamden girl."" A Yale spokesman had confirmed that 10 sophomores and two juniors had ""resigned from school."" Yale's campus police chief had resigned from his post. In the one paragraph given over to the 14-year-old girl from Hamden (a middle-class suburb north of New Haven), we learn that she ""was arrested Friday and turned over to juvenile authorities for prosecution. She has since been placed in the custody of her parents, pending disposition of her case.""

On the same day, the Associated Press moved a wire story that was picked up by The New York Times. The AP story included news of the first arrests in the case: ""Three Yale undergraduates were arrested by New Haven police today in their investigation of a dormitory morals case involving a 14-year-old girl."" The AP story names the three men arrested, who, unlike the girl, were over the age of 18 and thus fair game for the press. ""Their bond was set at $500,"" the article reads, and a court appearance ""was set for Jan. 27."" The charge was ""lascivious carriage,"" which the Times called ""a charge used by the police in Connecticut to cover a variety of minor wrongdoings of a sexual nature.""

On Jan. 19, the Evening Register reported a plane crash in Virginia, a burglary on Church Street, and the latest information on the Yale case: New Arrests Expected in Yale Probe. The girl had identified three more students, according to the article.

""The alleged intimacies with the girl,"" the article read, ""are said to have occurred in Calhoun College, which she visited on two occasions, according to the police."" Yale is divided into twelve residential ""colleges,"" Gothic and Georgian dormitories built around courtyards. The first Register article had said that most of the students who had withdrawn had lived in Calhoun -- a college, like most of the others, where students live in suites of three or four students, in bedrooms organized around living rooms. To anyone who knew Yale, the dots were cohering into a picture of sex parties, in which friends or roommates passed around a young girl. That's not what happened, as it turned out, but at the time people thought all sorts of things.

Within days, multiple wire services were covering the case. A Jan. 19 story from the UPI, published in newspapers around the country on Jan. 20, brought the total number of arrests to six, the total number of suspects to 18, including the students who had already ""resigned"" from Yale. The same day, the Evening Register quoted a Yale official saying that the university would take no disciplinary action ""until the case is disposed of in City Court"" -- a statement that left unclear the status of the twelve students already gone from campus. Had they been expelled? They were already gone from the city, as it turned out, a fact that augured some embarrassment for Yale, which had let its boys slip away before the city could work up charges against them.

The front page of the Evening Register of Jan. 21 had nothing on Yale. But two days later, Yale returned to the news, in the Evening Register, The New York Times, and other newspapers, as an eighth student was arrested in what the Register, with an Eisenhower-era deafness to double-entendres, once again referred to as the ""morals probe."" The UPI story, which ran in the Chicago Daily Tribune and elsewhere, said that a ""14-year-old girl has identified at least 19 Yale University undergraduates as having been involved in immoral relations with her.""

The case disappeared from the news for several days, yielding space to topics like Ted Williams's contract for the 1960 season, New York housewife Jane Baldasare, who had spent 100 hours and three minutes underwater in a 9-foot-deep tank in Pensacola, Fla., suffering, according to the AP story, ""nothing worse than dishpan hands.""

Then, on Jan. 26, eleven more students were arrested; these students were among the twelve who had left town. ""The arrests total 19,"" the story continued. Police captain William F. Holahan ""said that all the students involved had been identified from their yearbook and then picked out of a line-up by the 14-year-old Hamden girl."" They were released on $500 bonds; trial was set for Jan. 27. Those arrested now included men from Pierson, Davenport, and Silliman Colleges, which tested the theory that this was some sort of Calhoun College sex ring.

During 10 days in January, the story was picked up by newspapers from Tucson to Abilene, from the Kane Republican in Kane, Pennsylvania, to the Las Vegas Daily Optic to the Denton Record-Chronicle in Denton, Texas. Time magazine, America's news source of record, ran a brief item about the ""14-year-old nymphet."" And then, on Jan. 27, it ended. That day, 20 Yale students, or ex-students -- it's not entirely clear how, or when, a twentieth student was caught in the dragnet -- appeared in a New Haven courthouse to plead no contest to charges of lascivious carriage.

According to the AP, some parents were present in the courtroom, which was ""crowded to its 300-person capacity."" The judge, Frederick L. Greenberg, accepted their pleas ""in an atmosphere heavy with embarrassment."" Four lawyers were present on various students' behalf, and they ""urged leniency, stating the youths had been subjected to 'shame and humiliation,' as well as the effect on the parents."" City attorney Vincent Villano helped the young men's case by stressing that ""actually no sexual intercourse occurred."" Seventeen of the men were sentenced to pay $25 fines, while three others were assessed $50. One of the men received the heavier fine ""because he was involved in a snowball throwing riot at Yale 10 months ago,"" a March event in which 42 students were arrested after attacking local police with snowballs.

The AP article did not mention the fate of the girl. The Times said only, ""The girl was not present. Her case is pending in juvenile court.""

***

The girl was named Suzi. It's not a fact I learned from any of the newspaper reporting at the time, all of which scrupulously concealed her name. Besides her age and hometown, all that can be learned of the girl from news reports is that she was a ""member of a highly respected family,"" as the AP wrote in its article on the sentencing. I knew her name was Suzi because many living people remember hearing that her name was Suzi. In that small, privileged world, in which Yalies had prep-school friends at the other Ivy League schools, and in which the men of these schools traveled to Smith, Mount Holyoke, and Wellesley to hunt for wives or just dates, Suzi's given name -- Suzi was Jewish, so I stop myself before writing ""Christian name"" -- was widely known.

The Ivy League press paid special attention to the case. Editors at the Cornell Sun, Columbia Spectator, and Harvard Crimson all covered the story, no doubt with a mix of gleeful schadenfreude and worried there-but-for-the-grace-of-God empathy. At the Harvard-Yale football game the following autumn, in November 1961, the Harvard band mocked the Yalies by playing some bars of ""If You Knew Susie (Like I Know Susie!),"" Eddie Cantor's chart-topping hit of 1925, which tells of a fun girl with morals not unlike those, it was presumed, of the 14-year-old girl from Hamden. On Nov. 8, 1963, two weeks before the assassination of one of its alumni would put more pressing matters in the newspaper, the Crimson ran an essay about the rules of dorm visitation written by Hendrik Hertzberg, now the executive editor of The New Yorker. ""Up until 1960,"" Hertzberg wrote, ""Yale's parietals were among the most liberal in the country, but the Suzy Affair changed things considerably.""

The name Suzi got passed down in Ivy lore -- and it's been mentioned to me by numerous ""Old Blue"" Yale alumni. The late chaplain William Sloane Coffin Jr., whose sermons brought civil rights and antiwar activism to Yale in the 1960s, told me about Suzi when I interviewed him in 1996, my senior year. Two years later, I met Kevin Buckley, Yale Class of 1960, who covered the Vietnam War for Newsweek; when I asked him how Yale had changed from his era to mine, we got around to sexual mores, and that quickly brought him to Suzi. In Make Love Not War (2000), his history of the sexual revolution, David Allyn devotes a page to ""a local 14-year-old girl named Susie [who] had become well-known on campus for her willingness to perform oral sex for any Yale student.""

Having heard about Suzi, from time to time, for 20 years, I lately found myself wondering about her. Over the past school year, as I read about the alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia, reported in the article that Rolling Stone famously had to retract; as I read about Columbia senior (now graduated) Emma Sulkowicz, who carried a mattress around campus to protest what she said was the school's mishandling of her sexual-assault case; and as I heard, from a Yale undergraduate woman I know well, how she was singled out by a fraternity for ridicule of a sexual nature, as part of their initiation of new pledges -- as I assimilated all these stories, with their complicated and tangled narratives, their resistance to full comprehension, their elusive truths, and their potential to live forever within all the involved parties, female and male, like unexploded mines that can be tripped years after graduation, I decided that I had to learn more about what happened to Suzi.

I was driven in part, I'll admit, by my reporter's simple amazement that not so long ago, before the internet, people carrying the label ""convicted sex offender"" could carry on, their names receding into the mists of time. The Yale students' names were in dozens of newspapers, after all. But after some time away, they had been allowed to return to Yale, and some even graduated on schedule. After graduation, no Google search had informed prospective employers about their criminal pasts, and they went on to lead lives of distinction: several architects, a doctor, a small-business owner, a painter. Wherever Suzi was, nobody knew where she had been. That's probably what she wanted, and she got it.

I wanted to understand how the actors saw things nearly five decades on. Suzie would be 69 or 70, the men five or six years older. I wondered if the men were remorseful, and I wondered if Suzi was vengeful. Did she feel abused by Yale and by a city that sees Yale as the company of its company town? Perhaps she had simply moved along. It occurred to me that maybe if you came of age before everyone talked about trauma, there was less of it. Perhaps -- I had to concede the possibility -- all of them had stoically gone on with their lives, their tactful friends and family making sure not to mention what had happened, no computers around to remind them, indulging a luxury that would never be permitted a college student today, still less a 14-year-old girl: the luxury of forgetting.

***

Nobody knows how the administration first heard about the 14-year-old Hamden girl paying visits to the residential colleges. An internal Yale memo, which I found in the papers of Yale President A. Whitney Griswold, shows that the school tightened visitation policies on Jan. 15, three days before the newspapers picked up the story. If Suzi visited campus multiple times, it's likely that some of her visits were in December, before the holiday break. Students talked, obviously -- one of them could have said something to a professor or a dean, either accidentally or after an attack of conscience. One theory was that Suzi's father somehow figured out that she'd been visiting Yale.

The snowball riot of the previous March was the latest act in a centuries-long drama of town-gown tension. News that Yale boys had been getting blowjobs from a townie -- a freshman townie -- was bad news indeed. It could have been worse: She could have been an Italian or Irish girl from New Haven proper, which would have been a ferocious species of kindling for the local anti-Yale element. Better, for local amity, that it was a middle-class Jewish girl from the suburbs. The respectable suburban Jews weren't likely to riot. Still, this was the kind of thing that Yale might want to cover up. The Yale Daily News insinuated as much in an editorial of Jan. 28, the same day the students' court appearance appeared on page 1. ""We are all too aware,"" read the editorial, ""that the principal concern of the deans and everyone involved in the investigation of the incident was to protect the careers and reputations of students who had, by their complete lack of judgment as shown by their actions, forfeited their right to any such consideration.

""Nevertheless,"" continued the editorial, mercilessly, ""no successful relationship can be maintained between Yale and the city of New Haven if the chief of New Haven police must be informed of Yale's 'hidden scandal' by an out-of-town newspaper of more than dubious journalistic reputation.""

I have not been able to track down the specifics of this charge -- the ""out of town newspaper"" that first brought the story to the city attorney's attention, nor the evidence that this is how the city learned about what happened. But this charge, along with the evidence that Yale knew what was happening before Jan. 15, suggests that Yale would have preferred to resolve the matter internally. It was not a paramount concern that the men who had received oral sex from an adolescent be prosecuted or even shamed. On this matter, it was left to their fellow students, including those on the newspaper, to be the university's conscience.

I tracked down Jim Ottaway, the chairman of the Daily News that semester, who probably wrote the editorial. We had a very chummy breakfast, during which we talked about his lifelong career in newspaper publishing. But he hardly remembered the Suzi case. I also sent an email to Lance Liebman, the student reporter who wrote some of the Suzi articles for the Daily News. He is now a professor at Columbia Law School and the school's former dean. ""There are hundreds of topics from my 73 years that I would be delighted to talk to you about,"" he wrote back to me. ""On this one, I have no memories whatsoever. I am not running away, just can't remember.""

The Suzi Affair disappeared from the news by the end of January 1960, but it remained a pressing matter for Yale President Griswold, whose mailbox continued to receive a steady stream of reminders about that dark month. ""God help you and Yale if you attempt to re-enroll ... any one of the 20 pigs,"" read one anonymous letter from Jan. 31. But that was the only letter, of perhaps two dozen to Griswold preserved in Yale's archives, that expresses any condemnation of the students. More numerous were the letters written to offer Griswold compassion and solidarity. ""Dear Whit,"" wrote Frank Altschul, Class of 1908. ""I know you well enough to realize how deeply you must have been hurt not only by the publicity but by the circumstances that occasioned it."" The president of Brown University, Barnaby C. Keeney, sent an encouraging note. ""Dear Whit: I am sorry about all the trouble you have been having lately. My sympathy is doubled by my realization that this sort of thing can and is likely to happen to a great many of us at any time.""

The general tone of these letters, assuring Yale's ongoing ""reputation"" and urging Griswold to stay ""amiable,"" was one that might be used to console a rower after a dishearteningly poor showing at a regatta. Other letters were mildly chastising, but toward Yale, not the boys. Louise and Jacob Rosenthal, ""parents of a Yale undergraduate,"" implored Griswold not to double down on the boys' punishment: ""We are deeply concerned lest the lives of otherwise very fine and worthy boys be seriously hurt by adding to their punishment by the state, the additional punishment of suspension."" Two women related to Yale alumni wrote with their concern that Yale, which had abolished compulsory chapel in 1926, had failed these boys by not offering proper moral instruction. ""It is undoubtedly true that the Chapel exercises should be restored and attendance should be made compulsory as in the former days,"" wrote Mrs. Catherine Tinker Patterson and Miss Corinne Babcock, in a joint letter of Feb. 3. ""When students are so lacking in morality ... it clearly shows that the emphasis on scholarship has far outweighed other values.""

But a greater share of the letters blamed Yale only insofar as it had allowed its fine young men to be caught in this adolescent girl's snare. The Rev. Matthew Warren, head of the prestigious St. Paul's School, whose charges then included future Secretary of State John F. Kerry, sent a note of concern. ""During the last few weeks,"" Father Warren wrote, ""I have read with distress the messy business of some Yale students and a very messy little girl."" Mrs. Gerald H. Castle, chairman of the board of Cincinnati's Waterman School, which according to its letterhead offered ""wardrobe design"" and ""charm"" classes for high-schoolers, wondered ""just where was the 14-year-old girl's mother and father while all this misconduct was taking place?"" J. Stanley Cohen, M.D., of Philadelphia, wrote a letter on Feb. 9 on behalf of one of the 20 Yale boys, the son of friends of his. ""This boy has always had an excellent reputation as an individual, a fine student and an athlete,"" Cohen wrote. ""Let us stop for a moment and compare these 20 boys with one young brat who on repeated occasions entered the dormitories of her own free will and spread confusion among a group of inexperienced, immature young men.""

Griswold's replies, several of which survive in the archives, are cordial and rather neutral; to the angriest letter-writers he offers no assent, just thanks for taking the time to write. Occasionally, he emits a quiet note of resignation. ""[T]he real solution lies in the moral fiber of the American family,"" he wrote to alumnus DeWitt Peterkin. ""It is there, in permissive parenthood, that most of this undergraduate amorality gets its start."" Only one reply has any teeth, and it was written not by Griswold but by Carlos F. Stoddard, an alumnus of the Class of 1926, who had returned to Yale to help oversee its public relations. Perhaps freer than the boss himself to play bulldog, Stoddard wrote to Mrs. Castle, the Cincinnati charm-school mistress, that the ""young woman involved in these distressing events is seriously unbalanced in certain respects.""

And then Stoddard offers a revelation that I think his boss, the circumspect Griswold, would have disapproved of, an accidental glimpse of the narrative on which the Yale administrators in Woodbridge Hall must have settled. ""Far from guarding her, or providing either counsel of psychiatric treatment,"" Stoddard wrote, ""her parents gave her a private telephone. This she used to call Yale students, seldom if ever indicating the true nature of her interest. She received many, many refusals to meet her, but 19 boys, most of them as young in years as they were lacking in judgment, did fall into what I think it is scarcely an exaggeration to call 'the trap.' "" It probably counts in Stoddard's favor that, in the end, he argued for compassion over contempt. He concludes his letter by saying that he feels ""more sadness for her than bitterness over the harm"" that she has caused. ""I can only hope the girl wins out and makes sense in the long run.""

***

Several of the newspaper stories from 1960 had listed the names and hometowns of the students. They were from towns like Wayzata, Minnesota; Columbus, Ohio; Rutherford, New Jersey; and Indiana, Pennsylvania. If one had to guess, most of the names belonged to white Protestants. A couple were German, one or two possibly Jewish. There was one ""Jr.,"" one ""III,"" and one ""IV"" (although the Times did not run the ""IV""). It would have been impossible to say much more about them.

But of the 20 men arrested for being with Suzi, I was able to find most of them. Two were dead. I tried to learn something about their lives. One of the dead men, Christopher Blaisdell, known in college as ""Jake,"" had never returned to Yale. When he died in 2009, a classmate published a recollection on a Class of '62 website: ""Jake was very southern California, into surfing and the casual lifestyle. He used Valley Girl speech before most of us knew anything about it. For example, he was the first person I ever heard use the word 'bitchin' to mean something very good, as in, 'There's bitchin' surf at Malibu today.' "" Jake eventually graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and then became a lawyer in Palm Springs. His family suggested that memorial contributions be given to Paws & Hearts, of Palm Desert or the Palm Springs Animal Shelter.

The other dead man, Stephen Sink, also never returned to Yale. He served in the Marines and then worked for his father's Coca-Cola bottling business in Indiana, Pennsylvania. At the time of his death, in 2007, he was the proprietor of the QuickPic and Laundromat. According to a man I'll call Sam, another one of Suzi's men, who'd stayed in touch with Stephen, he killed himself after he got so sick that he could no longer run his small convenience store. ""He didn't have big financial resources, and he had a little store, and he was alone,"" Sam said. ""He wanted to go into work, and he had a Marine background, a gun background. I actually saw him a week before, and he'd just found out he had cirrhosis. He had very little money, and he was negotiating with doctors for every bill.""

Of the remaining men, several did not return my phone calls, while three of them did talk to me, but only long enough to tell me never to call again. One of the men I found was too sick to talk. When I called his mobile phone, his wife answered. ""We're in the hospital,"" she said. ""He's dying of cancer."" She asked what my call was about, and I mumbled something about a Yale alumni matter, then hurried off the phone.

In the end, four of the men agreed to talk with me, provided that I conceal their names. I spoke with three by telephone, one in person.

I'll call one of them Frank. After Yale, he studied architecture, and he now runs a firm that designs and builds McMansions in a major Southern city. On the phone, he talked like a businessman, brisk and efficient, as if he had somewhere else to be. ""She knew my first name,"" Frank recalled, ""and when she gave that to the police, and when there were two other guys involved, who I was quite friendly with, they associated me."" When I asked what it felt like to be accused of such a crime, Frank said that it was ""shameful,"" but then he hedged that description. ""My family handled it pretty well,"" he went on. ""There was not a lot of weeping or wailing or cursing or swearing or anything like that. They had the attitude, 'This guy is such a wild man anyway, I am not surprised he was involved.' ""

That was pretty much Yale's attitude, too. ""We were thrown out,"" he said, ""and we were welcomed back. I took the time and went into the Army, served my two years there, came back, and was a much calmer, more studious person.""

I asked if people remembered the incident, ever brought it up.

""It wasn't a disgrace,"" Frank said. ""It wasn't like walking around campus with a big 'A' on your forehead. There were no issues. I continued to be involved in extracurricular things, like Glee Club, a singing group. Everything was back to normal.""

I asked if he knew what became of Suzi.

""I have no idea,"" he said. ""She was a very deranged little girl.""

""Did you regret what you did?"" I asked.

""Yeah,"" he said. But only ""the shame of it, getting caught. ... The act itself -- it was just a sexual act, nothing new. None of us were virgins. ... Nobody assaulted her or asked her to do anything she didn't want to do.""

***

""What can I say?"" said Campbell (as we'll call him), whom I reached by telephone. ""It was a sad thing. It was a really sad thing.""

Of the men I located, Campbell is the one I'd most like to be friends with, I think. Like Frank, he went to architecture school, but his interest is urban planning, which he has taught and written a book about. He's spent his life trying to improve neighborhoods and revitalize cities, in part by getting cars out of people's way. His first job in architecture was during the semester he was suspended from Yale, before he was readmitted.

""This was a young girl who was going around campus giving blowjobs,"" Campbell said. ""Nobody knew anything about her. The rumor was she visited 800 guys. I am sure that was off by a factor of 20 or something. ... The word was, she was going to somebody's room in one of the colleges. So I went over there, stupidly, in the middle of the afternoon. It sounded like a great idea. She started to take my pants down, and she had her underwear on, and I decided it wasn't a good idea. I don't think I ever touched her.""

Campbell said that they had a conversation and that he suggested she get some help. ""It was evident to me as soon as I met her that she was a little confused. And she was young."" Some time later, she called him on the telephone in his room. ""She wanted to chat,"" he remembered.

When he heard that men were being pulled before the administration, Campbell went to talk with William Sloane Coffin Jr., the university chaplain. He told Coffin that he was thinking he ought to turn himself in. ""I said, 'This is what I'm thinking about doing.' He heartily agreed, said that made sense."" He found a campus cop he knew and told the cop that he needed to talk to a dean about what was going on. ""The dean wanted me to implicate others, and I didn't really know anybody. I had a roommate involved. I didn't name my roommate.""

""It wasn't fun,"" Campbell said, summing up. ""But worse than that was having the Harvard side of the stadium singing, 'If You Knew Susie.' ""

***

""I always presumed it was the parents of the young woman"" who told the university, said the man we'll call David. He has retired from a long and lucrative career at a white-shoe investment bank, a place you've heard of. Of all the men I spoke with, he had suffered the most from the episode; his voice was jagged with pain.

""To be identified publicly as stupid, as we were, was not pleasant. My major regret is that I had a sister in high school that suddenly had her big brother in the newspapers in an unflattering way. ... I have always put in on my arrest record -- you fill out forms for employment -- I have always listed it because the worst case would be to be disclosed as hiding something.""

At the time, he had a serious girlfriend, who broke up with him when she heard the news. ""Long story, but I ended up marrying her,"" he said.

""She is now deceased. ... I don't know if other individuals had girlfriends at the time, but it caused a serious interruption in my relationship with that woman. We were married 20 years. But first, we were separated, married other people, partially as a result of this. We were then reunited, and together for maybe six years. And then I lost her to breast cancer.""

How, I asked, did he meet Suzi?

""She was calling around, just calling rooms on the telephone,"" he recalled. ""I don't even remember whether I picked up the phone or one of my roommates did. It wasn't anyone being really clever and hanging out in bars or on the street picking up women. She was calling and inviting herself over."" He remembered his picture being carried by one newspaper, taken after his arrest or arraignment. I haven't been able to find such a picture.

""They were arresting people for several days,"" David said. ""My parents retained an attorney for me ... and [my father] said, 'Tomorrow, you will go surrender to somebody.' I assume we were fingerprinted. I don't have any memory of it. I remember standing in the courtroom for a trial, all of us standing in a single line in the courtroom.""

After fall-term exams, which were then held in January, David went home to upstate New York, where he got a job in the supermarket where he'd worked the previous summer. I asked him if people at home knew why he was back. ""Oh, yes. If The New York Times put me on the front page, why wouldn't the newspaper there? I had a younger sister, and the high school was very protective of her.""

I wondered about his steady girlfriend, the one who left him after the story broke. Was it OK, back then, at all-male Yale, where all girlfriends were some distance away, to cheat on a steady?

""I didn't know if there were any rules or not. Sexual behavior was so much more restrictive at the time. ... It was just -- you won the lottery.""

***

Like Campbell, the man I'll call Sam also told me that he never actually received oral sex from Suzi. (Sam is the one who stayed in touch with Stephen Sink, who committed suicide in 2007.) Sam and I met in his small apartment in San Diego, where he had moved for the weather, and where he now spends his days painting with oils. After years of a marijuana addiction, he got sober in 1982. He is unmarried and he rarely sees his son, who lives in Washington, D.C. He is a follower of Kirpal Singh, the Indian guru who died in 1974, and every day he tries to talk with a few other followers, on the telephone, in virtual community.

When I visited him last winter, Sam served me a glass of water, and we sat in his small living room, the door of his small second-floor rental open to the warm California air. Sam told me that he was from a Jewish family, which put him in a small minority at Yale. ""I was in the closet as a Jew at Yale,"" he said. ""I wasn't saying I wasn't a Jew, but you know, I wasn't volunteering it."" I asked how he met Suzi, and he gave me an answer that, if true, meant that Suzi may have been visiting campus all fall, from August through December. It began in football season, he said -- before football season, in fact.

""I got invited back to the varsity camp before the season starts,"" he said. ""And I think it was at that time, there was a couple of friends of mine who were on the team, they told me about Suzi, that there was this girl who was -- the story I heard was that she was jacking guys off in a car. And, so, I -- my eyes lit up. I mean, this is the addiction kind of thing. I know now that I'm kind of a reckless person. ... I heard this woman was doing this, and this excited me, even though I was in love"" -- with his high-school girlfriend, two years younger, back in Illinois. ""It didn't even occur to us, this idea of being true to your girlfriend. We looked at the sexual thing as, I don't know, you got as much as you wanted or needed.""

They made a date, and Suzi came to Sam's room in Yale's Pierson College. ""I remember making out with her, like kissing, standing up, in the room,"" he recalled. They began in his living room, and then he led her to his bedroom, where she undressed. ""I had no idea what I was doing. I was a virgin. I mean, I had no idea how to even go about it, sex, or what it was. I mean, the actual mechanics. I had done some pretty hot stuff with women, a couple girlfriends, but it wasn't real sex."" And so, with a naked girl on his bed, he couldn't go through with it. ""She immediately got dressed and left.""

Sam said he had no idea that she was visiting other men in their rooms, and he certainly wasn't part of any sex parties. ""I knew nothing about these guys in Calhoun, until at some point I was contacted by somebody, I don't know whom."" He never knew how the administration, or the New Haven police, got his name.

I asked Sam if he knew that Suzi was 14.

""No,"" he said. ""I didn't, really. I don't know. I probably, you know, knew she was a young girl. She honestly could have passed for 18, but for some reason I don't think it was a big issue. We just sort of felt entitled.""

Sam's conviction shadowed him, a little. He ran for president of DKE, his big-man-on-campus fraternity, but he lost, because of the taint of the Suzi affair, a friend told him. Then, after college, he was rejected for a job driving a cab; on the job application, he had responded truthfully about his plea for lascivious carriage. ""They turned me down, said that that meant sodomy, in New York,"" he recalled.

***

I called Jim Gambrill, who graduated from Yale in 1962, because I was curious how the scandal played out for students who were not caught up in it. I had already learned that two of the Yale Daily News reporters who worked on the story had little or no memory of it. Was that true for everyone? Did it loom that small? I knew Gambrill's daughter from my Yale days, and she was the kind of sane, sensible person who, one figures, would have a likable dad. So, when she popped up in my Facebook feed one day, a bell rang inside my head -- ""Isn't her dad an alumnus? I wonder what year."" 1962, it turned out. She put us in touch.

Gambrill, a retired lawyer and Episcopal priest, lives in Maine with his second wife. He speaks with the soft, attuned cadences of a pastor. He never met Suzi. But, as he tells it, she changed his life.

""Two of them were my roommates,"" Gambrill told me. ""I lost two roommates out of that deal."" One of them was Jake Blaisdell, the bitchin' Californian who tore out of town in his VW bus, never to return. The other was the man I've called Campbell, the urban planner. It surprised me, although perhaps it shouldn't have, that Gambrill, the roommate, the bystander, had the most vivid memories of all.

""I didn't get involved in it,"" Gambrill said. ""I am very thankful I didn't. I think what sticks in my mind is we all knew it was coming. I remember quiet conversations on the phone with this poor Suzi. And they couldn't wait to have this happen.""

When it was over, Gambrill and other men who had stayed away would make fun of the men who had been with Suzi. But for Gambrill, anyway, it wasn't funny, not really.

""It's one of the things I feel worst about,"" he said. ""It changed my life, in a way. I know in my heart that if I had told the two guys I roomed with that this was a bad thing, they probably wouldn't have done it. I always felt bad I didn't try to tell them. I felt I failed them. Nobody I know said anything about it beforehand, but afterward, we sort of ganged up on them. And afterward she went to her father, and all hell broke loose.""

Gambrill remembers a terrifying week on campus, arrests coming every couple of days.

""That was very ugly, them sweating, waiting to see what would happen to them,"" he said. ""For a lot of us, it really consumed us. ... Some double-digit number were involved in this thing, went out in the car with this girl and got their fellatio, for lack of a grosser word. This was over the course of two or three weeks or something. And it was a source of merriment at first, and 'Isn't this amazing this could happen?' and 'Wow, what a lucky break' to all of a sudden mockery and remorse.

""It was a bad time, a bad time. The worst part of my life. I wasn't really affected. But these poor guys had to go home. They were children, 18 or 19 years old. They didn't know what they were doing. And a 19-year-old now knows a shitload more than a 19-year-old in 1959.""

Gambrill seemed certain that he was no better than his friends. Just lucky, that's all. ""I think it was offered to me,"" he said, ""but I was sort of naïve -- a moralistic child, I suppose. Didn't appeal to me at all. I'm very glad I didn't do it. It wasn't any credit to me. Just that I was scared of my own shadow.""

As Gambrill remembers it, Jake was too upbeat a guy to spend much time second-guessing his actions -- ""Everything was 'cherry' or 'bitchin'' if it was good. He said that. He was not an introspective person."" Campbell, on the other hand, ""was haunted afterward."" He remembers sitting in their rooming suite, in Davenport College, while Campbell waited for his father to arrive, before the court appearance. ""I remember his father strutting up the path to the room, past the window ... and their shaking hands in a very somber way. He had been awake the whole night before, and he had said to me, 'Can you lend me some money so I can help pay for my father's trip?' I didn't have any money.""

Gambrill had entered college planning to be a lawyer, but the chaplain Coffin's Sunday sermons in Battell Chapel spoke to him, and they got him thinking about ministry. And the Suzi episode, his failure to stop his friends from going through with it, pushed him in that direction, too. ""This incident made me feel I was more connected with other people than I had acted on,"" he said, ""and maybe the way to go was to be a priest. So, I became an Episcopal priest and served in churches for 20 years.""

Gambrill said it was ""hard to relate"" to his college years now. It was a different time, so different. ""This was before Jack Kennedy was elected, let alone killed,"" he said. ""It was a very simple, sweet time.""

Was it better?

""Oh, God no. It's like going back to the Garden of Eden. I wouldn't ever want to go back. It had its sweetness, but it only looks that way looking back.""

***

Suzi hasn't gone by ""Suzi"" since her teenage years; before high school was out, she took a different first name, something a bit more exotic, less Betty Crocker. Then, when she got married, she took her husband's last name. And none of the old police notes or court records from her case have survived. So finding her might have been impossible, except for one bit of luck: Two of the men remembered what her full name had once been. I used a web search to turn up a little bit of information from the 1960s on a person with that name, and with that lead, I found a contact who helped me track her down. Today, Suzi lives far from New Haven, in a part of the country that's remote and beautiful.

We met in a local restaurant, where she kept telling me to keep my voice down. It's a small town, and while people know a lot about her, there is a lot they don't know. The men she once serviced would never recognize the blond, voluptuous teenager they knew. She is fat (that's the word she uses) and white-haired, and on the day we met, her eyes were swollen from an allergic reaction.

After we sat down and ordered, she said that she had looked on my website and read some of my writing. ""I noticed that you were Jewish,"" she said. I said yes, I'm Jewish. She said that as a child she'd loved Purim, the holiday where Jews are commanded to get drunk and make a lot of noise. She's not a big believer, she said, but she's gotten more observant in the past few years, and she was part of an informal group of Jews who met to celebrate the holidays, without much ritual but with a lot of spirit. ""As we say at our gatherings, 'They tried to kill us. We won. Now let's eat!' ""

We talked about dogs and cars. We talked about the landscape visible from the restaurant window. She talked about what she was like as a child: precocious, bookish, a reader by age 3. By puberty, she felt much older than the girls around her, both more intellectual and more sexual. ""Lots of hormones, you know?"" she said.

Suzi seldom thinks about the events of 1959 and 1960, she said. When asked about them, she sounds neither embarrassed nor traumatized. She's not especially proud of what happened, but she's not not proud. She does not agree with the men's assessment that she was crazy or disturbed. It's just that it was all a long time ago. And, more important, what happened then had very little bearing on the abundant life she's led since. Although she'd been a sexual adventurer from a young age, she had proceeded through life, it seemed, with a rather old-fashioned, pre-Freudian attitude about childhood: you put it behind you, forged ahead, never looked back, kept living hard. Forgetfulness was a useful habit of resilience. Time remembering was time wasted.

""OK,"" she said. ""At the age of 14, I monopolized the family telephone. And so for my 14th birthday, they gave me my own phone, with my own number, which was in my bedroom. And I started making phone calls. I don't know why. I went to the phonebook, and at that time, you could tell where people lived -- Davenport College, Calhoun, whatever the things were."" This much was true. Even in the 1990s, when I was at Yale, our dormitory phone numbers were listed in the New Haven Whitepages. ""It was kind of random -- 'Oh, this person lives there,' and I'd call them up.

""And they'd talk to me. They'd ask me how old I was, and I told them 16."" She said that she gave them a fake name, an Italian-sounding name. ""I'm fat now -- it's because I don't exercise, it doesn't bother me -- but when I was 14, I was beautiful, long blond hair, curves. And I was very sexual. And I went and hung out there. I never stayed over. And nothing was ever done to make me feel bad. I would remember that, believe me -- I wouldn't have gone back ...

""I don't even know how long this went on. A couple months, I guess. It's all a purple haze there.""

She said ""there was no intercourse,"" but ""there were other things. I had a good time. And yes, I had to lie to my parents. But, teenagers do that."" The specific lie was that she was going to the orthodontist. ""I had braces. I could tell them I had a long orthodontist appointment."" Or she told them she had a choir practice. She took the bus into downtown New Haven, during the day and then came back by nightfall.

Like the men I'd spoken with, she wasn't really sure how Yale, or the police, had found her story. It was not, as some of the men believed, that she had told her father.

""What I was told was that one of the people confessed to his priest or whatever and that it was passed on,"" she said. She didn't remember being arrested, exactly. The police got her and took her to ""juvy hall"" to scare her straight. She was required to see a psychiatrist. And her relatives were horrified. But she had little regret, then or now. ""I was not a victim,"" she said. ""I pursued these people. It was easy. They said, 'Come over,' and I did ... My whole life, I was sexually free.""

During her teenage years, Suzi saw a series of therapists. At one point, she worked with a doctor who had her attend group therapy sessions. ""And he got mad at me because I'd seduced one of the other people in that group,"" she said. ""You weren't supposed to do that.""

Suzi's main regret was how her behavior affected her father, whom she was very close to, and who died when she was 16. ""I was a wild child, and that didn't tame me -- when he passed away, I was just crazier. He and I were very close, and he was disappointed -- I think that would be the word -- in what had happened."" Her mother was less forgiving. ""I think she was kind of aghast,"" Suzi said. ""She didn't know what to do. You know, she died a few years ago. We came to peace. We were friends."" Her mother, she said, came to love her husband, although it took many years. At the time of her wedding, Suzi and her family were estranged. ""I wasn't talking to my family at that point. So none of them came to my wedding.""

""Why not?"" I asked.

""Because I was the -- I wouldn't say the 'black sheep.' I was the whole herd.""

Because of what had happened at Yale?

""Oh, just in general. That was part of it. 'Bad influence.' ""

Suzi didn't slow down during her teenage years. One time, she was hauled in by the police after being caught with a boy in a car on the beach in Westport, Connecticut, a half-hour's drive from New Haven. ""Public beach, no clothes, this guy and I,"" she recalled. ""And all of a sudden this big light comes on from the sheriff. Oh boy! He made us get dressed, and then he called my mother ... Our stupid mistake was we threw beer cans out the window, and they saw the beer cans.""

After leaving the Hamden school district, Suzi attended a boarding school for a little while, where she got kicked out. Her father threatened to send her to a convent school in Vermont (he was ""half kidding""); she agreed to behave and ended up graduating from the public high school in the town where her family had moved right after her encounter with the law; it was only a couple dozen miles away, still in Connecticut, but in that era, a little distance meant a fresh start.

During high school, Suzi worked briefly for Yale. ""I did LSD experiments on animals,"" she said. After graduation, Suzi tried college, ""several"" of them. ""I enjoyed it up to a point,"" she said. But she got in trouble and was expelled from not one but two schools. ""Promiscuity,"" she said, when I asked why. ""Seriously.""

""Well done,"" I said.

""Hey, yeah! I had a good time. I was a good student, but I did what I wanted to do."" She paused for dramatic effect. ""Hopefully some of those guys remember me fondly.""

She moved to Spain for a year, then under the Franco dictatorship, which mattered not at all if you were a tourist, she said. Plenty of fun to be had. ""Wild scene there,"" she said. ""Tons of dope, and as a young blond woman -- are you kidding? I had a good time."" She traveled around Europe, ending up in Greece. She came home, but she couldn't stick around New Haven. One of her cousins told her that something was happening in San Francisco. ""I took the bus,"" she said, ""went out to Haight Street, and that was that."" It was 1967. ""Summer of Love. Fantastic place."" For a time, she said, she lived at 1090 Page St., the famous Victorian house in the Haight owned by Rodney Albin, older brother of Peter Albin, the guitarist for Big Brother and the Holding Company, known for its work with Janis Joplin. ""You paid rent every month, and I paid in marijuana. Downstairs in the house had been a big ballroom. Big Brother and the Holding Company and Janis, they'd practice downstairs. Jerry Garcia would dance."" After she left 1090 Page, she moved elsewhere in the Haight, to a house in the Panhandle district. ""And Jimi Hendrix and the Dead and other people would give free concerts right outside our window.""

Her reminiscences went on: a fight with Bill Graham, the concert promoter; how things went bad in the Haight, when the ""bad drugs"" moved in; but mainly, how wonderful things were before they went bad. ""It was perfect without thinking about it,"" she said. ""When you walked down the street, you never thought anybody was going to bother you.""

One day, Suzi was reading the Berkeley Barb, the old underground paper, when a personal ad got her attention. The paper ""was famous for its ads, most of which were sexual,"" she said. ""This one was not a sexual ad. He was going to San Francisco State ... 21-year-old male historian, and he underlined male, desires female companion who likes Ruben and the Jets"" -- an early Frank Zappa band -- ""dining at Xan Wo's, in Chinatown in San Francisco, and camping in the real outdoors."" She called the number in the ad, and it was busy. She called again and got through to the man who'd placed the ad. ""And he insists, years later, that I said to him, 'If you have anything to do with speed, methamphetamines, hang up now.' ""

He didn't have anything to do with speed, and they had their first date at the zoo at Ocean Beach, in San Francisco. ""We got married a year later,"" Suzi said. ""And we have no secrets. He knows everything about my life and vice versa."" They have been together 45 years, and their life has been filled with joy and adventure. She is a devoted wife to a man who returns her love. To earn money, Suzi has worked as a translator and has authored guidebooks for travelers. She has also published poetry. She and her husband never wanted children, never had any. She subscribes to The New Yorker, Mother Jones, and Smithsonian. They have lived in Guatemala, Nepal, and the Mexican state of Oaxaca.

Suzi sounded sad only when she talked about her family, whom she might have liked to see more of. For years, she said, anytime one of her siblings, or even one of her cousins, messed up, somebody attributed it to Suzi's example. ""Anything that happened, it was me. Bad influence."" She kept in touch with her younger sister, who told her what the family said about her. ""She wanted to come to my wedding,"" Suzi said of her sister. ""She was 14 when I got married."" Their mother wouldn't let her go.

***

Of course, there are huge differences between what happened to Suzi (if that's even the way to put it) and what Emma Sulkowicz, the mattress-hefting Columbia graduate says happened to her; and still more of a gap between the story I've just written, which is entirely true, and the Rolling Stone story about rapes at the University of Virginia, which the magazine retracted after large portions of it were shown to be false. I don't mean that there are perfect analogies. I'm only suggesting that sex scandals predate the co-ed campus, predate the 1960s, predate even the modern American university. And that maybe by looking at how earlier eras reacted to such events, we can learn something about how far we have come, and how far there is to go.

In 1642, ""lascivious carriage,"" the charge brought against the Yale boys, was made a crime by the General Court, or legislature, of Connecticut. Because other laws dealt with bestiality, homosexuality, adultery, and rape, lascivious carriage seems to have been intended as a ""residual"" charge, capturing lewd stuff that other laws didn't capture. An 1811 court decision clarified that the law was meant to suppress acts ""flowing from the exercise of lustful passions, which are grossly indecent and unchaste; and which are not otherwise punished as crimes against chastity and public decency."" In other words, if an unmarried man and a woman do something together that is consensual but that strikes proper folk as going a bit too far, they might be guilty of lascivious carriage. Hand-holding and mild petting on the porch swing? Probably OK. Sixty-nine? Anal? Oral? Lascivious carriage.

This legal-historical explanation doesn't get us very far into some of the questions I wanted answered. For example: Why were the boys not charged with statutory rape? (Possible answers: There was no intercourse; Suzi would not have been a sympathetic witness; a jury, eager to spare these Yale boys a criminal record, might not have convicted.) Better still: Why was Suzi taken into custody, and what for? Nobody seemed to have a good answer for that one.

I expected to find an angry older woman, her voice shaky as she recounted the myriad men who had used her for play; or perhaps a moody, reflective introvert, finally at peace after a lifetime of fragility. Instead, I met a contented, energetic woman, a model of late-in-life baby-boomer vigor, proud of her adventurous past, who seemed to believe that what she'd done in 1959 would have been the perfect caper if only her parents and the police had remained clueless. Where I had expected to find a story about white male privilege, what I found instead was something else.

Was Suzi's story, in fact, a missive from an earlier, and in some ways more civilized, time? After all, if Suzi's story broke today, her name would be public knowledge, omitted by the most reputable news organizations but easily available to anyone with Google, including future employers. Every boss, every potential date on eHarmony.com, and every neighbor who bothered to check up on where the registered sex offender in their ZIP code lived -- they'd all know everything, about everyone involved. There would be no going back. No early release for time served. No second chances.

Most of the people I have told about Suzi are sure that she was ""seriously unbalanced,"" to borrow the words that dripped from the pen of Carlos Stoddard, President Griswold's aide. And maybe she is, or was; it is important to remember that she was only 14, and the men involved were only slightly, if significantly, older, and still in school. All we can know is that she is a secure, unrepentant woman, in a longer, more stable marriage, as far as I can tell, than any of the men I talked to who were arrested for being with her. Insofar as she thinks about her mental state, she judges herself to be well.

""I'm kind of 'be here now,' "" Suzi said to me, just before I got in my rental car and drove off. ""You can say, 'Yes, I'm happy I did that.' Or, 'I'm happy I went somewhere.' Or, 'I'm happy I met someone.' But it's a characteristic of mine -- I'm here, it's a beautiful day, let's enjoy.""

275,275,"Meteorologists usually enlist the help of a huge supercomputer when they run their weather models. Chances are that supercomputer is one made by Cray, a global supercomputing company based in Seattle, Washington.

""So when you watch 'The Today Show' and you see the machine that predicts weather for a continent, that's usually a Cray doing that. When you check the weather on your phone, there's a really good chance the information came from a Cray,"" said Ted Slater, Cray's Global Head of Healthcare and Life Sciences.

Increasingly, more advanced computing tools are making their way into the healthcare sector, as hospitals and medical professionals try to bring data to bear to treat patients more efficiently, develop drugs more quickly, and generate more effective therapies for diseases like cancer. That's how healthcare fits into the nuts and bolts of Slater's job: The bass player who has a background in molecular biology and computer science talks to organizations and individuals doing scientific and medical research with computers, and then figures out if one of Cray's products, like a supercomputer, might help advance their research. How exactly this type of technology is changing the medical field was the subject of an interview Slater gave during MedCity's recent CONVERGE conference in Philadelphia.

Before we get to healthcare, let's back up to the meteorology point, because I think that'll be relevant. What's a supercomputer got to do with telling me whether it's going to rain?

When you're predicting weather, what you're working with is a really big mathematical model you need to churn through really fast in order to turn it around in time to make a reasonable weather prediction. That's what Cray does really well.

And churning through data fast matters to healthcare because?

The reasons are legion. But really, it's generally recognized that big data is out there to stay and it just keeps getting bigger all the time. Life sciences are the biggest of the big data -- healthcare and life sciences sets the standard for the kinds of data that comes in. And in healthcare, where we're dealing with millions and millions of patients and all kinds of sensors and technologies ... you generate enormous amounts of data. And there's an enormous variety of ways to use those data. For example, at a major pharmaceutical company, you might be very interested in modeling in three dimensions over time what it looks like when a putative drug molecule binds to a target in a biological system. Well that's all done mathematically, and typically it's a mathematical model similar to a weather model.

I see. So, technology enables that sort of 3D representation, for instance. But that's just one way computing is growing in the healthcare field.

The really big thing is precision medicine ... It turns out it's really important to know what a patient's genome looks like. What's the particular complement of mutations that they have that defines their disease and defines how they're going to respond to treatment? That's obvious from the sequencing itself. Next-generation sequencing, that's the way you generate those data. And it's an enormous amount of data, all of which has to be analyzed in certain ways to generate a picture of a patient [for a physician] to recommend appropriate treatment.

And something like a Cray supercomputer can do this because they have machine learning capabilities?

Any computer can do the deep learning stuff. The difference would be that you can run these kinds of things faster on a supercomputer. ... It can help researchers explore their data and make scientific decisions rather than waiting their computation to end.

Why is that important?"

A Monmouth County program aims to inspire healthy eating in school-aged kids by teaching them about the local agricultural industry. Susanne Cervenka | Wochit

CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE

I have been passionate about weight loss and weight management since his medical school and clinical training at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, Columbia University and Yale University.

Early in my studies, I was struck by how much damage carrying excess weight can do to the body - and the person's quality of life. Over time, obesity will probably shorten your lifespan by years - not months.""

I focus on very overweight people who are at the highest risk of weight-related heart disease, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, stroke, high blood pressure and cancer.

Q. Why has New Jersey's adult obesity rate more than doubled in the past 20 years?

A. For starters, New Jerseyans are consuming a greater calorie load with too much sugar and not enough nutrition, especially in terms of protein. Another big challenge is portion distortion. Overall, the general population is performing less physical activity because many people's favorite exercise is tinkering on their phones or sitting at their computers.

More: Five ways to boost your metabolism

Q. When it is time to seek obesity treatment?

A. When weight begins to limit your participation in daily life - sports, parties and special events - even trips to the amusement park because you fear you may not fit on the rides - it is time to seek help.

Many people have independently tried diets and exercise programs but have not achieved or sustained success. While the desire to lose weight was sincere, the outcome was not achieved. When this is the case, it is time to partner with an obesity medicine specialist who can develop a multi-pronged solution that may include working with a doctor, nutritionist, fitness trainer and psychologist.

More: Weight-loss surgery runs in the family

As a surgeon who specializes in weight loss surgery, my patients often come to see me after they are diagnosed with weight-related chronic medical conditions that require expensive medications, frequent doctor visits and even hospitalization.

I would rather treat patients who have a large amount of weight to lose but are not impeded by multiple medical issues that can limit or even make some treatment options impossible due to risk.

Q. What do obesity medicine doctors do?

A. Obesity is often a chronic disease that affects the whole family. This multi-generational health risk usually requires individualized support and guidance from obesity professionals who are specially-trained to help Mom and Dad's weight problem -- as well as Grandma and even the children's weight challenges.

More: Is the 'hunger hormone' ruining your diet?

We're seeing more medical school training in patient obesity diagnosis, counseling and treatment. This is a huge milestone, which helps family doctors bring up the subject of weight in a manner that is not offensive to the patient, but more treatment-oriented.

Q. Is it true that some people are genetically disposed toward obesity?

A. If you have one parent who is obese, that increases your risk of obesity to 50 percent; if both parents are obese, that rises to 80 percent. The next time you are eating at a restaurant, look around at families dining together; you will see confirmation of this fact.

Even if you are at high risk for the disease of obesity, you can significantly modify genetic risk through diet and exercise.

Q. What are the top five weight loss/management tips you recommend to patients?

1. Plan healthy, protein-rich meals in advance. Grocery shop more often if necessary.

2. Add exercise to your calendar every day, just like a dentist appointment.

3. 7/7: Sleep on a regular schedule seven days a week; aim for seven hours of quality rest.

4. Drink 64 ounces of water every day.

5. Get rid of the sugar in your food and your beverages.

Q. Any other weight loss recommendations?

A. Obesity is a disease, just like diabetes.

If you have tried multiple diet and exercise programs and have not achieved your weight loss goal, it's time to connect with a healthcare professional to talk about options that suit your current health, weight loss needs and lifestyle.

279,279,"5G is creating an environmental nightmare in more ways than technology addicts even can imagine!

Since 5G waves don't travel very far, innovative 'cell towers' of all shapes, types and sizes -- including that of a refrigerator size -- most likely will be 'planted' on a pole of some sort outside most buildings, including your home!

5G cell towers are noisy suckers, too, as they contain fans to keep them cool! Another fire hazard like AMI Smart Meters? Just imagine ""whirl, whirl, whirl"" all night long outside your bedroom window sending EMF radiation along with that constant droning noise! And you can't stop it!

[1]

According to San Francisco, California, City Planner Omar Masry, a large cabinet ""the size of a refrigerator, with noisy cooling fans for the computers, may be mounted a few feet from a bedroom bay window in a dense area of town."" Can you imagine sleeping every night with that noise and electrosmog pollution?

Below is what's called an ""Unsecured H-frame mounted small cell."" Can it fall over, and how secure is it, if it's not secured?

[1]

How about something like this pumping EMF radiation directly into your house? What will individual cell towers do to property values? Forget that! What will they do to human health? Frankly, no studies have been done on 5G and the FCC should be taken to task for pushing 5G cell tower installation, in my opinion.

This FCC 5G irresponsibility reminds me of the Monsanto 90-day studies saying GMOs were safe, when they are not according to life-cycle rat studies [7] on rats feed GMO corn. Furthermore, the active ingredient in GMO agriculture-glyphosate -- is found contaminating everything: food, ground water, and even vaccines [3]. What kind of BS is the 'consensus science' promoted by microwave professional associations? Isn't there anyone with common horse sense in government agencies, either?

[1]

Health advocates and residents of New York State -- Manhattan, in particular -- ""are targeting Gov. Cuomo and the New York Dept. of Conservation, which is considering rule-making that would exempt from environmental review projects on existing structures including those with no transmitters."" [1]

[1]

With all the high-rise buildings and towers in NYC, residents there will be in grave danger health wise since people now are becoming electromagnetically hypersensitive (EHS) due to excessive exposures to and interactions with high tech, microwave tech-driven devices everyone seems to think can't hurt you. The ""hurts"" are scientifically documented as ""non-thermal radiation"" adverse health effects. Here are the last statistics I have about EHS:

26% of the USA population (Caress & Steinemann, 2003)

19% of the Swedish population (Johansson et al, 2005)

27% of the Danish population (Berg et al 2008)

32% of the German population (Hausteiner et al, 2005) [2]

Once a person becomes EHS life is never the same. Ask the folks who had to move to Green Bank, West Virginia, in order to be able to ""live"" half-way normally again! EHS is questioned by the media and all who are part of the 'consensus science' clan, which decrees their 'science' as 'factual' by personal belief rather than what scientific methods and tests indicate.

Here's an example: 32% of microwave-industry-funded studies found non-thermal radiation adverse effects and yet, that industry's prime professional association, ICNIRP, continues to promote that no such things exist! How patently stupid can anyone be? The very fact their industry research found 32% of non-thermal radiation adverse events [4] obviously PROVES they exist, and yet ICNIRP is regarded as the 'ultimate' in microwave industry expertise, resulting in government agencies being hoodwinked and ballyhooed by what basically is real fake science!

Listen to what Martin Blank, PhD, [5] says about the risks of getting any type of cancer from cell towers! Furthermore, would you want a 5G cell tower outside your home or bedroom window, which can interfere with your brain's ability to produce the hormone melatonin [6]?

Dr. Martin Blank Cell Towers and Cancer / BioInitiative Report

Probably no one is as well-versed in what's going on regarding ""full spectrum dominance"" using EMFs and high tech electromagnetics as researcher and author Elana Freeman, who contacted me recently about my articles regarding 5G. In an email Ms. Freeman referred to us as ""sisters in arms,"" something I greatly value.

Take in what Elana has to say, as she knows what she's talking about, which needs to be mainstreamed. Note what she says about man-made clouds using electromagnetics and the 'scientific' Latin names given to them. Toward the end of this video, Elana explains what 5G will do! You don't want to miss that information!

For those who can't read the chart on the timeline regarding implementation of certain weather modifications by 2025, when the Air Force intends to 'own' the weather, here are those factors on a projected timeline:

Now 1996 (when the report ""Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025"" was written by the Air Force dated August 1996)

Now, can you understand why we are having such erratically different weather patterns globally? Also, are you aware that certain vested interests are gaining financially from what's called ""disaster economics""?

Is faster Wi-Fi and getting clearer Netflix really worth it? Or, are humans destined to become controlled ""bots"" [8] run and operated by all the high tech EMF devices they now are addicted to? Don't believe that? Go back and re-listen to what Elana Freeman says about all the aluminum, etc. being dumped into the atmosphere and the reasons for that.

US stock indexes hold steady after back-to-back down weeks

NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stock indexes were little changed Monday, holding relatively steady following back-to-back losses for the Standard & Poor's 500 index over the last two weeks. The S&P 500 is close to its lowest level in six weeks, but this week may be a calmer one for stocks with few market-moving events approaching on the calendar. The week's highlight will likely arrive as the weekend approaches, when central bankers from around the world gather in Wyoming.

289,289,"Did you know you can build fundamental circuits using biological methods? These aren't your average circuits, but they work just like common electrical components. We talk alot about normal silicon and copper circuits 'roud here, but it's time to get our hands wet and see what we can do with the power of life!

In 1703, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz published his Explication de l'Arithmétique Binaire (translated). Inspired by the I Ching, an ancient Chinese classic, Leibniz established that the principles of arithmetic and logic could be combined and represented by just 1s and 0s. Two hundred years later in 1907, Lee De Forest's ""Audion"" is used as an AND gate. Forty years later in 1947, Brattain and H. R. Moore demonstrate their ""PNP point-contact germanium transistor"" in Bell Labs (often given as the birth date of the transistor). Six years later in 1953, the world's first transistor computer was created by the University of Manchester. Today, 13,086,801,423,016,741,282,5001 transistors have built a world of progressing connectivity, automation and analysis.

While we will never know how Fu Hsi, Leibniz, Forest or Moore felt as they lay the foundation of the digital world we know today, we're not completely out of luck: we're in the midst's of our own growing revolution, but this one's centered around biotechnology. In 1961, Jacob and Monod discovered the lac system: a biological analog to the PNP transistor presented in Bell Labs fourteen years earlier. In 2000, Gardner, Cantor, and Collins created a genetic toggle switch controlled by heat and a synthetic fluid bio-analog2. Today, AND, OR, NOR, NAND, and XOR gates (among others) have been successfully demonstrated in academic labs around the world.

But wait a moment. Revolution you say? Electrical transistors went from invention to computers in 6 years, and biological transistors went from invention to toggle button in 40? I'm going to get to the challenges facing biological circuits in time, but suffice it to say that working with living things that want to be fed and (seem to) like to die comes with its own set of challenges that aren't relevant when working with inanimate and uncaring transistors. But, in the spirit of hacking, let's dive right in.

My First BioCircuit™

Following the Composition Model (even though the Network Layer Model might be preferred), I'm going to go through the construction of a simple oscillator through electronic and biological methods. The goal is by the end you know a bit more about biological circuits, what they're made of, what they can do and why they're hard to make.

DNA/Physical Makeup

In electronics, we make our parts (for the most part) out of copper, silicon, and epoxy. In biology, the base parts are strands of DNA3. For this reason, if you need a quick refresher on DNA, take it. But, all you must know for this article is that DNA encodes genetic information.

Part List: Protein Expression Mediated Logic

For our oscillator, we're going to need three inverting gates. In the electronics world, that's pretty easy (like $0.06 easy). You can make electronic logic gates out of (almost) anything and there are countless resources detailing every... intricate... detail that any sane person would want to know.

The biological world has its fair share of logic gates, some of which we've already covered. We're going to focus on the most common type: protein expression mediated logic. Through this method, protein concentrations are treated as signal and are used just like electrical signals are. Below is a genetic NOT gate, signal A (a specific protein for the Promoter or ""input"") inhibits the output of signal B (the protein that the ""Gene of Interest"" codes for). This works just like a traditional NOT gate, if there is not signal A, then produce signal B. Well, it works almost the same way as a traditional NOT gate. This is where we find one of the great challenges that synthetic biology faces: orthogonality.

In electrical logic, we don't usually need to worry about orthogonality, as we can connect the output of a NOT gate to what we want (and only what we want) with wires and/or traces. In biology, we don't usually have this luxury as we're working in prokaryotes (cells without nuclei) which can be effectively thought of as bags of chemicals4 So, instead of having direct connections from one gate to another, we only have one signal ""net"" as part of our network.

Computers have this figured out with identifiers like MAC addresses. For example, if Bob wants to send a message to Sue, he might broadcast something like ""FOR: SUE, MESSAGE: HI"". This works out great for computers: they craft their own receivers and transmitters. In code and hardware, it can be trivial (that's part of the reason why we have so many electronics communication standards ) but, in biology protein engineering is hard, and it takes time, ingenuity and labor.

Imagine that you could only use one type of transistor in each project. As an example, consider that if you used two 2N3904s, you turn both on or off, but never one off and one on. Now, pretend that for each transistor, you had to corner a computer in the wild, disassemble it and hand remove all of its components in the hopes of finding a new type of transistor. Surely, that would make creating a computer with 30 billion transistors, in one word, difficult.

As such, practically all of the promoters5 (input sites, coded in DNA) that are used today were originally discovered in nature and have been adapted for synthetic use. And, we've been pretty successful at this, with enough usable promoters that we need a catalog to sort them all out6.

Device Built with NOT Gates

Now, ever forward. Let's try to build a device with our NOT gates. And, as we're really just here to learn concepts, I'm going to show you how to create a ring-oscillator. If you're a bit rusty on your terminology, or you've been too busy to bother with a 100 level circuits class, no worries. A ring-oscillator is really simple, which is why it was one of the first bio-oscillators made. Ring-oscillators are made by placing an odd number of inverters (usually greater than 1) in a cycle (ring). See below for a very cool gif™ that hopefully should clear up any doubts about how it works. But, if things aren't crystal clear, Enrique from MITx has your back.

Now for the bio part. We already have our NOT gates, so surely we can string three identical NOT gates together and end up with an oscillator, right? Well, as we covered earlier, we'll need to use three different gates, so things look like three NOT gates in parallel, rather than in series. But, even with three different NOT gates, we might have another problem: death.

After all, all our logic is taking place in a cell using up resources and producing a ""useless"" protein. And, by the very nature of cells, there's a limit to the number of resources a cell has. We can try to improve our cell's effective throughput, but at some point, we need to realize that the cell, as greedy as it is, must take care of the basic requirements of life. However, fear not. Our three gate oscillator should be sustainable7. But, if we were to try seven or even nine gate oscillators we might need to start worrying.

Anyway, enough dilly dallying. We've put our DNA sequences together, introduced them into a cell and now we wait for them to grow8. We've used GFP (a Green Fluorescent Protein) as one of our ""signals"" so we can visualize our signal (just like one would use an LED to view a digital signal).

And... nothing. At first. After about 160 minutes our cells start to glow. Just like electronic ring-oscillators, our frequency depends on the delay time of each NOT gate. In electrical contexts, this gives us frequencies commonly in/above the kHz range. In biology, we're working at a blazing fast 1×10[-4] Hz with a period of ~160 minutes. Again, another stark difference between biological and electrical circuits.

In Practice / Why You Should Care

Okay, I know how it seems. Biological Logic is underdeveloped, slow and constrained by life. But, there is a harmony! What biology lacks, it makes up for in immeasurable ways. After all, we're made of cells, not silicon.

From regulating transgene expression for regenerative medicine to a tunable dual-promoter integrator for targeting of cancer cells, cellular logic has the opportunity to change the way we think about how medicine should work, what we think life is and whether or not plant's should glow. You should care because it's cool it's new and it has the potential to help lots of people. We're hackers. We've always been at the forefront of technology, and just because this one's squishy things don't need to change. So, let's get hacking!

I really enjoy writing about synthetic biology, as you might have guessed, so let me know if there are any topics that y'all would like to hear about. Would a few ""Getting Started"" articles on, well, getting started in synthetic biology with actionable procedures be a good place to start?

Notes

[1] Calculated using the figures from the Forbes Article ""How Many Transistors Have Ever Shipped?"". While I have little confidence in this article, I am willing to believe that the figure presented is accurate to at least a few orders of magnitude. Regardless, the exact number is less important than the overall impression that many transistors surround us today.

[2] Specifically, the E. Coli was controlled by Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) which is a molecular mimic of allolactose, a lactose metabolite. IPTG is used because, unlike allolactose, IPTG is not hydrolysable by β-galactosidase, so its concentration remains constant as it's not broken down as readily.

[3] Okay, yes: DNA is made of nucleotides but copper is made of atoms and we have to stop somewhere. In our context today, it makes sense to stop at DNA, but in other contexts, such as DNA synthesis, DNA clearly isn't the base unit.

[4] To say that cells are just ""bags of chemicals"" is a gross oversimplification analogous to calling our bodies just ""skin with stuff inside"". Technically true, but not very descriptive. What I'm trying to get across here is that cells are (1) bound by a membrane, that they are (2) one system of transmitters and receivers and that (3) they have a limited rate at which they can absorb/deport things. This metaphor makes it easy to visualize these attributes, so I have chosen it in the spirit of Upaya (where something may not be ultimately ""true"" in the highest sense, but it may still be an expedient practice). For a more accurate representation of cells, check out this award winning book: Cells, Gels and the Engines of Life.

[5] Throughout this article, I use Promoter as a broad phrase, to refer to Repressors and Promoters for two reasons: simplicity and to avoid the constant use of promoters/repressors throughout the article, promoter is already a long enough word.

[6] Granted most, if not all of these promoters are only characterized for E. Coli. But, with E. Coli being the workhorse of synthetic biology, this usually isn't an issue.

[7] By sustainable, I mean that the cell shouldn't die from expressing the proteins that we need for our circuit. I, however, did not mean that the output would be sustainable over extended periods of time. As time progresses, our system will break down we'll eventually get weak expression of all 3 proteins in our system. Oh well, that's life in the city.

[8] I dislike the fact that I fast forwarded past this process. The process of getting DNA ready (not to mention preparing/designing the DNA) and coercing the cells to express your DNA is a whole 'nother bucket of worms. Could easily be another article (or set of articles). (Wink wink)"
290,290,"Machine learning can be the difference between life and death. The technology, which enables computers teach themselves, is about more than who has the world's biggest AI platform -- or how well a platform evaluates cookie recipes; it could be a tremendous boon for precision medicine, which tailors healthcare to the specifics of individual patients.

Using precision medicine for cancer treatment, for example, involves identifying characteristics that could help predict a specific treatment's effectiveness for a specific patient, OncLive stated on Tuesday. Legacy methods might have based treatment on the cancer's stage, which is a relatively limited indicator of success.

""Imagine if you could take results of all of the tests ... and the results of the treatment that was done, and aggregate and anonymize all of that data, and apply machine learning to learn from that which treatments were the most effective,"" Mike Flannagan, senior vice president of SAP Analytics, said at SAP Leonardo Live in Frankfurt last month. ""Not only could you reduce the amount of the chemotherapy that was required for a patient, but you could also reduce the amount of patients who received an unnecessary dose -- or who received a type of chemotherapy that didn't work.""

Machine Learning Tames the Human Genome

""We have all the data ... more data than we'll ever be able to consume in our lifetime,"" Flannagan said. ""Where machine learning comes in is ... to turn the processing, the understanding, the deriving of meaning from that data over to machines.""

One treasure trove is the patient's genome, a massive DNA dataset within an individual's 23 chromosome pairs. Advances in IT infrastructure have enabled physicians to treat -- or change treatment -- for thousands of patients based on their genome, according to Hospitals & Health Networks on Tuesday.

""Genomic sequencing is a ... noninvasive tool that continues to provide useful information for years after it is performed,"" Louanne Hudgins, M.D., president of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, stated in H&HN. ""Because of these advances, therapy and management of these diseases are much improved -- [and] the idea that there is no treatment for genetic disorders is just not true anymore.""

Keeping an Eye on the Big Picture

""Every drug is different when it interacts with every human body, so what works well for one person may not work well for another,"" SAP's Flannagan said. ""It also has to do with what other medications they're taking -- so you can imagine trying, as a doctor or a pharmacist, to keep all of that information in your system.""

Myriad factors -- a patient's weight, age, blood pressure, preexisting conditions, etc. -- make optimized real-time prescription terribly difficult, according to Flannagan. As a result, physicians tend to prescribe what has worked for other patients in the past, as opposed to treating the individual, as precision medicine would dictate.

This underscores the importance of pharmacists in precision medicine.

""Pharmacists provide value to clinical decisions for precision medicines because they understand and can manage patients' entire drug profile,"" Murray Aitken, executive director of the QuintilesIMS Institute, stated in The Pharmaceutical Journal on Thursday. ""Pharmacists are also point-of-care references for dosing and administration, and can advise on potential side effects.""

IoT Keeping Medication Safe and Secure

""Pharmacists must be prepared for some unique challenges associated with precision medicine -- among these challenges is the safety of these medicines,"" stated Aitken, who is also co-author of this year's report Upholding the Clinical Promise of Precision Medicine. ""Therapies included in our analysis showed that 41 percent were associated with black box warnings for serious adverse events that can require specialized monitoring by trained clinicians.""

Increasingly personalized medicines intensifies the need for a completely connected and transparent global healthcare supply chain, according to Supply Chain Digital last month. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can monitor location, temperature, light exposure, humidity, barometric pressure and shock, as well as security to guard against theft and counterfeiting.

""While supply chain control and visibility is important for all industries, it's absolutely vital for the healthcare industry ... imagine if a shipment holding medicine that was personalized for the DNA of a cancer patient was spoiled or stolen,"" Supply Chain Digital stated. ""You can't pull a substitute off the warehouse shelf and ship it overnight.""

Changing Society One Patient at a Time

Machine learning has the potential to dramatically improve patient outcomes when we use technology to look for patterns that a single physician couldn't possibly see, according to SAP's Flannagan. That's because precision medicine requires examination of the entire population of data -- from all of the patients and all of the healthcare providers.

""That's the kind of learning that has the ability to really change society, and change the health of a large number of patients across a large number of health conditions,"" Flannagan said. ""But only when you're able to bring the power of machine learning to that data."""

293,293,"Drug designing tools are software and databases that are used at an early stage of modern drug discovery process. The use of computers and computational tools have permeated all aspects of drug-discovery and have formed essential part of structure-based drug design. Drug discovery and development is tremendous lengthy process involving multiple disciplines such as chemistry, biology, biophysics, structural biology and computational science. Typical drug discovery starts with target identification, lead discovery & optimization, pre-clinical in vitro and in vivostudies involving approximately 12 to 14 years and costs up to US$ 1.2 to 1.4 Bn. However, in silico screening of chemical database has now become the important tool to reduce the time, cost and chances of failure of lead at later stage of development. Computer aided drug designing or in silico drug designing has gained significant momentum in past 3 decades. There are different techniques used in in silico drug designing and including visualization, molecular dynamics simulation, homology, energy minimization tools, molecular docking etc. drug discovery tools can be used in all stages of drug development including discovery pre-clinical and clinical stage. Today all pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies take the advent of drug designing tools to cut down the time and resources required in drug development process and modern drug discovery is almost impossible without the use of computational tools. Thus market for drug designing tools is ever growing with rapid technological advancements developments.

Drug Designing Tools Market: Drivers and Restraints

Sergey Debrer | Germans: Without the atomic bomb with the Russians we can not cope

In Germany, the talk about building own nuclear weapons is gaining momentum. Last week, the world celebrated the 72nd anniversary of the American atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. German media did not pay much attention to this date - only the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper mentioned it from the leading publications. In an article entitled Zynisches Feuerspiel (""Cynical game with fire""), it was said, in particular, the following: ""On July 7, 2017, 122 UN member states agreed on a convention on the international legal ban on nuclear weapons. As soon as it is ratified by at least 50 states, the development, production, storage, transfer, acquisition, testing and use of nuclear weapons will be considered a violation of international law. <...> The threat of killing civilians with weapons of mass destruction is incompatible with the Geneva Conventions, the Hague Convention on the Laws and Customs of War on Land and Universal Human Rights. Thus, the prohibition of nuclear weapons closes a gap in international law, which for decades can not be overcome. Although biological and chemical weapons, landmines and aerial bombs are internationally ostracized, international law permits nuclear weapons to this day. Atomic powers go so far as to see a kind of security strategy in mutual nuclear deterrence. But nuclear weapons are not a guarantee of stability and peace. It's a cynical game with fire. Mankind has avoided nuclear war for the last 70 years by a lucky chance. And today it is the regions facing the nuclear-weapon States that represent the greatest instability for world peace. This is the confrontation between Russia and the United States in Eastern Europe, the sneaking of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan, the war in Syria and the escalation of the nuclear conflict between North Korea and the United States. However, political stability in the world can not be achieved by the threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction. America, Britain and France have already stated that they will not join the Convention, since they want to preserve the forces of nuclear deterrence. All nine states that possess nuclear weapons (the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel - SD ) boycotted talks on its complete ban. The United States has also called upon its allies to join the boycott. On the side of the defenders of nuclear weapons was Germany. The Federal Republic does not object to the stockpiling of 20 US nuclear warheads at Buhel's airbase and allows Air Force pilots to train in dropping nuclear charges on hostile cities. Thus, Germany is already violating its obligations under the nuclear weapons treaty. "" I repeat: the article, the fragments of which are given above, last week was published by the influential newspaper Frankfurter Allgemaine Zeitung. But in November 2016, it was her publisher Berthold Kohler in the article Das ganz und gar Undenkbare (""Absolutely unthinkable"") wrote: ""In view of the geostrategic continental shift threatening after Trump's election, Germany should also reconsider its security policy. <...> If Trump will stick to his line, then America will stop protecting Europe to the extent that Europeans have not thought about since 1945. Then the main load of worries about external security will somehow be brought to the shoulders of the Europeans themselves. This will have some unpleasant consequences that we were able to avoid when we were under the often cursed, but such convenient American defense: higher defense spending, the return of compulsory military service. And absolutely inconceivable for German minds is the question of owning nuclear deterrence forces that can compensate for doubts about American guarantees. The French and British arsenals in their current state are too weak for this. "" Koler and FAZ immediately responded to the magazine Spiegel. In the article Deutschland braucht keine Atomwaffen (""Germany does not need nuclear weapons"") it was said: ""Is it necessary to consider it necessary to equip Germany with nuclear weapons, because President Donald Trump can annul US guarantees? In no case. German nuclear weapons would be a dangerously bad example for the whole world. <...> It is right that Europeans in general and the Germans in particular, because of the disturbing events that are taking place, should rethink their own policy in the field of security and defense. But, of course, neither at the beginning nor at the end of such a rethinking Germany should not be regarded as a nuclear power. This would be a fatal signal for other countries. "" But the flywheel started by Berthold Kohler has already started to spin up. As the former commander of the Bundeswehr rapid reaction force said, the general of the reserve, and now the deputy of the Bundestag Roderich Kiesewetter - the party member of the Chancellor Angela Merkel , ""in the discussion of national security problems henceforth there should be no taboo topics."" And in March of the current year I sent a request to the Bundestag Scientific Service for the purpose of ""assessing the rigidity of Germany's international obligations regarding the handling of nuclear weapons."" As reported by the German media, the May response of the Scientific Service to Kizevetter's request contained an indication of international legal acts that prevented Germany from acquiring its own nuclear weapons. First of all, the ""Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"" of 1968 (NPT), to which the FRG joined in 1969, and secondly, the main ones, the ""Final Settlement Agreement with Germany"", better known as the "" Treaty 2 + 4 ""(concluded on September 12, 1990, the FRG and the GDR, as well as the victorious countries in the Second World War - the USSR, the USA, Great Britain and France). Paragraph 1 of its Article 3 states: ""The governments of the GDR and Germany confirm their refusal to manufacture, own and dispose of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. They say that the united Germany will also adhere to these commitments. In particular, the rights and obligations arising from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of July 1, 1968, continue to apply to the united Germany. "" Then - in September 1990, it seemed that such a refusal is enough to ensure that the united Germany has never even thought about owning its own nuclear arsenal. However, today this rejection is no longer so unambiguous. As follows from the answer of the Scientific Service of the Bundestag, ""Germany's obligations arising from the NPT and the"" 2 + 4 Treaty ""are limited to the refusal to create its own nuclear weapons. But nothing prevents the Federative Republic from legally financing British or French nuclear weapons programs in exchange for its protection by Great Britain or France. "" Given the British Brexit, the most likely partner of Germany could be the neighboring France. Moreover, the ""nuclear issue"" affecting the interests of both countries has a long history. In 1957 France tried to organize a nuclear-strategic community with the participation of Germany and Italy. His main task was to jointly manufacture nuclear explosive devices. The relevant secret cooperation agreements have already been signed by the defense ministers of the three countries mentioned above, plans have been worked out for the joint production of enriched uranium in France. But in June 1958, shortly after the election of the 18th French President Charles de Gaulle , the National Defense Council decided to exclude all provisions relating to nuclear weapons from trilateral cooperation. According to some reports, in 2007, during the negotiations of Chancellor Angela Merkel with the 23rd President of France Nicolas Sarkozy , the latter invited the FRG to take part in the French nuclear weapons program. But he received a decisive refusal - Germany at that time bluffed its image as a pacifist. But the third attempt to create a Franco-German nuclear alliance in today's conditions of demonizing Putin's Russia - namely, its German establishment calls the greatest threat to the entire Western civilization - can be fully realized. And the Germans themselves can be the initiators of the creation of such an alliance. Of course, none of the German politicians will stutter to create their own, or at least joint nuclear arsenal with the French, now, two months before the elections to the Bundestag. But all the election-related passions will settle down, a new cabinet will be formed, at the head of which Angela Merkel will rise for the fourth time (and there is no doubt about it), and then the world will find out what Frau Bundeskantslerin had in mind at the May pre-election meeting in Munich: ""The times when we could completely rely on others have passed. We Europeans must take their destiny in their own hands. ""

Russian expert suggests moving state capital beyond Urals to prevent losing control over remote regions

The capital of the Russian Federation should be moved beyond the Urals, the mountain range, that is&nbsp;further&nbsp;to the country&rsquo;s east, says Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Institute for Demography, Migration and Regional Development of Russia Yury Krupnov,&nbsp;gazeta.ru&nbsp;reports. News 19 August from UNIAN.

Window on Eurasia -- New Series: Krupnov Proposes Shifting Capital to 'Beyond the Urals' to 'De-Muscovize' Russia

Paul Goble Staunton, August 19 - In the name of development and national security, Moscow demographer Yury Krupnov has called for shifting the Russian capital from Moscow to somewhere east of the Urals as part of a much larger effort to ""de-Muscovize"" the country which he says is now at risk because of ""hyper-centralization."" Krupnov of the Moscow Institute of Demography, Migration and Regional Development has called of shifting the capital before as have others, but this time he has embedded that idea in a much more ramified system for ""de-Muscovizing"" Russia lest it fail to develop or lose control over portions of its territory (russian.rt.com/russia/news/420742-rossiya-stolica-ural-moskva). He has presented these ideas in a paper on this to Vladimir Putin. According to Krupnov, Russia is ""'hyper-centralized'"" with the Moscow region now having nearly a fifth of the country's population and the other 15 to 25 largest urban agglomerations bringing the total in such concentrations to more than half of the total number of citizens in the country. He argues that the continuing internal migration toward these centers may mean that Russia ""cold lose its geopolitical advantages and even sovereignty over territories distant from the big cities."" More than that, concentrated in such center, ""Russians will continue to lose the impulse of vital creativity."" Already, Krupnov continues, Russians don't want to increase the size of their families and are falling victim to the global plague of small families and thus withering away ... We today on one-seventh of the earth's surface live seven to ten times more densely than do the English or the Germans."" To change this vector, he says, several things are needed. First of all, the capital should be shifted ""beyond the Urals."" Then all small cities of the country should be joined together by air and water networks. And finally, Moscow must give priority to the Far East and Siberia in order to decentralize the country. Cities should be restricted in size, and the country should move from megalopolises consisting of high-rises to smaller cities based on one and two-storey housing. That will allow Russians to develop and overcome their current demographic problems, something that will ultimately require building ""thousands of new cities and the infrastructure linking them."" There is little or no possibility that Krupnov's ideas will be accepted, but one thing the current run-up to the presidential elections is doing is offering the possibility for many to offer grand plans for the future. Out of these may come some significant changes, although any move away from Moscow almost certainly won't happen under Vladimir Putin.

Window on Eurasia -- New Series: History Suggests Cheaper Ways to Get Bureaucrats Out of Capital than Moving It, Moscow Mayor Says

Paul Goble Staunton, August 20 - Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin says that the idea of moving the capital of Russia east of the Urals is just ""brilliant."" But instead of spending trillions to move officials 8,000 kilometers from 110 million Russians, those who back the idea should recall that bureaucrats have been exiled there before and at much lower cost. Sobyanin's reaction to the idea (see windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2017/08/krupnov-proposes-shifting-capital-to.html)has attracted widespread attention (ura.news/news/1052301195, republic.ru/posts/85924 and gazeta.ru/politics/news/2017/08/19/n_10456502.shtml). It has even prompted Novyye izvestiya to publish the entire document Yury Krupnov prepared for Vladimir Putin on how to ""de-Muscovize"" Russia and why doing so is essential if Russia is to keep control of the territory within its current borders (newizv.ru/news/politics/20-08-2017/spasti-moskvu-i-rossiyu-chto-predpolagaet-doktrina-razmoskvichivaniya).While Putin is unlikely to accept and act on the idea, Krupnov's words are certain to provoke discussions among many in Russia beyond the ring road who feel that Moscow has sucked up too much of Russia's resources and left too few for all the rest, thus contributing to anti-Moscow sentiments which are never far below the surface outside the current capital.

Window on Eurasia -- New Series: Russia Becomes Seventh Country in the Entire World Where It's Dangerous to Own a Bible

Paul Goble Staunton, August 19 - Christianity Today recently published an article entitled ""Six Countries in Which It is Dangerous to Own a Bible."" Now, a Rosbalt commentator says in an article entitled ""The Bible has Lost to the Vampires,"" Russia has become the seventh by an action ""without precedent in the civilized world."" The six countries the American publication named are North Korea, Uzbekistan, Somalia, Libya, Morocco, and the Maldives. In some of these, like North Korea and Uzbekistan, even possessing a Bible is against the law, and in Morocco, no one is allowed to have a Bible in Arabic translation. Russia has become the seventh in this list of dishonour, Anton Chivchalov says, as a result of a decision by a Vyborg court which held up a ban on the importation of a Bible as translated by the Jehovah's Witnesses. It held that possessing such a Bible was an act of extremism and punishable as such (rosbalt.ru/posts/2017/08/18/1639575.html). ""Nothing like this exists in any country of the civilized world,"" the Rosbalt commentator continues. The Russian government wasn't satisfied with declaring an entire religious denomination, the Jehovah's Witnesses, extremist and banning it. Instead, Moscow took the next step and banned its Bible that has been disseminated in millions of copies around the world. The court hearings, Chivchalov says, occurred in ""an atmosphere of a surrealistic theater of the absurd."" The court of a civil state got involved with assessing religious dogmas such as the Trinity and God's names. ""It turned out that the judge knew the answers to these questions,"" however strange that may seem. The experts who testified for the prosecution presented information reflecting not a deep knowledge of religion but consisting of what can only be described as ""plagiarism from Wikipedia."" The judge rejected all objections by the defense. More than that, he ignored the laws of the Russian Federation governing evidence. What the experts who testified for the government are worth is reflected by their earlier actions. They concluded in an earlier case that vampires were in no way extremist because interest in such things is ""a normal phenomenon in particular subcultures. But for the Bible even subcultures are no justification."" In Russia today, the Rosbalt commentator says, ""there is a place for the vampire subculture, but there cannot be a place for the subculture of readers of several translations of the Bible."" Consequently, one is forced to conclude that for Russians, ""the Bible has lost to the vampires."" (For additional details on the Vyborg court decision, see in particular sova-center.ru/misuse/news/persecution/2017/08/d37666/, sova-center.ru/religion/publications/2017/08/d37671/ and sobkorr.ru/news/5996E08B23959.html).

Anton Chivchalov. The Bible lost out to vampires

North Korea, Uzbekistan, Somalia, Libya, Morocco, Maldives, Russia. This is the list of countries from the article ""6 countries in which it is dangerous to own the Bible"" on the Christianity Today website. In some countries, such as North Korea and Uzbekistan, to have a Bible is prohibited in principle, in others there are various restrictions related to language, translation or use. For example, in Morocco, you can not have a Bible in Arabic. I added Russia to this list, because since yesterday it has replenished with the seventh country. The city court of Vyborg predictably punched the absurd ban of the ""New World Translation"" (ISM), which is distributed in millions of copies in dozens of languages. In Russia, to have a Russian version is now equated to extremism, and extremism is a criminal article. You can not get rid of the penalty. There is nothing like this in any country in the civilized world. Surprisingly it is that bold insolence with which we are doing such things today. To ban a major international religious movement? You are welcome. Prohibit one of the most popular in the world of biblical sites or magazines? OK, no problem. Forbid one of the most common translations of the Bible in the world? Yes, no questions asked. Scientists, religious scholars, human rights activists, international organizations have something to object there? These are their problems. It is possible to paint for a long time the atmosphere of the surreal theater of absurdity, in which the court passed. Religious dogmas were examined in the judicial body of the secular state, it turned out whether the doctrine of the Trinity was right or not, or whether God had a personal name. It turned out that the court knows the answers to these questions. Examination of the case is a plagiarism from Wikipedia, performed by people without the necessary education. The court rejected all the petitions of the defendant's lawyers, as if considering them as an empty space. These and other amusing details of the process you can read independently in a textual report of the last two days. The court ignored the laws of the Russian Federation, in particular Article 61 of the Code of Civil Procedure, according to which ""circumstances recognized by the court as generally known, do not need to prove"". The lawyers brought statements from several authoritative scientific publications confirming that the ISM is a well-known translation of the Bible, but they still had to prove this fact, because the prosecutor's office claimed that this translation is not a Bible. Of course, the evidence was rejected. For much of what the PNL was banned for, it is possible to prohibit the official Orthodox Synodal translation (SP). The court does not like that the ISM has the name of Jehovah God - it also exists in the JV. Do not like the episode with the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah - he is in the JV. Do not like the alleged errors and distortions of the text - they are in abundance are in the JV, in this blog I gave many examples. The court does not like that the ISM is a double translation from English (which is not quite so) - the JV in the Old Testament part is a double translation from the Greek Septuagint, and in the New Testament part it is a translation from the distorted source Textus Receptus. ""Experts"" are not at all afraid to demonstrate to the court their incompetence, but the court does not care. He is not interested in anything at all. The same experts (Kryukova, Batov, Kotelnikov) previously analyzed a song about blood and vampires. They came to the conclusion that there was nothing extremist about it. In their opinion, ""the fascination with horrors is a normal phenomenon in certain subcultures."" But for the Bible, even subculture is not an excuse. In our country there is a place for a subculture of vampires, but there can not be a place for the subculture of readers of some Bible translations. The Bible lost to the vampires.

Window on Eurasia -- New Series: A Baker's Double Dozen of Neglected Russian Stories - No. 96

Paul Goble

Staunton, August 19 -- The flood of news stories from a country as large, diverse and strange as the Russian Federation often appears to be is far too large for anyone to keep up with. But there needs to be a way to mark those which can't be discussed in detail but which are too indicative of broader developments to ignore.

Consequently, Windows on Eurasia each week presents a selection of these other and typically neglected stories at the end of each week. This is the 96 such compilation, and it is again a double issue with 26 from Russia and 13 from Russia's neighbors. Even then, it is far from complete, but perhaps one or more of these stories will prove of broader interest.

25. First Load of Nuclear Waste Arrives in North Russia. Ecologists are worried that Russian actions to store nuclear waste in the Far North will have serious environmental consequences, a fear exacerbated by the fact that there are more than 18,000 nuclear objects left over from the Soviet period at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean (thebarentsobserver.com/en/security/2017/08/first-load-nuclear-waste-andreeva-bay-arrives-mayak and http://bellona.ru/2017/08/14/tayni-glubin/).

And 13 more from countries in Russia's neighborhood:

""Russia now has more prostitutes than doctors, farmers and firemen combined"" and other neglected Russian stories | EUROMAIDAN PRESSEuromaidan Press |

There are now well over one million prostitutes in the Russian Federation, a figure that is higher than the combined total of doctors, farmers, and firemen, official statistics show (snob.ru/selected/entry/128051).

Anna Alexeeva | ""Going into the entrance, looking back so far."" Violence against sex workers

""Going into the entrance, looking back so far."" Violence against sex workers The court is preparing to consider the case of Vyacheslav Datsik, nicknamed the Red Tarzan: a nationalist and a former fighter without rules broke into brothels and forced prostitutes to go to the police naked. Do not be Tarzan, so as not to hold prostitutes for people: deputy Vitaly Milonov also called for them to be thrown out and handed to the police. ""Snob"" talked with sex workers and learned how they are protected from violence. ""I'll work for free - I'll let go, no - I'll cut it"" Яна, 27 years old, Kemerovo: I got into this business at the age of 22. Registered on the dating site Mamba, and I wrote one guy about the work. At first I was frightened, but the next day I decided. I grew up in a family with a modest income. Father was not long ago, one mom. In all, we had three girls working for him, all like me, without experience. Has become friends with them, till now we communicate well. We worked only on departure, in saunas and hotels. To the owner we gave 40% of earnings, and he protected us, good, there were connections with the major of one branch. He had a firm before, but there the girls-drug addicts worked, and he dismissed them. Clients rarely visited us, mostly his friends and acquaintances, including my future husband. At first he did not attract me, because he drank and smoked all sorts of rubbish. But a few months after our acquaintance, he again called me to the sauna - it turned out that he had changed his way of life. We fell in love with each other and began to meet. He was very attentive to me, cared for, knew how to do something romantic, which I so missed then. His parents were very decent people. He did not raise my hand on me even once, he did not even swear, he treated me with respect. He seemed such a reliable person! And in the intimate terms with him it was good. Two months later I moved to live with him, a month later we got married. And six months later he returned to his bad habits. It got to the point that he began to lower the last money for a packet of spices, which then cost 600 rubles. Due to constant stress, I had a miscarriage, I left my husband and returned to work in the same company. It was very difficult: I studied at the same time and could not wake up for school because of working at night. She also worked in the school, conducted a piano class, I'm a music teacher by profession. By the way, my education helps me to find a common language with almost any man. They are like children: be interested in something, pay special attention to his desires - and everything will be in order. After graduating from university, I worked as a teacher for a year at the school, I received 5300 plus 1,000 rubles extra as a young specialist. I even had a higher scholarship at the university. And ""at the firm"" came out 60 thousand a month. Soon I moved to my mother - she was diagnosed with cancer. I took off my apartment and started to work. On the second day, a man came. Looked in the peephole - like everything is fine. Opened it. He goes in, takes off his shoes. The facial expression is adequate. Goes ahead of me into the room - and unfolds already with a knife in his hand. His eyes are furious, he looks from under his brow: ""If you work out an hour for free, I'll let you go, and if not, I'll cut it."" Million prostitutes According to official data in Russia, a million prostitutes and pimps are more than doctors, farmers and firemen combined. The story of Yana from Kemerovo is typical, but only the bravest prostitutes turn to the police, and only the most horrible stories get into the media. Unemployed single mother Marina left Tver for work in Moscow. December 16, 2016 a man who introduced himself as Dima, bought it for the whole night, put him in a car and drove to the dacha, lied about the exact address. They arrived at a mansion surrounded by a high, remote fence. In the kitchen, Dmitry began to drink vodka ""to create a mood,"" he said that he fought in ""hot spots"", where he was concussed. Then suddenly he hit Marina several times in the face. She fell, he began to beat her with legs. An hour later the girl managed to crawl to the toilet and call the police. However, the address was incorrect, so Marina did not wait to help. Seeing the phone, Dmitry again beat the girl. The next day he put Marina in a taxi and told her to get out. She woke up already in the hospital - her skull was broken in several places. The personality of the sadist was established quickly: he was the father of two children, Mytishchi lawyer Dmitry Kuvaev. When Marina lay in the hospital, a priest came to her room, a friend of Kuvayev's. He began to tell the girl that she is a sinner, but she can atone for her sin by forgiveness. He asked to take the application, because Kuvaev had a family and children. As a result, Kuvayev admitted his guilt, paid the victim, who became an invalid of the second group, 1.8 million rubles. The court sentenced him to 3.5 years probation and deprived him of his status as a lawyer. Marina returned to Tver. Now she is preparing for an operation to implant a metal plate into the skull. In March 2017, the ""Silver Rose"" - an organization that protects the rights of sex workers - was addressed by Anna Stavropol, a woman working without a pimp, the so-called ""individual"". The client came to her, gave money and went to the shower, but went out dressed. Then three men broke into her apartment, said they were from the police, and they demanded that the girl stop prostituting. Dragged into the tub, got a hair clipper and offered to choose - or they would mutilate her face, or do it nalyso. The girl began to fight back. The men twisted her arms, scratched her face, eyelids, shaved her bangs and brow. Then they left, threatening to return if she did not leave town.

According to Russians, security is the main goal of foreign policy

More than half of Russians (59%) believe that the authorities should first of all ensure the peaceful and safe existence of the country in the implementation of foreign policy. The corresponding results of the survey are quoted by Levada Center. Almost every second respondent (49%) stated that the authorities need to restore the authority of Russia on the world stage. 41% of respondents chose to protect Russian manufacturers as a priority of foreign policy. Also, according to Russians, in foreign policy, the authorities should maintain friendly relations with the most developed countries (27%), resolve conflicts in ""hot spots"", and counter terrorism with other countries (21%). 19% of respondents said about the need to resist the expansion of the West and the growth of American influence, while another 14% of the survey participants believe that Russia should expand the borders of influence in the world. Previously , the results of a survey of the Pew research center, according to which almost one in every three residents of 37 countries called Russia one of the main threats to their state.

Dr Lilia Shevtsova | What is happening now is a real blow to the spine of the Russian autocracy

Can the power endure the ignore? What is unbearable for a state that has made it powerful, as an embodiment of greatness and power, a way of its survival? Hostility, envy, fear, aggressiveness of the world? Of course not. For the country's most painful - when it is ignored. Do not pay attention. Just recently, Russia was the main hero of the world conversation, as a suspect in undermining the American system. Yes, of course, it's unpleasant to get a sanction ""rebuff"". But there is always hope to find a way to get around it with the connivance of Western partners. As it was almost possible with the Siemens turbines, when Siemens was looking prudently in the other direction. In addition, such troubles can fuel a powerful pride - that's how we do them !! Turn the suspicion and fear of the surrounding world into a factor of statehood (since other signs of strength are not enough) - can also be considered a victory. But what is happening now is a real blow to the spine of the Russian autocracy. Not only did the world tackle the North Korean crisis, and Russia disappeared from the agenda. More importantly, for Moscow there was no place at the table, after which the question is solved: whether to be a war or not! And, at the borders of Russia! See for yourself. A Moscow-recognized guru and frequent guest of President Putin, Henry Kissinger, offers his recommendations on how to resolve the North Korean crisis. And he does not find a word for Russia; It just does not exist in his plan. ""The most important prerequisite for an exit,"" says old man Henry, ""is"" mutual understanding between the US and Beijing. "" Like this. Moreover, he warns Washington: there are no attempts to make China ""an American"" subcontractor ""for the realization of US interests. America and China should be equal partners. This means a new ""bipolarity"", which until recently was built on the ""axis"" - Washington-Moscow (at least in the Russian sense). So now you can forget about Moscow. It seems to be here and positive - why should Russia interfere in this total hell and the skirmish of Trump and North Korean Kim. But this is only the beginning, and soon another place will take Russia's place in the foreground. And we know which one is China. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping already phoned and chatted. And, as the press says, it was C, who inspired Trump and taught him ""responsibility."" Here's what it came down to. Not Putin teaches Trump - and Si! If the new US-Chinese tandem succeeds in neutralizing the North Korean dictator (most likely succeeds), this will be another step towards a new reality. It's not easy to talk about a new bipolarity, which already exists. Although not formally marked. The point is that the vacuum that began to form when America began to reduce its global obligations will gradually be filled with Chinese influence. How the Kremlin was happy that the era of the West and America is coming to an end. And here you are - UPPSS! - A gift. Celestial in the role of a global power that will be interested in the whole world, and not just in its backyard. This is something new. And for Russia it's not at all fun. It will be necessary to remember America more than once - and its naivety, unwillingness to aggravate, and readiness to support our state visibility. Of course, because of pragmatic calculation, so as not to bother with our self-affirmation. It is interesting how the American press, comparing Trump and Si, puts the latter as an example of his own, as a more ""weighed and predictable"" politician. And what? Against the background of Trump and other leaders, C gets points. Russia has two scenarios to cling to the proscenium, with which it is pushed out. The first is to become a responsible global player who offers real, not imaginary solutions. The second is to continue to beat the glass, trying to attract attention to itself through intimidation. The second always turned out better.

Alchemists of the NKVD fought over the recipe for the immortality of the leaders of the USSR

The special group ""Androgen"", in question, was the same as the German ""Anenerbe"", a highly classified scientific organization. And about its work and the results of research its leader, Academician SA Saveliev, reported personally to Iosif Vissarionovich. Send to OGPU Unlike the same ""Anenerbe"", the special group ""Androgen"" was created one and a half years before its German counterpart. And closely supervised by special services. In particular - first by the United State Political Administration under the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR, and then - formed by the NKVD of the USSR in 1934. It was the order of the chairman of the OGPU for SNKVYacheslav Rudolfovich Menzhinsky for the number 28 / ""C"" of February 2, 1933, that was given a start in the life of this secret organization. Formally, a certain Boris Mikhailovich Zubakin was in charge of Androgen, who independently selected and appointed suitable scientists (and, in general, any necessary specialists) in the special group's staff. As a rule, they were employees of the Main Directorate of Scientific, Scientific and Artistic and Museum Institutions - the so-called Science Sector or the General Science Department under the People's Commissariat of Education. In fact, it can be assumed with a high degree of certainty that Zubakin was an employee of the same OGPU. After all, all the scientists and specialists selected for work in the Androgyne were seconded by his orders to the special apparatus of this formidable organization. Moreover, all the personnel of the group were obliged to give the oath and, accordingly, a subscription of non-disclosure. But, at the same time, put a solid (and, apparently, quite decent) salary. Not without the participation of Zubakin was chosen and the base, which conducted their experiments, scientists - a quiet village of Kraskovo near the Moscow region Lyubertsy: and a place not crowded, and to Moscow to give. Moreover, at the disposal of ""Androgen"" at any time of the day ""under the pairs"" was a car dedicated to this case from the special OGPU. And after the actions of scientists day and night watched Eugene Sergeyevich Vlasov, ""especialist"" from the NKVD, also part of the group. But scientific researches of Androgen's employees, which initially included only a few people, were supervised by Academician S.A. Saveliev. ""Special mission number 18"" Already two weeks after Menzhinsky's order near Lyubertsy, the base was built, and, quite simply, the laboratory - in a large two-story mansion in the village of Kraskovo, where all the necessary special equipment, equipment, inventory, as well as materials, chemical elements, reagents, minerals, precious metals , Acids and other substances. By the way, the mansion itself was also on the balance of the ubiquitous OGPU and was held in the internal documents of the Office as ""Spetsdacha No. 18"". What was the main goal of the Androgen group? As already mentioned above - occult research, with the help of which it was possible to unravel the secret of obtaining a catalyst in a laboratory way, and in other words - of a philosopher's stone. And for this, scientists from the special services analyzed ancient alchemical tracts, manuscripts and old documents that could shed light on the ways and methods of achieving the tasks assigned to the scientists by the government. Moreover, the members of the special group from time to time could travel to Europe and other parts of the world for these purposes, where they studied the necessary literature on a given topic, where they hoped to find (and, apparently, found) specific formulas for obtaining the desired philosopher's stone, and also densely communicated with local Specialists in the field of alchemy and gerontology. But why such secrecy and the desire to create what they tried to do hundreds of years ago? According to the researcher of this topic, Nikolai Subbotin, the answer is simple - to ultimately obtain the elixir of youth or, as it was called, the elixir of life. This was the main and fundamental task of the special group ""Androgen"". At all times, the powerful of this world have longed for immortality. Or, at least, always wanted to live longer and strived for it, making every effort and money. The Soviet government and the party leaders were no exception. And here we need to make a small digression. For the first time, the elite of the country's councils took care of this problem, seeing firsthand how he suffered from the disease in his last years, and then died in the prime of life (only in his 54th year), the leader of the world proletariat, Comrade Lenin. It was then, in 1926 (two years after his death), from the presentation of Vladimir Ilyich's best friend - his party comrade and secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU (b) Stalin in Moscow (for the first time in the world), the Institute of Blood Transfusion was established. ""He cheated, you rascal!"" The first director of this scientific and practical institution was a comrade who was verified and devoted to the cause of the revolution, a veteran of the party from 1896 (since 1905 he was already a member of the Central Committee), Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Bogdanov. Despite the fact that it was a major ideologue of socialism, Bogdanov, among other things, was also a scientist. But most importantly - He was a doctor who believed in the rejuvenating effect of blood transfusion, for example, a mature or elderly person from a younger patient. Trusting Bogdanov with the newly established institute, Iosif Vissarionovich, apparently, was already aware of the practical experiences of his party comrade, and also knew well the effect of rejuvenation, to which his scientific and practical research leads. Therefore, most likely, having secured Bogdanov's promises about the guarantees of giving Stalin ""eternal youth"" to which Malinovsky's experiments lead (this is the real surname of the hematologist), the Boss appointed Alexander Aleksandrovich a director. Bogdanov did not just believe in his ideas, but also Repeatedly proved the effectiveness of the effect of youth, producing experiments on blood transfusion on himself. And indeed, after such ""sessions"" he felt an extraordinary burst of energy, a rise in mood and a feeling that he, to some extent, became younger for several years: his workability increased significantly for some time, wrinkles on his face were smoothed (this was noticed by many in the Including Stalin), there were other signs of the desired effect, including increased libido. Ten times Alexander Alexandrovich made blood transfusions. However, being a romantic and a science fiction writer (that is, a person of daring ideas and extraordinary solutions), Bogdanov at that time could not know (in fact, like the whole world medicine) about That there is not one blood group, but four. And not in all cases the donor's blood is suitable for the patient. And the mistake, the discrepancy of one group of another can lead to a fatal outcome, which happened during the eleventh session of the transfusion. Apparently, the donor of the doctor was a man with a completely unsuitable blood group for him, and Bogdanov passed away. Having learned about this, Comrade Stalin said: ""He deceived the scoundrel!"" Androgen brings results. Therefore, in 1933, Iosif Vissarionovich (at that time he was already sixty years old), burdened by a number of diseases, and ordered to organize work to find the elixir of life . And, judging by further events, the special group for less than two years managed to achieve encouraging results. And such that in late 1934 Academician Saveliev received from the head of the NKVD secretariat Comrade Bulanapismo, in which he instructed the scientist to prepare for the members of the Central Committee and for Stalin personally personally a corresponding report within three days. And he also hinted to the academician that on the basis of his special group in the near future an entire institute could be formed. After a short correspondence with the bickering of the scientist, Saveliev nevertheless carried out the order and made a report before the Boss. Eight pages of the text of his report on the work completed with a short summary, in which the academician summarized the performance of the task of the party and claimed that through a long chemical process the group still managed to get an elixir of youth at the exit. With the help of this final product of the debilitating work of scientists, it was possible to suspend the destructive effect on the organism of diseases, and completely cure any ailment altogether. But most importantly - the drug significantly prolonged the period of the active phase of human life. True, the report did not specify who acted as ""guinea pigs"" and who these people were. However, the final phases of the process of obtaining ""living water"" are described in sufficient detail. So, after numerous repetitions (animation) of the process, it was necessary to produce it again, but already - without adding acid. And further: ""We open the bottle, add another two hundred grams of"" Milk of the Virgin ""(apparently, this is a certain reagent - author) and digest it for three months until we see a bright red stone of solid consistency. The procedure should be repeated twice ... Thus, when combined with May dew, this philosopher's stone forms ""living water"" - the elixir of life. ""Carte blanche or oblivion? After the report of Academician Saveliev, the Central Committee of the Party decided to allocate a whole complex to the special group for work and scientific research Buildings at the station Mamontovskaya. And the actions of ""Androgen"" were already monitored by a man not from the OGPU-NKVD, but from the Central Committee of the CPSU (B) - Comrade Minenkov. Moreover, the People's Commissariat of Finance was obliged to allocate to the group for scientific research in necessary quantities the gold and silver of the highest sample and rare minerals and metals. And this document was signed personally by Stalin. What did the whole idea with the special group end? In all likelihood, nothing. Because, as we all know well from history, in 1953 Stalin was no more. Not helped by ""living water"", not all sorts of elixirs ... Most likely, Stalin, in the end, felt a dirty trick. And he did not allow anyone to deceive himself. But what happened to members of the Androgen group? Who knows who knows...

Political scientist Olga Zinovieva: The source of Russophobia is not in the West, but in Russia

Why does a Russian person take hatred towards his homeland? About this with the widow of the famous writer and philosopher Alexander Zinoviev our columnist Galina Sapozhnikova talked. How simple it would be if your ideological enemy looked like a bourgeois on an old caricature and was recognized from afar. And here - your fellow countryman with a Russian passport comes to meet you in some Riga or Prague, your hand presses - and how your mouth opens, releases such snakes and toads to your homeland that all the news issues of CNN at once seem like a kindly girlish songwriters ... Russophobia among Russians is a unique phenomenon. Almost none of the people have it. Where did it come from and why did it appear? Why do some of our former fellow citizens hate the homeland with hatred and can not forget even when they leave? And what they will get for this dislike in the end? The answer is known to the widow of the famous writer and philosopher Alexander Zinoviev - Olga Mironovna Zinovieva (president of the international society ""Russia-Germany"", head of the International Intellectual Club ""Zinoviev""). She lived with her husband in Germany for 21 years during the ""frosty"" times of the Cold War and personally watched Europe's way from hatred to love for Russia and back. HATE AT HAPPINESS - Who, in your opinion, would win today in the competition on the topic ""Who hates Russia more?"" Citizens of Europe and the United States, whose brains are washed daily by Western propaganda? Or are our people, former or current compatriots, trying to ""improve"" Russia by watering it with slops? - The roots of Russophobia should not be sought abroad. You look in Russia: Russophobia grows everywhere. Take the Tretyakov Gallery, which allows that in its halls there appear girls in dirty linen (meaning ""performance"", which was organized in May 2017 by the ex-mayor of Arkhangelsk, Alexander Donskoy, ""improving"" Malevich's ""Black Square"" girls in soiled underpants - Author). Is this not Russophobia in relation to those masters who are exhibited in the Tretyakov Gallery? This is a meanness in relation to culture and to the task that culture must bear in relation to the people and the country. How could they allow this? - I understand you very much: every year in Prague, by the forces of our liberal compatriots, an annual festival ""Kulturus"" is held, within which, for example, an exhibition of prison Russian food is held. The Czechs try the balance and rejoice. All for fun ... - They want to reduce Russia to the level of the most vulgar nesting doll. The Western world needs to reduce everything that was created for centuries by the great, outstanding, creative Russian culture and science to the primitive. We have to prove that we are people of the second, and maybe even of the third grade. ""We will sell our homeland. CHEAPLY "" ""Inside the country, we can experiment as much as we like, but here's the question: why all this garbage to take beyond it? Why shambler at Russia, running back to a safe distance, as some of our emigrants do? -Tradition to go abroad and muddy your country, alas, is not new. I watched for 21 years of life and not the same ... When the representatives of our glorious Soviet dissident emigration turned out to be abroad, for some reason, for some reason, they first began to water the country with mud. Alexander Zinoviev refused to do this from the very beginning, categorically and demonstratively. ""I think it all started much earlier."" Note how differently Russian emigrants behaved differently during the Second World War. One part began to finish off Russia, the other - desperately to help her, swallowing offense. ""Whether we like it or not, in this case we have to turn to human nature. If you do not have an inner core - ethical, moral, spiritual, a feeling that you are responsible for your words to your country and your people, if you do not care what or whom to sell ... You remember what anecdote went in the early 90's Years? ""I'm selling my homeland. Inexpensive. Such a phrase could not have been born in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s. People who are ready to betray and sell, are and have always been. A ring of disgusting, completely unbridled Russophobia is really narrowing around Russia right now. And it is necessary to struggle not with consequences, and with the reason. - And where is the line of what is permissible? I, for example, just run out of the current situation in Moscow, in which everything is inordinately overhauled. We can easily discuss this with you live in a Moscow studio. And if I start talking about this, for example, in Estonia - I will do a step toward Russophobia, or will I still remain in the field of reasonable criticism? """" I believe that you have the intelligence, intelligence and ingenuity to understand with whom and what you can talk about. Talk freely, openly, from the heart to the heart and from heart to heart, you can only either with very close people, or with those you want to convince. I will give an example. My husband Alexander Zinoviev spoke in Brussels in the Palace of Congresses. The hall was full, and we were warned that excesses are possible. He was offered - can he refuse the lecture? He said - no, I will perform. And so he goes on stage - the hall is buzzing, screaming, yelling ... Zinoviev stands and waits. Finally the hall fades, and he begins to speak in a low voice. The lecture was designed for an hour. He talked with this audience three, and almost in his arms they carried him out of the hall. That's the way to work with the crowd. CODE ACCESS- It is known that when the country collapsed in 1989, the West used special technologies. As if pressed by fingers on the weakest zones - the tendency of the Russian people to self-abasement, the recognition of a sense of endless guilt. Neither the Poles who evicted Ukrainians during the operation ""Vistula"" in one night, nor the Czechs who drove the Germans from the Sudeten, do not suffer from such complexes for actions for which the Russians have already apologized ten times, sat down and cried ... Under the influence of which our predisposition to such Self-hatred? """" I want to correct you: not ""when our country collapsed"". It did not collapse, it was destroyed, and it was destroyed not so much from outside as in the USSR. We were called to make us repent. And still call. This corresponds to the Russian character, the Russian religion. There were weak links, which were methodically beaten, knowing the specifics of the national character and the Russian mentality. ""But does this mental code not change under the influence of circumstances?"" The Russians have experienced so much in more than thirty years of post-perestroika years ... """" I've changed. "" The turning point was the Crimea, around which people gathered. On the Crimean question, the strength of the Russian character and its unpredictability came together and manifested itself. I'm not sure that if people start a new road in the Far East, the people would be so united. And the Crimea turned out to be the connecting link, the brick that holds the arch. Crimea - this is the very brick. And the arch is Russia. ""BURATINUM"" BRAINS. This ""technology"" in relation to Russia is felt even now. I've watched with my own eyes what work is being done among Russian students who study abroad. Three or four years will pass, and these young people either continue to kill their homeland from afar, or return poisoned and aimed at action ... Almost the same schemes travel from country to country, like 30 years ago, the famous theory of nonviolent revolution, Gina Sharpa .- This is a systematic work. In these ""buratinovye"" brains you can put any balls. And the fact that they are so easily manipulated is a reproach to their parents and a payment for the last 20-odd years, when everyone took so-called freedom as much as they like. But why do not these students or emigrants with experience understand that everyone Their poking against Russia as a result will be turned against them themselves? That this work will not be counted for them? - This question would make sense not to ask me, but to them. For 21 years of emigration, we did not say a single bad word about the country that drove us out. Because they understood that the homeland remains homeland. And the children were brought up in this spirit. Nobody bought us, and we did not sell to anyone. And those who sell and betray, getting their pieces for this and crawling into their holes, I do not envy. Because they will not be able to answer the questions of their grandchildren - what happened to the country once? And what exactly did you do to save her?

Anton Mardasov | India has ceased to like Russian tanks. Yes, and planes, too

According to the media, in the breakdown of technology, Russian developers are to blame. The Armed Forces of India team started the tank biathlon competition at the Army international games in Alabino, but did not reach the finals because of the breakdown of the ""outdated"" T-90 Russian design, which could be a problem for the army, the Indian edition of the Hindustan Times writes. In the competition from India, two T-90S Bhishma tanks of Russian design and Indian assembly and three crews, 21 in all, participated. In the midst of the race for reaching the final, both armored cars - the main and spare, went out of order. As a result, the Indians were removed from the competition. According to sources Hindustan Times, the cause of the breakdown of the first (spare) tank was the fan belt, the second (main) - the leakage of engine oil. As a result, China entered the finals with the Type-96B tank, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan - with ""various variations of the T-72"". The publication notes that the Indian army should carefully look at the ""not the best performance"" T-90S, which are the main battle tanks of the Indian Land Force. Allegedly and earlier their military complained that tanks can not work for a long time at high temperatures in the Indian desert of Tar (Rajasthan) - because of problems with the radiator. As a result, notes Hindustan Times, India will need to spend money on the modification of tanks.The Armed Forces of India team started the tank biathlon competition at the Army international games in Alabino, but did not reach the finals because of the breakdown of the ""outdated"" T-90 Russian design, which could be a problem for the army, the Indian edition of the Hindustan Times writes.

Allegedly and earlier their military complained that tanks can not work for a long time at high temperatures in the Indian desert of Tar (Rajasthan) - because of problems with the radiator. As a result, notes Hindustan Times, India will need to spend money on the modification of tanks. Indian media referring to military sources are not the first time criticizing Russian technology: - In 2014, the Indian Audit Office CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General) presented a report in Parliament accusing the government of continuing to license the T-90S tanks. The aforementioned reason - the delivered tanks were not equipped with air-conditioners or used equipment that was not technically suitable for the region; - In 2015, Indian journalists reported that the CAG auditors had submitted a report to the Parliament of India, which spoke of the low level of operational readiness of the Russian multifunctional Su-30MKI fighters; - In 2016, Indian oversight agencies published a report on the state of the armed forces of the country, noting in particular numerous problems with the newest Russian-produced MiG-29K and MiG-29KUB deck fighters associated with the airframe, the RD-33MK engine and the electric remote control system (EMF). Now the Indians have blamed the Russian equipment for the unsuccessful performance on tank biathlon. How justified are their claims? In addition to the Chinese in the semi-finals, all participants of the competition went on Russian-designed tanks, and no one had any insurmountable problems, and the Indians now - ""flowed"". Of course, the technology has the property of breaking down, but everything depends on the qualifications of technicians and crews, says Andrei Frolov, research officer at the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, editor-in-chief of the magazine Export of Arms. - Theoretically, we can assume that there was a production defect. But just on two samples? Which, in addition, should serve the best professionals, given the prestige of the country in international competitions and participation in the biathlon of your opponent - the PRC. The reasons for the failure of technology, in fact, can be a huge amount - a crew error, an oversight of the technicians, something is flooded and stuff. ""JV"": - If we assume that the problems are in hardware, then hypothetically they can be explained by the Indian assembly of tanks? - Armored vehicles were collected from vehicle kits, but in fact the engines are Russian. Another thing is that without any special commission, you can not check who is to blame and why the tanks actually got up. It is indiscriminate to blame Russian hardware, simply because it is Russian, to put it mildly, incorrectly. By the way, on this occasion in social networks joke, they say, you want ""aircraft and tanks""? Then ""let's sing and dance about it!"". ""JV"": - That is, publications with a clear hint that Russian tanks are being broken for various reasons, can be initiated specifically? - Yes. Something to lobby, somewhere to bargain. You see, your equipment is refused, but we buy it anyway, so make us a discount, etc. It is clear that such articles have little effect on specific business negotiations, nevertheless, they create a background for possible trade and revision already seemingly Agreements. It's no secret that there was information about the promotion of T-90MS to India and the possible signing of a contract to replace engines with thousands of Indian T-72s. In any case, Indians are very fond of criticizing their partners, and not only Russia. Then they are given bribes, then low-quality goods are supplied. And then it turns out that they were negotiating with Ukrainian companies that, through front companies in different countries, were trying to purchase Russian UTD-29 engines for later resale to India - in order to replace the old UTD-20 powerplants with Indian BMP-2. Also The Indian media themselves wrote with reference to the report of the inspection of the military department that at least 18 Su-30MKI fighters, assembled under a license at the Indian HAL corporation, installed AL-31FP engines that had already been in operation. abelnyh MiGs, in principle, a problem with them could really be. Another thing is that the Indians bought 45 cars in two batches. But if everything turned out so badly, then probably there was no need to take the second batch ... Problems with the Indian tanks in the semifinal - the fault of the technicians who service the armored cars, Vladimir Shvarev, deputy director of the Center for the Analysis of the World Arms Trade (CAMTO), is sure. ""It is clear that the implementation of sufficiently intensive Exercises during the competitions require increased attention to the state of armored vehicles. For example, Russian specialists rather quickly solved the emerging issues with T-72B3 tanks. Another thing is that the biathlon standards require a clear passage of the stages of the distance, and the real training of the crews and, accordingly, the technicians is already revealed here. India first took part in tank biathlon, and, naturally, is annoyed by this result, although the Indian crews performed quite successfully. But here it is not necessary to translate the arrows, but to evaluate the work of their specialists, who apparently did not look after the state of the main and reserve tanks in the heat of the competition, or did something wrong, that two cars got up at once. During the relay race, three crews are to be replaced in the car, and each of them must perform a whole complex of combat training tasks. As far as can be judged, the reserve tank stopped at the rise on the hill. Then the Indians switched to the main one, which had already rolled back. It seems to have joined again in the race, but then he died. By the way, Iran and Venezuela in general competed on ""master"" Russian tanks. In general, such publications of Indians can not stand any criticism. They quit the competition - look for the reason, and if there are any complaints, then you present them specifically, on the case and without the extra hype. But, apparently, the mentality plays a role, it's not a secret that in terms of procurement of arms - announcements of tenders, coordination of details of contracts - Indians are considered to be one of the most difficult negotiators in the world. They often overplay agreements that, it would seem, have been agreed upon for a long time, and as a result, the signing of the contract is stretched for years. Well, stuffing in the media in order to bargain, have already become common practice.

Window on Eurasia -- New Series: 'Occupation?' 'No, Just Visiting' - Russian Tourists Again Flocking to Baltic Countries

Paul Goble Staunton, August 20 - Perhaps the most beloved anecdote in Estonia since its recovery of independence in 1991 is about an Estonian border guard who asks a Russian his ""occupation"" to which the Russian replies that no, he is ""just visiting,"" a joke that takes on a whole new meaning now that Russians are again flocking to what in Soviet times they called ""our abroad."" Rising prices, a weakening ruble, and terrorist incidents in Western Europe and elsewhere have led ever more Russians to decide that ""the Baltics have become closer than the dacha"" and thus to take vacations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, according to Mikhail Bely, a journalist for the URA.ru news agency (ura.news/articles/1036271875). According to the journalist, the number of Russians going from St. Petersburg to Tallinn and Riga jumped 11 percent and seven percent respectively between the summer of 2015 and the summer of 2016. This year, Moscow specialists on tourism observer, the increases may be even larger. ""The Baltics always have had their segment of tourists,"" Roman Bobylev, an expert on tourism in the Russian Social Chamber for Tourism. ""For Rusisans, the Baltics always were 'the closest point of Europe,"" and to go from Moscow to Riga by air takes only an hour, less time than to reach one's dacha. ""In this sense, the Baltics are simply a mecca for Europe fans."" Russians dominate the tourist market in the three Baltic countries, he continues, because even though there are tensions between those countries and Russia, relations at the individual level are fine. Other Russian experts confirm this and also point to the fact that many Russian tourists are now buying property in the Baltic countries. Moscow political analyst Oleg Ivanov says that in addition to the absence of a language barrier - most restaurants and hotels in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have staffs who speak Russian - these three countries have become increasingly attractive destinations because they are stable, without the kind of terrorist incidents observed elsewhere. Nikolay Mezhevich, an economist at St. Petersburg State University says that no one should confuse tourism with emigration even if Russians buy property in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. According to him, Russians don't see good economic prospects for themselves as residents of the three but do see them as attractive places to spend their summers.

The court upheld the head of the military unit of NGU Matolo, accused of espionage for the ""DPR""

20.08.17 11:25 - СThe court abolished the verdict of the Major of the National Guard Romanu Matolo convicted for the transfer to Russian mercenaries of the terrorist organization ""DNR"" of information on the movement of senior officials of Ukraine, the location and movements of aviation in the front zone of the ATU. According to Tsensor.NET, referring to the ""First Instance"", it became known from the decision of the Kyiv Appeal Court dated June 29, 2017, placed in the Unified Register of Judgments. The Appeal Court considered a complaint by Roman Mathola's lawyers who requested the cancellation of the Shevchenkivsky Court's verdict on September 2, 2016. With this verdict, a native of Donetsk, a former deputy commander of the air squadron of the National Guard, Chief of Staff of the military unit No. 2269 Major Roman Matola was charged with the assistance of the terrorist organization ""DNR"" (Part 1 of Article 258-3 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).

The lawyer also noted that during the investigation, experts on secrets investigated the information that Major National Guard sent to the militants through an intermediary. They supposedly came to the conclusion that this information was not a state secret and its leakage could not harm the national security of Ukraine.

Remarks With Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, and Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera at a Press Availability

Remarks Rex W. Tillerson Secretary of State Dean Acheson Auditorium Washington, DC August 17, 2017 The United States will honor our treaty agreements with Japan without reservation, whether in times of peace or in the face of conflict. We will also cooperate to advance trilateral and multilateral security and defense cooperation with other partners in the region, notably the Republic of Korea, Australia, India, and other southeast Asian countries. We also discussed our concern about the security environment in the East China Sea and South China Sea. The United States and Japan oppose any unilateral action that seeks to undermine Japan's administration of the Senkaku Islands, and we reaffirmed that Article V of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty covers these islands. We also oppose militarization activity in the South China Sea. Maritime disputes should be settled peacefully and maintain the freedom of navigation in accordance with the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea. We maintain our unwavering commitment to the 2015 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation, and we have instructed our staff to accelerate their implementation. We also will explore new and expanded activities in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance training and exercises, research and development, capacity building, and joint or shared use of facilities. Our conversation stressed the critical role that U.S. extended deterrence plays in ensuring the security of Japan, as well as the peace and stability of the Asia Pacific region, and we plan to deepen our engagement through the extended deterrence of dialogue. Both the United States and Japan are committed to the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan, which seeks to maintain operational and deterrent capability while limiting the impact on local communities. I welcome the resumption of the plan to construct the Futenma replacement at the Camp Schwab Henosaki [1] area and adjacent waters, as this is the only solution that addresses operational, political, financial, and strategic concerns, and avoids the continued use of the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. We hope to avoid further delays that will impede our ability to provide peace and security to Japan and the region. We do express our sincere appreciation to Okinawa for hosting U.S. military personnel and for playing a central role in the U.S.-Japan alliance.

Deputy head of the ultra-right political force ""Alternative for Germany"" Alexander Gauland, who is going to stand for Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, considers it necessary to lift sanctions from Russia by recognizing the annexed Crimea as Russian territory, reports Die Welt. According to him, anti-Russian sanctions do not give a proper result, and Germany should recognize Crimea as part of the Russian Federation. Gauland believes that this way it will be possible ""to return Russia to the European order."" ""Crimea will never return to Ukraine, sanctions will not change anything. Russia is a state in Europe, and we must integrate it into the European order. We must stop its opposition to NATO,"" he said. As previously reported, the leader of German liberals Christian Lindner suggested for an indefinite period to forget about the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia, calling for starting to build relations with Moscow. In his opinion, the problem of Crimea should be ""separated"" in order to make progress in other areas. Lindner noted that sanctions against Russia shouldn't be maintained until the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, and positive steps should be encouraged by the gradual removal of restrictions.

Report of Ukraine Witness to DNC Hacking Stirs Confusion | Political News | US News

PARIS (AP) -- A report that a cooperating witness has emerged out of Ukraine to help the FBI's inquiry into the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee is drawing confusion and denials in Ukraine. A front-page story published by The New York Times says a malware author linked to the hacking of the DNC's servers had turned himself in and was cooperating with authorities, citing Ukraine's Cyberpolice. But Ukraine's Cyberpolice said Saturday the unnamed individual had no established links to hacking and that it isn't clear that the man is even a malware author. The Times' story has since been revised to eliminate the reference to a DNC link. A Ukrainian lawmaker has been quoted as saying that the Times misidentified the hacker entirely.

Appendix: The Best Machine Learning Resources. A curated list of resources for creating your machine learning curriculum.

This guide is intended to be accessible to anyone. Basic concepts in probability, statistics, programming, linear algebra, and calculus will be discussed, but it isn't necessary to have prior knowledge of them to gain value from this series.

Artificial intelligence will shape our future more powerfully than any other innovation this century. Anyone who does not understand it will soon find themselves feeling left behind, waking up in a world full of technology that feels more and more like magic.

The rate of acceleration is already astounding. After a couple of AI winters and periods of false hope over the past four decades, rapid advances in data storage and computer processing power have dramatically changed the game in recent years.

In 2015, Google trained a conversational agent (AI) that could not only convincingly interact with humans as a tech support helpdesk, but also discuss morality, express opinions, and answer general facts-based questions.

The same year, DeepMind developed an agent that surpassed human-level performance at 49 Atari games, receiving only the pixels and game score as inputs. Soon after, in 2016, DeepMind obsoleted their own this achievement by releasing a new state-of-the-art gameplay method called A3C.

Meanwhile, AlphaGo defeated one of the best human players at Go  --  an extraordinary achievement in a game dominated by humans for two decades after machines first conquered chess. Many masters could not fathom how it would be possible for a machine to grasp the full nuance and complexity of this ancient Chinese war strategy game, with its 1⁰¹⁷⁰ possible board positions (there are only 1⁰⁸⁰ atoms in the universe).

In March 2017, OpenAI created agents that invented their own language to cooperate and more effectively achieve their goal. Soon after, Facebook reportedly successfully training agents to negotiate and even lie.

Just a few days ago (as of this writing), on August 11, 2017, OpenAI reached yet another incredible milestone by defeating the world's top professionals in 1v1 matches of the online multiplayer game Dota 2.

Much of our day-to-day technology is powered by artificial intelligence. Point your camera at the menu during your next trip to Taiwan and the restaurant's selections will magically appear in English via the Google Translate app.

Today AI is used to design evidence-based treatment plans for cancer patients, instantly analyze results from medical tests to escalate to the appropriate specialist immediately, and conduct scientific research for drug discovery.

Law enforcement uses visual recognition and natural language processing to process footage from body cameras. The Mars rover Curiosity even utilizes AI to autonomously select inspection-worthy soil and rock samples with high accuracy.

In everyday life, it's increasingly commonplace to discover machines in roles traditionally occupied by humans. Really, don't be surprised if a little housekeeping delivery bot shows up instead of a human next time you call the hotel desk to send up some toothpaste.

In this series, we'll explore the core machine learning concepts behind these technologies. By the end, you should be able to describe how they work at a conceptual level and be equipped with the tools to start building similar applications yourself.

One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree  --  make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.  --  Elon Musk, Reddit AMA

Artificial intelligence is the study of agents that perceive the world around them, form plans, and make decisions to achieve their goals. Its foundations include mathematics, logic, philosophy, probability, linguistics, neuroscience, and decision theory. Many fields fall under the umbrella of AI, such as computer vision, robotics, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Its goal is to enable computers to learn on their own. A machine's learning algorithm enables it to identify patterns in observed data, build models that explain the world, and predict things without having explicit pre-programmed rules and models.

The technologies discussed above are examples of artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which can effectively perform a narrowly defined task.

Meanwhile, we're continuing to make foundational advances towards human-level artificial general intelligence (AGI), also known as strong AI. The definition of an AGI is an artificial intelligence that can successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can, including learning, planning and decision-making under uncertainty, communicating in natural language, making jokes, manipulating people, trading stocks, or... reprogramming itself.

And this last one is a big deal. Once we create an AI that can improve itself, it will unlock a cycle of recursive self-improvement that could lead to an intelligence explosion over some unknown time period, ranging from many decades to a single day.

Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion,' and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.  --  I.J. Good, 1965

You may have heard this point referred to as the singularity. The term is borrowed from the gravitational singularity that occurs at the center of a black hole, an infinitely dense one-dimensional point where the laws of physics as we understand them start to break down.

A recent report by the Future of Humanity Institute surveyed a panel of AI researchers on timelines for AGI, and found that ""researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years"" (Grace et al, 2017). We've personally spoken with a number of sane and reasonable AI practitioners who predict much longer timelines (the upper limit being ""never""), and others whose timelines are alarmingly short  --  as little as a few years.

The advent of greater-than-human-level artificial superintelligence (ASI) could be one of the best or worst things to happen to our species. It carries with it the immense challenge of specifying what AIs will want in a way that is friendly to humans.

While it's impossible to say what the future holds, one thing is certain: 2017 is a good time to start understanding how machines think. To go beyond the abstractions of armchair philosophy and intelligently shape our roadmaps and policies with respect to AI, we must engage with the details of how machines see the world  --  what they ""want"", their potential biases and failure modes, their temperamental quirks  --  just as we study psychology and neuroscience to understand how humans learn, decide, act, and feel.

Machine learning is at the core of our journey towards artificial general intelligence, and in the meantime, it will change every industry and have a massive impact on our day-to-day lives. That's why we believe it's worth understanding machine learning, at least at a conceptual level  --  and we designed this series to be the best place to start.

You don't necessarily need to read the series cover-to-cover to get value out of it. Here are three suggestions on how to approach it, depending on your interests and how much time you have:

Vishal most recently led growth at Upstart, a lending platform that utilizes machine learning to price credit, automate the borrowing process, and acquire users. He spends his time thinking about startups, applied cognitive science, moral philosophy, and the ethics of artificial intelligence.

Samer is a Master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at UCSD and co-founder of Conigo Labs. Prior to grad school, he founded TableScribe, a business intelligence tool for SMBs, and spent two years advising Fortune 100 companies at McKinsey. Samer previously studied Computer Science and Ethics, Politics, and Economics at Yale.

Most of this series was written during a 10-day trip to the United Kingdom in a frantic blur of trains, planes, cafes, pubs and wherever else we could find a dry place to sit. Our aim was to solidify our own understanding of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and how the methods therein fit together  --  and hopefully create something worth sharing in the process.

And now, without further ado, let's dive into machine learning with Part 2.1: Supervised Learning!"
297,297,"Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are all around us. And with the advent of electronic and smart devices, the sources emitting EMFs have become so plentiful that we're living in ""electro smog.""

That's a real health problem -- because the effects of this smog are breaking down the very structure of our cells, causing preventable pain, disease and death.

What is electro smog?

EMFs are basically invisible lines of force that emanate from any electrical or electronic device.

And we are immersed in a sea of them... power lines, cell phones and towers, electrical appliances, microwaves, computers, high-definition televisions, fluorescent lighting, Bluetooth devices, wifi installations and more than 2,000 satellites for GPS and TV and radio communications.

According to the internationally acclaimed Bioinitiative Report, we live in an invisible fog of EMFs.

Medical epidemiologist Samuel Milham warns, ""New research is suggesting that nearly all of the human plagues which emerged in the 20th century, including leukemia in children, female chest cancer, malignant melanomas, immune system disorders, asthma and others, can be tied in some way to our use of electricity.""

How EMF affects the body

Human cells react negatively to low level EMFs which leads to a biochemical stress response causing disease over time. In 2008 the European Parliament concluded, ""The limits on exposure to electromagnetic fields which have been set for the general public are obsolete.""

As it turns out, extremely weak electromagnetic signals, some 1,000 times smaller than previously estimated, can have serious physiological consequences.

Prolonged exposure to EMFs over two milligauss, has the following effects:

Interferes with the body's intracellular communications and cell membrane function.

Reduces hemoglobin surface area and interferes with blood's ability to carry oxygen and nutrients into our cells and take the waste products out.

Activates proto-oncogenes (which can cause cancer).

Increases permeability of the blood-brain barrier and affects intra-cerebral pressure, which can bring on Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autism, multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Causes DNA breaks and chromosome aberrations.

Increases free radical production.

Causes cell stress and premature aging.

Causes changes in brain function, including memory loss, learning impairment, headaches and fatigue.

Reduces melatonin secretion. Melatonin is responsible for sleep patterns and helps protect the body against cancer, among other things.

Causes many microorganisms living in the human body to generate increased levels of their own toxins, affecting people's health in a myriad of ways.

The negative effects are so obvious that even a simple science experiment carried out by ninth-graders, found that even plants don't grow near Wi-Fi. Check out the experiment and its results here.

4 simple solutions to reduce EMF overload

While we can't completely escape EMF exposure we can do things to decrease our daily exposure and reverse some of the cellular damage done by electro-smog overload. To get started...

Don't surround yourself with electronics. Keep your cell phones, tablets, CPU towers and laptops a distance from you. Bluetooth headsets, keyboards, mouses, and speakers also emit EMF, so thinking this will help keep you ""away"" from electro smog is a mistake. I use a laptop to work on, but attach via USB cord a mouse and external keyboard to keep further away from the EMFs. If you use a desktop, use a flat screen monitor. Go back to wired devices when at all possible.

Reduce your home EMF environment. Turn off your wifi at night -- you'll be a sleep and won't miss it. Unplug appliances when not in use. This includes everything from toaster oven to hair dryers and lamps. Keep cell phones and heating pads and Bluetooth away from your bed, and even out of the bedroom, to avoid being bombarded while you sleep. Use a battery-powered alarm clock instead. You should also swap out those fluorescent and halogen bulbs for incandescent bulbs, if possible. If not, opt for high-efficiency LED instead. Avoid cordless phones. A little inconvenience goes a long way to protect your cells!

Consume a high ORAC diet. These nutrient-dense foods contain the highest level free-radical fighters to protect and repair your cells. High ORAC food include goji berries, dark chocolate, pecans, cloves, cinnamon and oregano. For more on stopping a free-radical attack, click here.

Get grounded. A great way to neutralize the EMF radiation in your body is to become grounded. This can be done with a grounding mat or by a method called ""earthing"" (walking barefoot on the earth). When we walk barefoot, free negative electrons from the Earth are transferred back to us, reducing and canceling out harmful electric fields from out body."

MANKATO - Adopted as an infant, Sara Heller-Zimprich devotes her nights and weekends to a single-minded hunt for her birth family.

After work, she sometimes doesn't change out of her nurse's scrubs before logging on to two laptop computers to click through nine genealogy websites and family trees in search of a match that could lead to her birth family.

Her all-consuming quest is shared by thousands of adoptees in Minnesota and across the nation, but one that is frustrated by a patchwork of state laws that deny them access to their own birth and adoption records. In recent years, many states have relaxed their laws and cracked open long-sealed adoption records, but Minnesota's Legislature has stood firm and kept those records closed.

An adoption agency knows the first name of Heller-Zimprich's father, but says it can't provide it. The Minnesota Department of Health has the name of Heller-Zimprich's birth mother, but it will not hand it over.

""I just want to know where I'm from,"" said Heller-Zimprich, 53. ""It's definitely a right. You need to know where your roots are.""

A national movement led by adoptees has improved access to adoption records in 19 states since 1997. This year, thousands of people in New Jersey and Pennsylvania will see their original birth certificates for the first time. Adoptees in Missouri and Arkansas will get that chance starting next year.

Largely unchanged since 1982, Minnesota's laws place the privacy of birth parents ahead of the desire of adoptees to know their origins. Access to records by Minnesota's estimated 135,000 adoptees depends on when you were adopted. A proposal to open all of Minnesota's records never got traction in the most recent legislative session.

Opponents, including anti-abortion activists, say the law protects women who placed their children for adoption with the strict belief that their names would never be revealed.

""It scares me to set a precedent of opening people's documents without their consent,"" said state Rep. Tama Theis, R-St. Cloud, who opposes proposals that would unseal more records.

Theis has confronted the issue herself.

She placed her oldest son for adoption in 1977. The father was her high school boyfriend, and they have since married and had two other sons.

Theis said she struggles with the balance between privacy and disclosure, given that she always wanted her firstborn to be able to know his birth parents. They now have a close relationship.

With the records officially out of reach, adoptees often go to extraordinary lengths to track down their birth parents. They hire private detectives, undergo DNA tests and seek help from volunteer ""search angels"" who can piece together a family tree.

Gregory Luce, a Minneapolis lawyer, is pulling together a national network of attorneys to help adoptees know their rights. For Luce, it's personal. Born in Washington, D.C., in 1965 and adopted at a week old, he and his birth mother found each other years ago through an online voluntary registry, and he knows the identity of his birth father, who wants nothing to do with him.

Nevertheless, Luce has gone to court in D.C. to try to get his original birth certificate and adoption records.

""I want that as a final resolution of who I am,"" Luce said.

'Doesn't seem fair'

For adoptees yearning to learn about their origins, they describe the mystery of their births as a hole in their hearts and an obstacle to moving forward. They often feel humiliated when they call the state to get a copy of their birth certificate, only to find they need the permission from the same people whose names they are blocked from knowing.

They're reminded of their status every time a doctor asks whether heart disease or cancer or depression runs in the family.

""Isn't it saying the birth mother's rights are more important than the child's?"" asked Sharon Stein McNamara, a Shoreview psychologist whose clients are often adoptees, like herself. ""That just doesn't seem fair.""

When children are adopted in Minnesota, the state creates a new birth certificate with the child's adopted name. Adoptees who have requested original birth certificates from the state Department of Health are often surprised to get a call back from the private agency that handled their adoption.

That's because Minnesota law requires that agencies try to find the birth parents before honoring an adoptee's request for original birth certificates. About 5 percent of birth parents have notified the state ahead of time about their preferences. Ninety percent of them said they welcome their names being known.

Without those affidavits, however, adoptees must wait for months as the agencies seek approval or disapproval from the birth parents. Adoptees must pay for the search, which can cost hundreds of dollars. If the search is not successful, what happens next depends on the date someone was adopted. Those adopted after Aug. 1, 1977, are entitled to their original birth certificates. Those adopted before that date must persuade a judge to release the record.

Different rules apply to the more extensive records held by adoption agencies. In this case, the presumption of openness applies to people adopted on or after Aug. 1, 1982. For those adopted before that date, they must petition a juvenile court judge for access to the agency file.

Adoption agencies will often provide only vague information, such as the physical appearance and health history of birth parents, with some details about the circumstances of their birth. But adoptees who have gone to agency offices describe the heartbreak of seeing a clerk leafing through their files in front of them.

Joe Duea, 49, of Farmington recalls his frustration of visiting the Catholic Charities office in St. Cloud in 1991 and being told he needed to pay $500 for them to search for his birth parents.

It took him 11 years to decide to pay the money. Days after he did, in 2002, Catholic Charities arranged a meeting between Duea and his birth mother. He remembers a ""tiny little lady"" walking in and listening to her son talk about his life and his two children. ""I wanted to make sure she understood that I'm not mad,"" he said. But he wasn't allowed to know her name.

Then, after an awkward hug, he watched his birth mother drive away in a red Ford Escort. Duea went back into the office, and demanded copies of his adoption records.

""You've got these puppet strings you're using on me,"" Duea remembers thinking. ""That's my life right there in one document.""

They mailed him records, but struck the names.

Thirteen years passed.

In May 2015, Duea sent a saliva sample to Ancestry.com to test his DNA. Once his results were posted on the website, he devoted two to three hours each day to filling out family trees and examining what others had posted.

A year later, he came across a photo on one of the genealogy sites that showed a young man with a strong resemblance to Duea's son. His birth mother was in the picture. Within days, he was able to confirm her name. Duea mailed her a letter in December, but she has not responded. He has introduced himself to an aunt, and on July 22, traveled to a bar in Plato, Minn., for a family reunion with cousins on his birth father's side.

They welcomed him as part of the family.

Opposition stalls reform

In February, the Minnesota Coalition for Adoption Reform sent a letter to the state's main lobbying group opposing abortion, Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, asking for its support in a law that would open more records. It pointed out that Ohio Right to Life reversed its position and supported similar legislation in that state in 2013.

MCCL did not reply. Sen. Matt Little, DFL-Lakeville, said he thinks the group's opposition helped sink his proposal.

Scott Fischbach, MCCL's director, said the issue is not a simple one for the group because it supports adoption as an alternative to abortion. He said he also recognizes how few closed adoptions take place these days.

Nevertheless, ""there are women today who simply want to end a chapter in their life,"" he said. ""The idea of opening up adoptions for women who gave up babies 40 or 50 years ago is unimaginable, just like it's unimaginable to get the names of women who had abortions.""

Sentiments like that prompted Gretchen Traylor, an adoptee who opposes abortion, to quit volunteering at a crisis pregnancy center. Traylor had to get a court order to see her adoption file, which she wanted in part to know more about her health history.

""Nobody received a promise in writing of perpetual and eternal secrecy,"" said Traylor, 71, who recently moved from Brooklyn Park to New Mexico. ""You can't find a document that says that.""

Adoptees and birth parents have channeled their frustration to persuade states all over the political map to change their laws to provide more access to records. The latest wave began with Oregon and Alabama in the late 1990s. Twenty-nine states now offer at least some access to birth and adoption records to adoptees. Two states, Alaska and Kansas, have never restricted those records.

Bastard Nation, a group that advocates for opening records to ""end a hidden legacy of shame, fear and venality,"" reported that adoptee rights proposals were introduced in 13 states this year.

In 2008, a bill that would have standardized Minnesota's access to records was vetoed by then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, who cited an estimate from Lutheran Social Service that 23 percent of birth mothers wanted confidentiality.

In states that have recently opened their records, a much smaller fraction of birth parents have blocked the release of their names. In New Jersey, a state where an estimated 170,000 people were adopted since 1940, about 500 birth parents asked to block to the release of original birth certificates before the Dec. 31 deadline.

A measure passed by the New York Legislature this year was presented as opening up records. But adoptee rights groups are pressuring Gov. Andrew Cuomo to veto the bill, saying it will impose an expensive, bureaucratic system that closely resembles the law in Minnesota.

Search goes on

After nearly 30 years of searching, Heller-Zimprich had made little progress. At the start of 2016, she had only fragments of information from the adoption agency. Her mother was 17 at the time, and in high school. She gave birth in a Minneapolis hospital and placed the baby girl with Lutheran Social Service.

Still, she was no closer to her mother's name until she took a DNA test early last year. Once her results went up on online genealogy sites, she connected with a fourth cousin. Seventeen days later, she knew her birth mother's identity.

Soon afterward, a 69-year-old woman picked up the phone to hear an unfamiliar voice.

Heller-Zimprich learned that her birth mother still had her baby picture, but wasn't ready to make a closer connection. Heller-Zimprich followed up with a letter and a photo of herself. Her birth mother sent the letter back, via the adoption agency, and followed up with her own letter requesting no more contact.

""I'm sorry since this brings up painful wounds for both of us,"" her birth mother wrote. ""If there is any more communication, please let me be the one to initiate it.""

Other family members were more receptive.

In March, Heller-Zimprich flew to Virginia to spend a week with people she met online who turned out to be blood relatives. Her host was distant cousin Chelsea Tovar, a Richmond, Va., police detective and genealogy buff. ""We are her people,"" Tovar said.

Video (03:11): DNA tests and genealogy websites are giving Minnesota adoptees a chance to uncover secrets that the state would keep sealed.

Now Heller-Zimprich has focused her energy on finding her birth father. In July, she posted a comment on the Crookston Daily Times' Facebook page, on an announcement of the Ox Cart Days celebration in August.

""Looking for my birth father,"" she wrote. She gave what little information she had, that he was four years older than her mother, and a track star at a local high school, and probably didn't know he had gotten someone pregnant in May 1963. She hoped by the time she headed to Crookston, someone would emerge to help her. Until that happens, she logs on to Ancestry.com, holding her breath for a name that could finally bring her 30-year quest to an end."

300,300,"Mike Sheward was born and raised ""in the middle of nowhere"" in the United Kingdom, but he found his second home in Seattle, and in the city's tech community, seven years ago and he's never looked back.

""Growing up in a world of soccer, dairy cows and generally acceptable underage drinking and smoking, I was the strange kid interested in computers, the wireless spectrum and avionics,"" said Sheward, who is director of information security for Seattle-based Accolade as well as GeekWire's latest Geek of the Week.

Sheward got his first IT support job helping local schools in his home county of Worcestershire -- yes, home to the famous namesake sauce.

""One day, I accidentally and unintentionally busted a member of staff doing something pretty bad on a school network,"" he said. ""I found myself helping the local police force -- who were more adept at handling livestock-related crimes than digital crimes -- prepare a case against the guy. This was my first foray into the realm of digital forensics and investigation, and I was hooked. This was a particularly proud moment for me, and it foreshadowed the work I would later do with deep analytics tools, such as ExtraHop, which make that kind of work a billion times easier.""

Since then, Sheward has spent his career working in information security and forensics both in the U.K. and the U.S. He's also an aspiring author, and just a few months ago released a book of some of his favorite digital forensic adventures, called ""Digital Forensic Diaries.""

""The stories are inspired by real events from my own work, and my fictitious digital forensics investigator uses the tools that I use in real life to solve the mysteries he encounters,"" Sheward said.

Learn more about this week's Geek of the Week, Mike Sheward:

What do you do, and why do you do it? ""I'm a director on the security team at Accolade, a company seeking to improve the healthcare consumer experience through the use of technology. My time is split between writing policies and procedures, responding to Slack messages, building and maintaining our information security monitoring suite, responding to more Slack messages, reviewing code and application security practices to make sure we're doing everything safely, and checking for additional Slack messages. I do it because I love the people I work with, and the Slack messages they send me, and also because the healthcare information we work with is highly sensitive, deeply personal and we owe it to our customers to keep it safe.""

What's the single most important thing people should know about your field? ""I think a lot of people have a misconception that information security is hard to do well. It's not. All it comes down to is a lot of common sense, and taking a moment to pause and think about what you are doing. Now, that's not to say that mistakes don't sometimes occur and lead to incidents, but when they do, it's more likely to be down to a person clicking on a phishing site than the Russian government.""

Where do you find your inspiration? ""Somewhere between clicking the 'random article' button on Wikipedia (I do this for half an hour every night) and the bottom of a Northwest IPA.""

What's the one piece of technology you couldn't live without, and why? ""Facetime. Without fail I use it every weekend to connect with my family back in the UK.""

What's your workspace like, and why does it work for you? ""Bright, open, in front of a giant TV screen so I can see what is going on, and most importantly, surrounded by my friends.""

Your best tip or trick for managing everyday work and life. (Help us out, we need it.) ""Work hard, but don't take yourself too seriously. Enjoy yourself; if you do this, everything will come together in the end.""

Mac, Windows or Linux? ""Mac, which could also be considered pretty Linux tbf.""

Kirk, Picard, or Janeway? ""Picard, best voice.""

Transporter, Time Machine or Cloak of Invisibility? ""Cloak of invisibility, I'm a sneaky bugger.""

If someone gave me $1 million to launch a startup, I would ... ""purchase a cool '.io' domain name and work backwards from there.""

I once waited in line for ... ""A chance, just a chance, to turn left out of my Bothell neighborhood. It came ... after 16 minutes. I knew then it was time to move.""

Your role models: ""I can't really think of one person. I like people who are hugely successful in whatever it is they do, contribute greatly to society, and manage to still be nice human beings.""

Greatest game in history: ""Any 'Command and Conquer' game. Personal reason, growing up, my dad used to spend as much time playing them as I did. We even had LAN parties with a crossover cable!""

Best gadget ever: ""Rachio smart sprinkler controller. It lets me start my sprinklers from my phone. Sometimes I make like I'm a WWE wrestler entering the ring and use the sprinklers as part of my entrance moves when I arrive home. Other times I use it for home defense. The possibilities with that thing are endless.""

First computer: ""Amstrad CPC472.""

Current phone: ""iPhone 6S with an extended battery case.""

Favorite App: ""FlightRadar 24 (proof here.)

Favorite cause: ""It's hard to narrow it down to just one. I'm happy to live in a city with so many cancer research organizations, because I think we all agree on getting that sorted out. Fred Hutch would get a shout-out for the amazing work they do. Secondly, the Seattle Humane Society does great work in looking after dogs that might otherwise not get a chance at life. I picked up my pupper Rosie from them a few years ago. She's annoying as h*ck sometimes, but we love her to pieces.""

Most important technology of 2016: ""This might be a bit of a strange answer, but I'm going with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Obviously, this thing was an exploding disaster, but that, in a way, is why it was so important. It provides a very concise case study demonstrating that if you rush things, they can go very wrong. We deal with this in the information security realm all the time. A rush to get the latest code out leads to a bug, which leads to an incident. I've used the Note 7 case study constantly to make this point.""

Most important technology of 2018: ""Drones. 2018 must be the year of the drones. I want drones to bring me beer, I want drones to deliver my packages, I want drones to fly in defibrillators and save people and I want a personal drone to fly 20 feet in front of me constantly checking my surroundings.""

Final words of advice for your fellow geeks: ""At times when you think everyone around you knows more than you, remember they don't. They're all must making it up as they go along, and that's fine.""

301,301,"There's no denying the growth potential of the cloud computing industry. In fact, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) estimates the cloud computing market will be worth $200 billion by 2020. It is a gold mine waiting to be exploited.

That's why we're bringing Money Morning Members a tech stock to buy today that will be a primary beneficiary of this industry's massive growth.

The cloud is just a concept for a network of computers and servers working for you in another location. They store, manage, and process data, and even host that thing we call the Internet. Do you use Instagram? That runs in the cloud.

It's revolutionary because now you can outsource your computing needs and access your data and applications from anywhere and on any device. Companies no longer have to invest in vast arrays of computers and the expertise to manage them. And if they grow, the cloud grows with them.

The industry is also providing us with some of the best tech stocks to buy now...

Money Morning Director of Technology & Venture Capital Research Michael Robinson has had his eye on one cloud company that makes high-speed server switches and related networking software.

""Chemotherapy Will Become Obsolete"": A new FDA-approved medical device is revolutionizing the treatment of cancer - and it could create $7 trillion in new wealth. Read more...

Analysts did not see what Robinson saw as they cited challenges to continued growth and a patent battle with major networking rival Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO). As it turned out, Robinson was right. The company he's recommending today had a superior earnings report. And in his words, that patent dispute is a load of baloney.

Plus, this company has taken market share from Cisco because its high-speed Ethernet switches are better. On top of that, this company has invented new software for its switches known as extensible operating system (EOS), which Robinson believes are better than Cisco's.

Robinson recommended this tech stock to readers on Aug. 1, and it provided investors a nearly 20% return in one day on Aug. 3.

Robinson's favorite cloud company is Arista Networks Inc. (NYSE: ANET), which was co-founded by one of Silicon Valley's top technologists, Andy Bechtolsheim. In 1982, he also co-founded computing pioneer Sun Microsystems. Sun invented the Java programming language and was later sold to Oracle Corp. (Nasdaq: ORCL) for $7.4 billion.

Starting in 2004, he helped invent products and build a management team that has delivered 195% gains in just the past 19 months.

On Aug. 1, Robinson recommended Arista. After the bell on Aug. 3, the cloud-networking software company's quarterly results and outlook crushed Wall Street estimates, and the next day it soared nearly 20%. Volume was extremely heavy at more than six times its average daily turnover.

Not a bad call! But according to Robinson, this is just the start for the stock, as he sees it as a long-term investment. According to his research, Arista stock can double in price in two-and-a-half years.

Arista also passed all of Robinson's filters for finding the best tech stocks - before they take off."

303,303,"Awan an indictment: Remember Imran Awan, the IT staffer of U.S. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, who was arrested at Dulles airport while waiting for a flight to Pakistan? Well, he's been indicted, the Sun Sentinel's Anthony Man reports. The charges include bank fraud, conspiracy and lying on a loan application. Awan had previously been investigated by Capitol police over improper billing for computers, during which Wasserman Schultz stuck by Awan, only firing him after the airport arrest. The charges are not related to the Capitol investigation, instead stemming from an allegedly fraudulently obtained line of credit.

Bully! Vice President Mike Pence was in Panama yesterday, where the Washington Post's Philip Rucker reports Pence compared President Donald Trump to Teddy Roosevelt. And there is an obvious natural progression there. If speak softly but carry a big stick worked so well, surely speak loudly but carry an even bigger stick should be twice as great. #MAGA.

MAGA? While Pence is cheerleading for Big Don, Republican senators are not exactly in a celebratory mood, the Associated Press's Richard Lardner reports. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker said Trump lacks stability and competence. And South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott said that Trump's offering some equivalency between white supremacists in Charlottesville and those defying them ""complicates this administration's moral authority,"" which might be the understatement of the year.

I am Spartacus! The removal of Confederate monuments is not going quite fast enough for some in Durham, N.C., who toppled a statue on their own during a protest. Eight people have been arrested, though that process was briefly complicated yesterday when, per the Washington Post's Janell Ross, some 200 to 300 people lined up at the Durham County Sheriff's Office to confess to the vandalism.

Speaking of Confederate statues: Each state gets two statues in Washington D.C.'s National Statuary Hall that represent the best of their native sons and daughters. One of Florida's two statues is Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith (pictured). The Legislature already voted to replace it back in 2016, but then they couldn't agree on a replacement in this year's legislative session. So the statue will remain up until the 2018 legislative session. Who will replace the general? What happened last session that a deal couldn't get done? All in my story.

Nobody's fault but mine: After an abortive attempt last session, the Florida Legislature will once again try to repeal Florida's requirement that drivers have personal injury protection in their auto insurance. The no-fault system would be replaced with a requirement that all drivers have bodily-injury and medical payment coverage, the News Service of Florida reports.

Batting 500: The Sun Sentinel's Brian Ballou reports that this year's python hunt, put on by the South Florida Water Management District, has netted its 500th serpent, a seven-foot piece of nightmare fuel caught by Miami's Jason Leon. No big deal to Leon, who bagged a 17-footer earlier this month.

Mar-a-Lago good news/bad news: On the plus side, the Sun Sentinel's Skyler Swisher reports that the federal government has notified Palm Beach County that federal funds are now available to pay for security at Mar-a-Lago. On the other hand, Swisher notes in a separate story that the Cleveland Clinic, the American Cancer Society and American Friends of Magen David Adom, which raises money for emergency services in Israel, have all pulled out of Mar-a-Lago for their annual charity balls.

Power Lunch playlist: It's Friday, and that means another 10-song Spotify playlist dedicated to the week that was in political news. Enjoy!

MEANWHILE, IN THE TWITTERVERSE ...

Rehwinkel Vasilinda @RepMichelle

Are these the real new ""Nazi's"" ? RT: The Associated Press @AP BREAKING: Islamic State group claims responsibility for deadly Barcelona van attack in statement carried on its Aamaq news agency.

≥140 CHARACTER HOT TAKE: I dunno. These days, it feels like the old Nazis are the new Nazis.

Donald J. Trump‏ @realDonaldTrump

Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!

≥140 CHARACTER HOT TAKE: Here, Trump is referring to a story that Pershing executed Muslim insurgents with bullets dipped in pigs blood, an incident that likely never happened. It's quite a tweet that advocates for war crimes by pointing to a war crime that never occurred. Impressive stuff.

Rehwinkel Vasilinda @RepMichelle

What do #General Pershing and Bob Marley have in common? @POTUS @realDonaldTrump A: Buffalo soldiers.

≥140 CHARACTER HOT TAKE: Also, neither Marley nor Pershing ever advocated extrajudicial execution.

As always, I'm @Daniel_Sweeney. Troll me there.

304,304,"While computers are poor at creativity, they are adept at crunching through vast numbers of solutions to modern problems where there are numerous complex variables at play. Take the question of finding the best delivery plan for a distribution company -- where best to begin? How many vehicles? Which stretches of road need to be avoided at which times? If you want to get close to a sensible answer, you need to ask a computer.

Birds picture from Shutterstock

This is just one of millions of problems that are addressed by the field of metaheuristics, which is about developing algorithms that help you come up with the best possible answer in any situation where there are a large number of possible solutions.

It could be about devising job rosters that are as fair as possible. It could be about tuning the design of an engine or building to minimise energy or fuel usage. It could be about putting together the most economic flight schedule for an airport. For any discipline where a measure of quality can be provided, vast quantities of numbers have probably been crunched.

The solutions are far from perfect, however. Even for the fastest computers currently available, these problems are often challenging due to their sheer size. Exhaustively checking every possibility would typically take longer than the universe has existed.

Coming up with the perfect solutions to these kinds of problems is one of most high-profile conundrums for mathematics, known as the p=np question. While we wait for it to be solved, we have focused on developing algorithms that come up with solutions that are approximately the best instead.

Natural inspiration

Among the best known types of tools to come up with these approximate answers are called evolutionary algorithms (fully explained here). They take this name from the fact that they draw on the same narrative as Darwin's theory of evolution: that of a ""population"" of individuals competing, the fittest ""parents"" then producing ""offspring"" which form the next generation, so that the population becomes gradually ""fitter"" over time.

To see how this works in practice, take chemotherapy treatment. For every kind of cancer, the problem for oncologists is what dosage and frequency of each drug produces the best balance between eradicating the cancer and minimising the side-effects.

An evolutionary algorithm would start by randomly generating a few treatment regimes (the population). It would predict the resulting tumour size and side-effects after each treatment, then estimate the overall quality (fitness) of each regime. Pairs of regimes (parents) make a new regime (offspring) by choosing a proportion of the drug levels from each parent. This is repeated, the offspring replacing parents, until a good solution is found.

This is not about seeking to simulate biology as such. It is about taking how nature tackles problems as inspiration for how computers should solve problems. Having drawn on this since the days of Alan Turing, computer scientists have taken the ball and run with it. They have looked at how nature operates in specific situations, such as flocks of birds or ant colonies, and applied the same rules to their algorithms.

These have produced approaches to specific problems that have been remarkably effective, spanning engineering, medicine, economics, marketing, genetics, art, robotics, social sciences, physics and chemistry.

The problem

Over the past couple of decades, the research literature has filled up with endless new nature-based metaphors for algorithms. You can find algorithms based on the behaviour of cuckoos, bees, bats, cats, wolves, galaxy formation and black holes. Sometimes the metaphors even go beyond nature: musical composition, fireworks and even colonisation by imperial nations.

Much of this coincided with an old misconception that it was possible to develop one tool that can solve all these complex problems better than all the others. The way to get published in this field has been to show that your new algorithm solves a few test problems, making a case that yours could be the optimum tool that everyone has been looking for. But the reality is that while each new tool can be shown to perform well in specific cases, this Holy Grail doesn't exist.

All researchers have been doing is wasting time on developing new approaches that are probably little better than existing ones. And the language of each metaphor then invades the literature, distracting people from using the already sufficiently expressive terminology of mathematics and, above all, working together to find the best way forward.

Where next?

The backlash has begun: the Journal of Heuristics has revised its editorial policy to address this issue. Major figures in the field are calling for new approaches to be written in ""metaphor-free language"".

Yet this doesn't mean that nature-inspired algorithms are going to decline -- not while arriving at approximate solutions to our complex modern problems is still the best that we can do. Instead the focus is shifting towards improving our understanding of how existing approaches work and improving their scientific value.

One theme is about devoting more time to looking at the relationships between the variables and solution quality in a given problem. In the past we have tended to know that they are connected but haven't tried to work out how. Remedying this should help us refine the tools that have already been developed so that they can search all the possible solutions to a problem in a more intelligent way.

Another theme has been about combining algorithms with classical mathematics to help reach solutions that we can be more confident are better than what we have had in the past. We are also looking at introducing rules from software engineering known as formal design patterns, which essentially set down prescribed ways of solving a given problem to stop people constantly trying to come up with radical alternatives.

All this work represents a move in the right direction. Perhaps a retreat from all the bats and the bees will make the research area harder to communicate to the public. But it can only be good for science that good old-fashioned computer science and mathematics are making a comeback. If it means that we build better houses, develop better cancer treatments, improve our airline scheduling and so forth, it will have been worth the effort.

305,305,"(Natural News) Advancements in nanotechnology and synthetic biology could usher in new diagnostic technologies that may kill cancer cells or switch off aberrant genes. These are but a few implied uses of the recent experiments being made by researchers at Arizona State University who have demonstrated how RNA can be induced to carry out computations in a manner similar to computers. These manipulations capitalize on the relatively simple structure of RNA -- compared to the more complex DNA -- to produce a viable alternative building material in nanotechnology. The logic is incredibly clear-cut, but the more difficult aspects of ethics and morality clouds how these findings will be used in medicine.

To begin, let us first introduce this study, led by professor Alex Green of the ASU's Biodesign Institute. Green and co-authors Duo Ma and Jongmin Kim were able to create ""designer RNA"" which basically prompted (or perhaps more appropriately, programmed) the genetic cells to follow certain commands based on external stimuli. Labelled as ""RNA switches,"" cells would be combined in specific, determined ways after evaluating and responding to multiple inputs -- in the same way a computer or memory board would approach sequential operations like addition or subtraction. These logic gates followed an AND, OR, or NOT designation. For example, the AND gate would generate a certain response (typically the production of a protein) only when two RNA messages A AND B were present. Similarly, another output would be expected for the OR gate if only A OR B existed. The NOT gate would prevent either A or B from being inputted, depending on which RNA message was determined to not be needed.

This is basic programming in a nutshell. What makes nanotechnology frightening is that these processing elements are analyzed at multiple levels in mere seconds. Take note that while these three commands (AND, OR, and NOT) seem simple, the potential sequences begot from them are exponential. The fact that the circuits made using RNA parallels (and in some cases, exceeds) sophisticated computation implies a varied amount of potential uses, especially considering the limited resources of the cell.

Described more simply, researchers can now regulate specific protein production which can be applied to (theoretically) all and any RNA input. Furthermore, as these experiments are known to be considerably accurate and inexpensive, research into this field is predicted to just keep growing. This technology could be used to combat certain diseases, chiefly in areas where medical resources are limited. (Related: Programming RNA: The Future of Medicine - Carolyn Dean MD ND.)

To what end are we speeding toward? Scientists are already suggesting furthering this research into using RNA toehold technology to produce a vast neural network within living cells. These circuits would, like a computer, be able to process both excitatory and inhibitory inputs to communicate with other cells. This is, as you would remember from your basic biology classes, how the brain works, but consider that we are talking about replicating the same process at a genetic level -- a series of computations and iterations that scientists (or maybe eventually the government) could control at their whim.

""Because we're using RNA, a universal molecule of life, we know these interactions can also work in other cells, so our method provides a general strategy that could be ported to other organisms,"" concludes Green who foresees a future in which human cells could become fully programmable entities.

It is indeed a brave new world we are seeing, but are we witnessing the horizon of progress or an image of our own impending doom?"
306,306,"Consulting engineer and RW family member confronts his diagnosis and reflects on career

Today I'm tipping my hat to a friend and colleague in the Radio World family, Tom Osenkowsky, in recognition of an accomplished career.

You may know him from his technical consulting work, articles in Radio World, a chapter in an SBE handbook about disaster planning, presentations to the NAB Broadcast Engineering Conference, or SBE and IEEE Broadcast Technology Society events.

One good reason to make note of Tom's career right now is that the 11th edition of the National Association of Broadcasters Engineering Handbook is fresh in print. This is a particularly important industry reference, and Tom has had a hand in the two most recent editions as associate editor and a chapter co-author.

The other reason is that he is terminally ill. Tom has been actively battling lymphoma, multiple myeloma and stage IV renal failure since December of 2014. In July of this year, due to the lack of available options and low blood counts, he terminated his cancer treatments. As I write, he is in the care of Regional Hospice & Palliative Care in Danbury, Conn.

""I was proud to be the first patient in New England to beta test a new chemo, Darzalex, which lowered my Creat[inine] to where I did not require dialysis,"" he told me.

""Unfortunately it did not lower other critical anomalies in my blood. Other patients are benefiting from the data gathered during my stay in the Observation Floor at Danbury Hospital.""

Tom has been an absolute inspiration to me in the direct and honest way he has confronted this prognosis. He stated his outlook frankly: ""I do not have any dependents, and cared for my parents up to their final breaths. It is time to go.""

A RANGE OF RF WORK

I asked him to reflect on memories of his broadcasting career; replying by email, he was typically matter of fact. He said it began by accident during high school.

""I started as a news stringer for local station WINE, Brookfield, Conn.,"" he said. ""After attending Central Connecticut State College for a year, I got married and worked for Automation Industries Inc. in Danbury, Conn. I learned a lot of the manufacturing process.""

The opportunity arose to become chief engineer of then-WOWW(AM) in Naugatuck; he worked there until he was hired -- despite a lack of FM experience -- by the late Bill Patrick at WAVZ(AM)/WKCI(FM) in New Haven.

""A little over a year later our Alford directional FM antenna was destroyed by falling ice, and I negotiated a mutual consent agreement with a neighboring adjacent-channel station which allowed us to operate non-directionally,"" Tom remembers. ""I designed a two-bay antenna at increased height on the WTNH(TV) tower, which allowed a very substantial increase in coverage.""

He also served WRCQ/WRCH as chief engineer. He did contract engineering on a long-term basis for WNHU, WQAQ, WVOF and WNTY. He performed engineering in St. Maarten and Aruba, as well as across the United States for AM/FM clients. Tom wrote computer programs to assist in the design and analysis of AM antenna and coupling systems to allow broadband operation with increased fidelity and coverage.

""One of the more interesting projects was to design an AM/FM reception system using multiple tuners for a client who monitored and recorded broadcast stations for the purpose of reconstructing their program and music logs,"" he said.

""In this case reception was as important to their business model as transmission was to a broadcast station. I specified the required antennas, equipment and installation procedures and was able to meet their needs. The sole exception was a directional AM whose array placed a null directly over their offices. Direct reception was not possible in that case and an alternative reception method was required.""

Another interesting and precedent-setting project was convincing the FCC to recognize the effect of a tower on a non-directional FM antenna.

""My client relocated their FM to a NCE TV tower, and a co-channel neighbor objected. I did range tests and we agreed to specifically mount our antenna in such a manner as to minimize signal toward their market and remain classified as a non-directional station. The station has since vacated the site and the objecting station was sold.""

""GENUINE COMPASSION""

An article like this can struggle to capture the personality behind the deeds. I asked colleagues to share their own thoughts.

Paul Shulins said Tom has made countless contributions. ""Never afraid to speak his mind when he feels that broadcasters can benefit from his comments, he has on numerous occasions either made us rethink issues, or has brought us a different perspective that was never previously considered."" He called Tom not only an excellent engineer but a wonderful role model and human being.

NAB's David Layer worked with him on the handbook. ""He was truly the perfect man for the job, he had the right engineering knowledge and the right contacts and acquaintances in the broadcast engineering community to help find and recruit the right authors for our chapters, to work with the authors on developing the content, and to massage that content into the outstanding material that has become the hallmark of the NAB Engineering Handbook publication."" As Layer put it, no one gets wealthy from this work, it is more a labor of love

I learned that Tom is well respected in the consulting community.

Ron Rackley, who has known him for more than three decades, told me, ""Tom has an honest intellectual curiosity to go along with his rather intense personality that has always driven him to excellence.""

They met when Ron was curriculum coordinator and a lecturer for the old AM Directional Antenna Seminar at NAB headquarters in Washington in the 1980s. ""He and I sat at lunch one day and discussed how some AM directional antenna patterns can be reverse-engineered into their component pairs so that alternative designs for the same pattern shape can be evaluated for optimal performance,"" Ron recalled.

""I explained how it would require solving a complex system of simultaneous polynomial equations, something I had never attempted mathematically, favoring solution by simpler iterative analysis myself. A few weeks later, a floppy disk arrived with a program to reverse-engineer patterns using the math I had described. Tom had taught himself the math and written his 'moding' software for rapid solutions with it."" Ron was impressed.

Perhaps the person who best described Tom's personality, as I've experienced it, is Gary Cavell. He only got to know Tom while working on the handbook. ""But somehow, jumping into this project with him was like continuing a long conversation with someone I had known for years."" Tom, he said, undertook the editing and management of more chapters than anyone, ""and did so with resolute dignity while quietly coping with the greatest challenge of his life.""

He took note of Tom's ""personality, intelligence, humor, sense of justice and firm convictions,"" and added, ""He does not suffer fools easily, and will not shy away from a confrontation if someone is being treated unfairly in his presence.""

He captured something that I, too, noticed. ""I suppose he can be intimidating to some, due in part to a seemingly prickly 'New York' personality, but there is a serious undercurrent of warmth and genuine compassion that unfailingly comes through. I especially enjoy his sharp, often 'off the wall' humor that he seamlessly interjects into situations, typically when sorely needed.""

I echo this. Maybe as a born New Yorker, I'm well suited to finding Tom's deadpan, puckish sense of humor so appealing.

SMOKIN' TOM GARY

So what does this engineering veteran feel is the most notable recent development in radio broadcast engineering? Tom points to the integration of computers, audio over IP, automation and syndication in studio and transmitter facilities.

""This is somewhat due to the newly introduced methods of delivering entertainment, news, sports, weather and information to the public,"" he said. ""Smartphones, iPhones and similar devices have replaced portable transistor radios. They are also interactive with the owner.""

Over-the-air broadcasters have attempted to reduce operating expenses by eliminating local talent, he said. Stations have consolidated and some have surrendered their licenses. ""The face of broadcasting has changed and so have the audience and their expectations. The advertising dollar has been divided in many ways, leaving OTA broadcasters with a lesser share than previous times.""

Meanwhile, on the personal level, his closest friend has been trying to help out as best he can. Russ Mundschenk met Tom Osenkowsky on CB radio in 1969; he considers Tom not only his lifelong buddy but his mentor, even though they are the same age.

""We have followed each other through the same studios and transmitter sites for the past 48 years. I stood up for him when he married Peggy and am still there for him today.

""We started out as WLAD announcers filling the shifts no one else wanted. 'Smokin' Tom Gary' went on to more lucrative pursuits as chief engineer of that Danbury, Conn., station and WKCI/WAVZ in New Haven. There, he made both stations the loudest on the dial by cobbling together one of the first multi-band audio processors with a Crown crossover, dbx AGC's and an Optimod 8000.""

Tom, Russ recalled, was also responsible for rebuilding many AM arrays in the Northeast including daytimer WNTY in Southington, Conn., and developed a simple DOS-based method-of-moments software suite that others have found very useful.

This July, after lunch and a flight in Paul Shulin's Piper Warrior, Tom gave Russ the same Radio Shack DX-150 that Russ used to learn Morse Code in 1969.

Thank you, Tom -- for your contributions to radio, for your work in Radio World, for your friendship these many years, and for your fortitude and inspiration. It shouldn't require an illness to tell you that we're proud to know you."

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is recovering from emergency surgery after taking a fall on Sunday. It was the first day of his vacation.

Giuliani, 73, and his wife, Judith, were hosting friends at their home on Long Island when Giuliani's knee buckled, unable to support his weight.

Giuliani told Page Six, ""I was a catcher from a very young age, and I have suffered with 'catcher's knee' for years."" Baseball catchers have notoriously weakened knees due to the dozens of deep knee bends required of them each game.

""[T]he doctors said it would deteriorate,"" said Giuliani after his quadriceps tendon surgery.

Fortunately for Giuliani, Judith, a trained nurse, witnessed the fall and her experience told her that the unnatural buckle in her husband's knee was a sign that he needed medical attention.

""I tried to get up but Judith ordered me not to move. If it hadn't been for her, the injury would have been a lot worse. I now call her 'Nurse Nancy.' I swear to God, it was my first day of vacation and we'd planned to play a lot of golf. I don't think I will be playing golf for a few weeks,"" Giuliani told Page Six.

Judith concurred, saying ""It is a good thing that I am a trained nurse.""

Judith made a jest at her husband's strong-willed character.

""Our guests wanted to pick him up -- he's a tough guy and he wanted to get up -- and I said he should not move. It was an instant red flag. When I looked at the limb, I knew if he got up, it would just do more damage. Rudy had to have surgery right away.""

According to Judith, Giuliani will be hospital for a few more days and may have to rely on crutches for a while, ""but he's in great spirits. He is the eternal optimist.""

Giuliani told Page Six, ""I am already up and limping around. I'm a tough guy, so this isn't going to stop me.""

His wife confirmed that Giuliani is already back doing what he loves, ""Of course, he's already working from his hospital bed, he's got the computers going, two phones, a couple of iPads and a Kindle. He's not by any means down for the count.""

Giuliani is best known for his leadership through the trying days of the September 11 attacks, for which he was named Time Magazine Person of the Year in 2001. Before his time as NYC Mayor, he was a 'crime-busting' prosecutor successfully battling the Mafia. In his teenage years, Giuliani also wielded significant influence, using his charisma to convince boys who had no real interest in opera to join his opera club."
308,308,"People suffering from chronic pain can now get medical marijuana in New Hampshire, thanks to a law extending the treatment to cover new conditions that takes effect this week. Later in the month, people with post-traumatic stress disorder will also qualify.

Chronic pain is the most common reason why people seek out medical marijuana, according to a National Academies of Sciences report earlier this year. Add PTSD, and New Hampshire's medical marijuana market is looking at some major changes.

Two marijuana entrepreneurs talked with NHPR's Rick Ganley about how their businesses will change.

Anthony Parrinello, executive director of Temescal Wellness, which operates two of the four dispensaries authorized to provide medical marijuana in the state, said he's preparing for a rush of new patients. ""Whether the program is going to double in qualifying patients or triple, that remains to be seen, but we certainly are expecting a large influx of patients.""

Brett Sicklick, chief operating officer for Prime Alternative Treatment Center of New Hampshire, which runs a dispensary in Merrimack, shares that anticipation. ""We don't expect it to happen overnight, but it will ramp up pretty quickly,"" he says.

The two providers offer marijuana in various forms to patients with cancer, glaucoma, spinal cord injuries, and other conditions. The companies formed after medical marijuana was made legal in the state in 2013.

Today, Parrinello and Sicklick agree that a remaining hurdle for their industry is education. ""Because,"" Sicklick says, ""for most of our patients, this is something entirely new to them. They had never encountered cannabis during their entire life, so there's a pretty significant learning curve.

""We have a multitude of different delivery methods that are available that all require explanations, how they are meant to be utilized. And certainly talking about dosage is very important, because everybody has a different required dosage.""

Parrinello says the need for education extends to doctors, as well. ""One of the challenges is the number of physicians or advanced nurse practitioners that are willing to recommend therapeutic cannabis as a safe alternative. I was speaking with a nurse practitioner last week in Bedford, and right now, before pain and PTSD come online as qualifying conditions, she's booking out through the end of November. And if you were to go in to see a specialist, that's an awful long lead time to get an appointment.

""So I see lead times of current recommending providers to grow, and unfortunately, I wish, we all wish, that many providers would perhaps take a closer look at therapeutic cannabis as an alternative, and do some research, and be willing to write a recommendation.""

One place the message about marijuana does seem to be getting through is local police department. ""When I spoke to the former chief of police maybe four months ago,"" Sicklick says, ""I asked, how are we doing? Are we getting in the way, are we a problem? And he said, I don't even know that you guys are there. You don't present any challenges, you don't pose any threats on the community, and you operate like any other business does.""

Parrinello echoes that positive experience, and says he and his business ""have ongoing relationships with law enforcement to keep them apprised of new products that we're bringing to market, so they have an understanding of what products are coming from our facilities versus the street. I think the law enforcement officials are very appreciative of that.""

Sicklick and Parrinello both say a bigger challenge they face has to do with the way the medical marijuana law is written. The law has regulations meant to keep the drugs from falling into the wrong hands, requiring prospective patients to go through a screening process.

Parinello says those regulations can slow down the process of getting a prescription and getting it filled. ""One thing that's a little bit cumbersome for patients is having to burn a photo onto a CD and mail that in with their application. Many computers don't come with CD [burners], obviously.""

Other regulations cover caregivers, people authorized to purchase medical marijuana on behalf of someone unable to travel to a dispensary. But Sicklick says getting that authorization, too, is a bureaucratic trial.

""That process now includes a criminal background check and fingerprinting, and it's just above and beyond what's required for someone to handle that responsibility. We don't see that with opiates, which are obviously far more dangerous and far more of a problem, so if we're not requiring it for a drug like that, I don't think it should be that way for cannabis.""

New Hampshire's new law, establishing chronic pain as a qualifying condition for medical cannabis, goes into effect on Tuesday this week, and PTSD will be added to the list on August 27th."
309,309,"Tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are engaged in a very public disagreement about the nature of artificial intelligence (machines that can think) and whether it's a boon or bane to society. It's almost as interesting to follow as the Hollywood supercouple-of-the-month's divorce proceedings.

Just kidding. Let's agree that the former is relevant, the latter ridiculous.

Musk has been warning for some time now that AI is ""our greatest existential threat"" and that we should fear perpetuating a world where machines are smarter than humans.

It's not that he's against AI: Musk has invested in several AI companies ""to keep an eye on them."" He's even launched his own AI start-up, Neuralink--intended to connect the human brain with computers to someday do mind blowing things like repair cancer lesions and brain injuries (for example).

Musk fears the loss of human control if AI is not very carefully monitored.

Zuckerberg sees things very differently and is apparently frustrated by the fear-mongering. The Facebook chief has made AI a strategic priority for his company. He talks about the advances AI could make in healthcare and self-driving cars, for example.

In a recent Facebook Live session where he was answering a question about Musk's continued warning on AI, the Facebook founder responded, ""I think that people who are naysayers and kind of trying to drum up these doomsday scenarios--I just, I don't understand it. I think it's really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.""

The debate is sure to continue to volley back and forth in a sort of Wimbledon of the Way Out There.

So, at the risk or Mr. Musk calling me out, I thought I'd try to bring it a bit closer to home so you can track better with the debate and form your own opinion. Here are some of the most commonly cited pros and cons to AI:

So are you more of a Muskie or a Zuckerberger?

Better decide which side you lean towards. Before the machines decide for you."
310,310,"India's achievements in space, marked by missions to the moon and Mars; its nuclear power programme; and the range of missiles in its armoury were made possible by the visionary zeal of scientists such as Vikram Sarabhai and Homi J. Bhabha and the commitment of the political leadership to building a scientific temper. By T.S. SUBRAMANIAN

IF India is one of the top players in the world in space, nuclear power and missiles despite embargoes and technology-denial regimes heaped on it, a large share of the credit should go to the founding fathers of these programmes, Vikram Sarabhai, Homi J. Bhabha and Air Vice Marshal V.S. Narayanan respectively. Those who came after them built on this foundation to make the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) institutions that earned the respect of the world.

Success upon success has visited ISRO in the past several years. It successfully put into orbit its spacecraft around Mars in its first attempt on September 24, 2014. The spacecraft completed 1,000 earth days in its orbit on June 19, 2017, well beyond its designated mission life of six months. Its mission to the moon, Chandrayaan-1, was the first to discover the presence of water molecules on the lunar surface soil and rocks.

On June 5, 2017, ISRO's first developmental flight of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-MkIII D1), its heaviest vehicle yet at 640-tonne, successfully put a satellite, GSAT-19, weighing 3,136 kg into orbit, the heaviest to be put into orbit from India. Each of the launch vehicle's three stages, including its indigenous cryogenic stage, is the heaviest ISRO has built so far.

This came on top of the four straight successful launches of the GSLV-MkII with an indigenous cryogenic engine and 39 successful flights in a row of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) since 1994, with the 38th launch, on February 15, putting a world record number of 104 satellites into orbit. In fact, the PSLVs have put into orbit 209 satellites from abroad, earning big money for Antrix, the commercial wing of the Department of Space.

Today ISRO has the capability to build any type of launch vehicle and any type of satellite that it can launch into any type of orbit. ""We have achieved real self-reliance in all areas of launch vehicle technology,"" says K. Sivan, Director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thiruvananthapuram.

As for satellites, the ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC) in Bengaluru has built a whole range of satellites, for communication, remote-sensing, prediction of weather, navigation, cartography, surveillance, ocean studies and education, besides science satellites Chandrayaan-1, Mars Orbiter and Astrosat. Also on its list is an orbiter to Venus, which will have a balloon experiment to study Venus' atmosphere. Beginning with Aryabhata in 1975, ISAC has so far rolled out 96 satellites.

ISRO's sights are now set on the totally indigenous Chandrayaan-2 mission, which will involve getting a lander carrying a rover to softland on the lunar surface. The orbiter, the lander and the rover will together weigh 3,250 kg. M. Annadurai, Director, ISAC, said ISRO was aiming for a launch in the first quarter of 2018.

Aryabhata and the two earth observation satellites that followed, Bhaskara-1 and Bhaskara-2 were launched by Russian rockets, and they were followed by APPLE (Ariane Passenger Payload Experiment), India's first experimental communication satellite, launched by the Ariane rocket of the European Space Agency (ESA) from French Guiana. After Professor U.R. Rao became its Chairman in 1984, ISRO came into its own, building full-fledged remote-sensing satellites that are used in agriculture, fishing, and mapping of urban and rural areas.

Using information provided by India's satellites in low-earth and geostationary orbits, information about the weather over the Indian subcontinent is provided to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) every 15 minutes now. This information is augmented by images coming from Oceansat-2 and SCATSAT-1. In fact, data from SCATSAT-1, which was put into orbit by PSLV-C35 on September 26, 2016, was used to monitor the flood situation in Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal in July 2017.

ISRO also has in orbit a constellation of seven navigation satellites, which, according to Annadurai, ""are among the fastest realised systems [in the world]"".

A key focus area of ISRO is building reusable launch vehicles (RLVs). In fact, the RLV programme crossed a milestone on May 23, 2016, with the launch and return of a winged RLV-TD in a scaled configuration that flew at a hypersonic speed. On August 28, 2016, ISRO took the next steps towards reducing the cost of access to space when a modified two-stage vehicle developed by the VSSC used air-breathing propulsion in its scramjet engine.

In five decades, ISRO's has been a remarkable journey in space, which began in the 1960s with the launch of a 'pencil-rocket' that reached a height of a few kilometres with a couple of kilograms of propellants.

Nuclear power

The need for total self-sufficiency is what guides India's three-stage nuclear power programme too. The DAE has achieved this while building Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), which forms the first stage, and is all set to usher in the second stage when the 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) at Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu, goes critical in December 2017. The PFBR, says Kallol Roy, CMD of Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited (BHAVINI), is meant to be a techno-economic demonstration of large fast reactors to be built in series. It will be a big jump from the 13 MWe Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) at Kalpakkam. BHAVINI, the DAE's public sector undertaking responsible for building breeder reactors, plans to build four more breeder reactors, including two at Kalpakkam. Once the PFBR becomes operational and delivers 500 MWe power to the grid, says Kallol Roy, it will ""serve as a stepping stone towards long-term energy security for the country"".

Questions have been asked about why India is pressing ahead with breeders when advanced countries have given them a wide berth. But the French nuclear scientist George Vendryes has gone on record that India is on ""the right path"" and that he ""admired India"" for what it is doing (Frontline, August 25, 2006).

While the PHWRs use natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as both coolant and moderator, the fast breeder reactors use plutonium-uranium mixed oxide as fuel. In the third stage, reactors using thorium as fuel will be built. The three stages are interlinked.

Today, India has 22 reactors with an installed capacity of 6,780 MWe. Of these, 18 are PHWRs. Four, two each at Tarapur and Kudankulam, are Pressurised Water Reactors (PWRs) that use enriched uranium as fuel and light water as coolant. The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), DAE's flagship PSU, is building four indigenous 700 MWe PHWRs -- two each at Rawatbhatta in Rajasthan and Kakrapar in Gujarat -- and they are in an advanced stage of construction.

On May 17, 2017, the Union Cabinet approved the construction of 10 more 700 MWe PHWRs. They are to come up at Gorakhpur in Haryana, Chutka in Madhya Pradesh, Kaiga in Karnataka, and Mahi Banswara in Rajasthan. ""If the NPCIL was earlier building reactors in pairs, it will build the 10 new units in a fleet mode as a fully home-grown initiative,"" says N. Nagaich, Director (HR), NPCIL. The 10 reactors are expected to generate manufacturing orders worth Rs.70,000 crore to Indian industry that can generate around 34,000 jobs in direct and indirect employment.

The two Russian PWR reactors of 1000 MWe each at Kudankulam are already generating electricity and construction work has begun on two more such reactors on June 29.

Having mastered the PHWR technology and all set to herald the breeder reactors' era, the DAE has set its sights on building 900 MWe PWRs, which will use enriched uranium as fuel. The DAE gained enormous experience in this area when it developed the 80MWt PWR which powers India's nuclear-powered submarine Arihant.

The 63-year old DAE is an empire that has 64 organisations under its belt, including PSUs, research centres, academic institutions and industrial organisations that are involved in the entire gamut of activities relating to nuclear electricity generation.

The nerve-centre of the DAE is the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) at Trombay, Mumbai. It is perhaps the largest R & D facility in the world where the widest spectrum of activities in nuclear science and technology and many other areas are carried out. It has done remarkable work in radiation medicine, nuclear agriculture, irradiation of mangoes, potatoes, onions, tomatoes and spices to prevent their decay and sprouting, radio astronomy, lasers, accelerators, fusion, cryogenics, plasma and so on. Its scientists specialise in supercomputers, robotics, artificial intelligence, superconductivity and virtual reality.

K.N. Vyas, Director, BARC, calls it ""a technology powerhouse"" that has blended multi-disciplinary skills in basic sciences and engineering disciplines to address the technological challenges of atomic energy. Dhruva, a high-flux reactor at BARC, Trombay; notable capability in synthetic organic chemistry; and expertise in radiochemical processing have been instrumental in developing novel radiopharmaceuticals. After undergoing quality checks and trials in collaboration with Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, they have been released for cancer treatment, says Vyas. Radiopharmaceuticals have also been produced by a medical cyclotron available with BARC.

BARC's contribution to cancer treatment includes the Bhabhatron, a cobalt teletherapy machine, whose capability has been enhanced to ensure that the radiation dose is delivered precisely to the tumour. It has also developed tiny iodine125-based brachytherapy sources, encased in thin titanium shells, for treating eye cancers.

Vyas says BARC has developed a sewage sludge hygienisation technology, wherein high energy gamma radiation from cobalt 60 source inactivates pathogens, kills weeds, degrades chemical contaminants and enables inoculation with useful bio-nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium bacteria, converting the waste sludge into manure. A dry sludge hygienisation plant, with a capacity of 100 tonnes a day, is being built for Ahmedabad municipal corporation.

Through genetic enhancement, BARC has developed and released, in collaboration with agriculture universities, more than 40 different crop varieties, among them groundnut, urad bean, channa, moong, black gram, pigeon pea, rice, mustard, jute and soya bean, that are high-yielding varieties and resistant to diseases and drought. A semi-dwarf aromatic mutant of Dubraj rice called Trombay Chattisgarh Dubraj Mutant-1, with an improved yield of 35 per cent and 15 days less of maturity period, will soon be released in collaboration with the Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya, Raipur.

BARC has also developed a supercomputer called Anupam Agnaya with a capacity of 270 terraflops, spectroscopes for ISRO's missions to the Moon (Chandrayaan-1) and Mars, and lightweight bullet-proof jackets for armed forces' personnel.

DRDO

In the field of defence research India has a massive empire in the form of the DRDO whose range of activities is staggering. Set up with 10 laboratories on January 1, 1958, it now boasts more than 52 big laboratories situated in different parts of the country. These laboratories can be categorised into seven clusters: aeronautics, missiles and strategic systems, electronics, computational systems, armaments and naval systems, strategic systems, and materials and life sciences. They develop everything that the armed forces need: missiles, main battle tanks, combat aircraft, infantry combat vehicles, bridge-laying tanks, underwater vehicles, radars, sonars, smart materials, stealth technologies, high explosives, torpedoes, parachutes, aerostats, lasers, nano-tubes, robots, desalination plants, assault rifles and so on.

Other products they have developed include foldable stretchers, self-heating socks and gloves for soldiers posted in the rarefied heights of Siachen, underground shelters for use in nuclear, biological and chemical warfare, ready-to-eat chapatis, nutritional bars, protein-rich food and so on.

However, it is the portfolio of missiles DRDO has developed at its missile complex in Hyderabad that makes India proud. The complex has three facilities: Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL), the Advanced Systems Laboratory (ASL), and the Research Centre, Imarat (RCI). In the portfolio are surface-to-surface missiles, surface-to-air missiles (SAM), air-to-ground, air-to-air, anti-tank, underwater-launched and supersonic cruise missiles.

In the future, says G. Satheesh Reddy, Director-General (Missiles and Strategic Systems), DRDO, the thrust will be on high-energy propellants, high temperature materials and coatings, sensors and detectors, radomes and material technologies, and highly miniaturised, low-cost and accurate integrated avionics. DRDO will be looking to ""establish focussed research centres in specific technologies in R and D centres and academic institutions"" to achieve these objectives.

Among the missiles in India's arsenal, the interceptors form the building blocks of its ballistic missile defence (BMD) shield. They can intercept an enemy missile in the exo-atmosphere (above an altitude of 80 km) or the endo-atmosphere (at an altitude of 15 km to 35 km) and pulverise them either in a ""hit-to-kill"", which is a head-on collision, or in a ""proximity kill"". The interceptor missions launched from Abdul Kalam Island (formerly Wheeler Island) off the Odisha coast have been spectacular successes, with most of them scoring direct hits on incoming ""enemy"" missiles simulating the trajectory of ballistic missiles with a range of about 2,000 km.

The exo-atmospheric interceptor is a completely indigenously developed missile with critical technologies such as infra-red seeker, and control and guidance and propulsion systems developed in-house and supported by Indian industry through an ecosystem that DRDO nurtured. The endo-atmospheric interceptor missile features a radio-frequency seeker and an advanced dynamic control system.

The BMD, in the first phase, has been conceived to take care of enemy missiles coming from a distance of 2,000 km. In the second phase it will take care of missiles with a range of 5,000 km. Its critical elements, dispersed across the country, include interceptor missiles, command, control, communication, computer and intelligence (C4I) systems, long-range radars and so on. Only the United States, Russia and Israel have BMD shields.

India's fleet of surface-to-surface missiles is helmed by the Agni series, Agni-I, II, III, IV and V, which are all strategic missiles armed with nuclear warheads and the bulwark of India's nuclear deterrence. The single-stage Agni-I has a range of about 750 km and the two-stage, 17-tonne Agni-II has a range of 2,000 km. Agni-III, weighing 50 tonnes, is a quantum jump and it can take out targets 3,000 km away. Agni-IV, with its motor casings made of composites, weighs only 17 tonnes and it can reach targets 4,000 km away. Agni-V, with a range of 5,000 km, is a ""game changer"", says Avinash Chander, former Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister and former DRDO Director General. The Army has deployed Agni-I, II, III and IV. Four consecutive flights of Agni-V have been successful, with the third and fourth launches taking place from canisters positioned on trucks.

The BMD and the strategic Agni series establish India as a formidable missile power in the world, says a DRDO missile technologist who did not want to be named.

In the SAM class, a success story is the development of the Akash missile. The Army and the Air Force possess it and both have placed production orders of more than Rs.20,000 crore for Akash, which can hit aircraft and helicopters flying 25 km away. ""The maturity of private manufacturing agencies in key defence applications is highlighted by the fact that about 85 per cent of the Akash missile systems is supplied by them,"" says Satheesh Reddy.

In 2016, DRDO began two new projects of Akash. The first one called Akash New Generation will feature solid propulsion, an electro-mechanical control system, an active radio-frequency seeker and a laser proximity fuse. The system can search, track and fire while engaging 10 targets that fly up to an altitude of 25 km. Akash New Generation has not been tested yet. The second, Akash-Mark 1S, will be tested in the technology demonstrator mode to upgrade the earlier version with an RF seeker.

A new indigenously developed Quick Reaction SAM (QRSAM) has been tested this year. It can search for targets on the move, track them on the move and fire at multiple targets that are flying 30 km away. According to DRDO sources, two advanced SAMs, one each for the Navy and the Air Force, will become operational soon. The Long Range SAMs (LRSAMS), with a range of 70 km, has been developed jointly by DRDO and the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) for the Indian Navy. The three destroyers of the Navy will soon boast of LRSAMs, the flight trials of which were conducted in September 2016 and were aimed at proving three interception scenarios against manoeuvring targets. A medium-range SAM has been developed jointly by DRDO and the IAI for the Air Force, and the flight trials took place in June and July 2016.

Astra, the air-to-air missile, with a capability to destroy aircraft flying in a range of up to 60 km, has been inducted into the Air Force on the Sukhoi-30. This indigenous missile, with variants for extended range, will provide the Air Force the fire power to engage targets at various standoffs.

India's underwater-launched K-15 missile has a range of 700 km, and flight trials of another underwater-launched missile, the K-4, with a range of 3,000 km, have taken place from submerged pontoons.

In the development of missiles, RCI, an avionics laboratory with a mandate to design and develop advanced avionics technologies, plays an important role. It has developed ""systems and sub-systems in the critical areas of navigation, control actuation systems, power supplies, imaging seekers, RF seekers, onboard computers, radomes and antennae, and so on,"" says Satheesh Reddy, who was formerly Director, RCI.

Indeed, with such an array of sophisticated laboratories, defence-related research looks set to conquer new frontiers that will help DRDO grow and expand its empire."
311,311,"e-Therapeutics has created a unique computer-based drug discovery platform

A way to develop new and better drugs quicker and more cheaply is what everyone wants.

Ray Barlow, e-Therapeutics PLC's (LON:ETX) chief executive, believes his company is pioneering a way to achieve this.

""We are firmly of the view that we have created a unique and sophisticated computer-based drug discovery platform, which is significantly more rapid and productive than other approaches available to the industry.""

Barlow has only been in charge for a few months, but has already undertaken a strategic review that has seen the focus on internal discovery projects narrowing from six to the two most commercially attractive.

He is also looking to out-license two of the other projects and to forming disease-specific partnerships with other industry players.

Network approach

Underpinning everything is e-Therapeutics' network-driven drug discovery (NDD) platform.

Networks are a rapidly growing area of drug research. Instead of focusing just on one gene mutation or single target, the network approach looks at the broader interactions within disease mechanisms.

E-Therapeutics' platform is founded on the ability to ""open the aperture"" and look at disease biology as an interconnected network. The in-silico part of the engine uses a very sophisticated computational approach enhanced with artificial intelligence tools and other state-of-the-art analytical approaches to build and analyse network models of disease'. The final part maps which compounds will have a positive impact on disease from a database of tens of millions of active compounds.

It's a meshing of computers and biology or as Barlow puts it: ""A unique method to interrogate biology to create new and better drugs in a more efficient and effective way.""

Currently it takes about 24 months to take a new drug from a concept to a hit, but using e-Therapeutics' computational techniques, Barlow reckons this can be cut to nine months or less, as well as bringing a whole range of ""novel and differentiated products to the table"".

Cancer the focus

""One of the challenges with a highly productive platform is choosing which programmes to develop yourself with the resources you have available,"" he said.

The two immuno-oncology (helping the patient's own body fight the cancer) products it will develop internallyare checkpoint signalling modulation and tryptophan breakdown.

Both are seeing significant research activity currently.

Checkpoint signalling modulation can increase the anti-tumour activity of immune cells, while tryptophan breakdown is aimed at preventing the suppression of T-cell responses in cancers.

Why those two?

Barlow, who joined from US giant Amgen, says the strategic review was carried out with help of a number of big pharma and biotech peers and a systematic analysis of data, market opportunity and unmet commercial and clinical need led to those two products being selected.

Licensing

The plan now is to find partners to help take other programmes to the next stage of preclinical development.

The company will take its Hedgehog tumour treatment and an anti-influenza programme to the industry as potential out-license opportunities and to help demonstrate the effectiveness of its NDD approach.

Publishing data

Another way to enhance NDD's reputation is to publish data on work carried out so far.

E-Therapeutics' platform has identified numerous molecules and data in diverse areas of biology and these will be published to validate further the network-driven discovery approach.

Any funding generated from this will go back into the platform to develop network models for other complex diseases such as neurodegeneration, fibrosis and triple negative breast cancer.

And that versatility is another plus of the NDD platform, says Barlow, with a multitude of complex and serious diseases open to investigation by the method.

Funding until 2019

At the end of January, cash was £14mln, since when e-Thera has received a tax credit of £2.8mln, and that should be sufficient to fund the company into 2019, according to research house Edison.

By that time, the aim is to have new deals in place.

Attendance at industry conferences, such as the recent AI Pharma event, and the publication of new data will highlight the abilities of the platform to support the partnership push.

""My first three months were internally facing, but now we will start having conversations with big pharma, engage with biopharmas, the new technology-based ""industry disrupters"" and generally go out into the world,"" Barlow said.

Barlow believes e-Therapeutics was ahead of its time in pioneering the network route, but now the industry is coming around to its way of thinking.

""Our network-driven view of biology and disease is gaining more and more attention in literature and the industry.

""We are looking forward to ride the wave at the amazingly exciting intersection of biology and technology.""

Other current period notable developments at Allied Minds plc

Jill Smith, President and CEO of Allied Minds, commented ""We have set out clear goals for the Group with the aim of sharpening capital allocation discipline, including: transitioning to thematic investing; securing earlier and broader syndication of investment partnerships for our portfolio companies where we see scope to validate and accelerate the path to commercialisation; and strengthening the governance and leadership of our portfolio companies. Actions undertaken since April across our investment, syndication and operating activities have been consistent with these objectives. We have also set out clear goals (MBOs) for our top six companies and ABLS, based on material and commercially relevant milestones, designed to bring about tangible progress towards commercialisation. In the short period of time since April, these subsidiaries have progressed well against their respective MBOs, with further achievements expected for the balance of the year. I look forward to building on these initial steps with the team as we continue to focus on our objective to drive shareholder value by realising liquidity events that deliver attractive returns for our investors and stakeholders, and accelerating the growth of our underlying business platform.""

With the measures being undertaken to enhance focus and capital allocation discipline, the Directors are confident of the Group's ability to accelerate the pace of new investments, and to drive material progress against commercialisation goals for its subsidiaries, with a view to unlocking successful liquidity events and realising shareholder value.

Simon's network and expertise will be invaluable as we transition to more thematic investing and extract more leverage from our origination platform to increase the cadence of new investments over time.

Secondly, we are committed to broadening our investment syndicate by bringing in strategic and independent financial investors wherever possible in Series A, B rounds and beyond where we see benefits in terms of validating the business model and de-risking the path to commercialisation. The Series A rounds for HawkEye 360 and BridgeSat completed in the first half of this year brought in valuable strategic co-investors, and going forward we expect most funding rounds beyond the initial investment to follow suit.

Third, we are implementing improvements to the management, operating support and governance of our subsidiaries. These include appointing stronger, more experienced management teams and operating boards, with clearer accountability and line of sight to the requirements to drive commercialisation and monetisation. The recent appointments of experienced CEOs at Spin Transfer Technologies and BridgeSat materially strengthen both these businesses. All companies have implemented changes to their boards and/or advisory boards, most notably at HawkEye 360, which includes leaders and executives that bring invaluable experience, access and commitment. The focus on material and commercially relevant MBOs (Management By Objectives) is creating greater clarity and urgency, providing the basis for a more transparent management process. All businesses have made progress against their MBOs and we expect further progress in the rest of 2017.

In all high performance early stage undertakings there are successful companies and others that do not realise the potential envisaged. A disciplined capital allocation approach demands that on an on-going basis, we objectively assess when and where to maintain or accelerate the growth of our businesses and determine when to cease, and when to pivot in response to changing circumstances. The restructuring earlier this year reflects this discipline, freeing up financial and human resources to focus on driving performance in our current portfolio and reallocating funds to continue building the foundations to accelerate the pace of new investments.

We are well capitalised to deliver on our plans, with a healthy cash runway and multiple potential options to deliver monetisation events over the medium term, in particular across the top six companies. In the ""Portfolio review"" section below we describe the progress of our portfolio companies over the first half of the year, and the milestones for the top six companies and ABLS for 2017.

During the first half of 2017, the Group invested $22.4 million into the Company's new and existing subsidiary businesses. An additional $1.6 million was raised from third party investors, in two subsidiary fundraisings. Allied Minds currently has majority ownership in, or operating control of, all of its subsidiary businesses.

BridgeSat, Inc. (BridgeSat) is working to deliver an advanced optical communications network with an initial focus on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. This network is designed to meet accelerating demand for high-bandwidth, frequent, cost effective data downlink capabilities driven by the need to transfer ever increasing amounts of data, currently inadequately serviced by RF spectrum based communications solutions. To speed the migration to optical communications, BridgeSat is developing a turnkey software based solution that seamlessly connects operators to their satellites and high-altitude unmanned vehicles via the BridgeSat ground network.

Federated Wireless, Inc. (Federated Wireless) extends the access of carrier networks by enabling the sharing of wireless spectrum amongst multiple tiers of users through an innovative cloud-based wireless infrastructure solution. The Federated Wireless platform or Spectrum Controller, consisting of a cloud based Spectrum Allocation System (SAS) and Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC), unlocks commercial access to spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band, called the Citizen's Band Radio Service (CBRS) that is owned by the U.S. military and is surplus to its requirements at a given point in time. Federated Wireless' innovative ESC technology was developed in conjunction with the Department of Defense. The ESC infrastructure is currently being rolled out and will comprise a network of several hundred sensors deployed along the U.S. coastlines able to detect surplus spectrum operated by the U.S. Navy. Once detected, spare spectrum can be allocated out via the SAS for use by individuals and enterprises located near the U.S. coastlines (the majority of the U.S. population). The allocation and management of spectrum employing a shared-economy model is potentially highly disruptive to the wireless service business as a whole, enabling new cable entrants, new low cost and secure private 4G/5G IoT networks, and high speed, low cost wireless broadband access.

HawkEye 360, Inc. (HawkEye 360) plans to operate a constellation of commercially developed small Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite clusters to conduct radio frequency (RF) survey and mapping and, using proprietary algorithms, to create geospatial information products for commercial and government customers. Potential applications include emergency response support (search and rescue), transportation and logistics tracking, spectrum interference and coverage mapping, support for global health and humanitarian initiatives such as identification of illegal fishing and human trafficking, and support of national and global security activities.

Spin Transfer Technologies, Inc. (STT) intends to deliver next-generation magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) memory chips that enable a new class of memory with fast write speeds, low power, non-volatility and high endurance. Mobile applications continue to demand higher density memories and lower power consumption and MRAM can satisfy both requirements, placing STT as well positioned to replace traditional embedded static random-access memory (SRAM) and larger stand-alone dynamic random access memory (DRAM). SRAM is an older, fast, high power and comparatively large memory used in most display and computing applications. MRAM's advantage is that it can be both smaller and lower power. STT is also targeting its MRAM technology as a replacement for DRAM, the main memory in most electronics, because of the power savings MRAM can offer. Target applications for STT's MRAM technology include storage products, mobile devices, microcontrollers, and a multitude of low-energy semiconductor products for the internet-of-things market. STT will commercialise its technology through two paths - by licensing its technology to major foundries and IDMs so that they may include MRAM blocks on their customers' chips, and by developing and selling stand-alone memory devices.

Existing prostate cancer diagnostics rely on biopsy procedures which are performed ""blind"", sampling 12-14 cores at random. Precision Biopsy's ClariCore™ live tissue identification technology directs the physician to sample only ""suspicious"" tissue, potentially increasing diagnostic yield and reducing by up to 90% the number of core samples subject to pathology and providing immediate feedback to biopsied patients. ClariCore may also improve cancer diagnosis and detection rates by enabling the urologist to probe extra locations, including the anterior prostate, when all previous biopsy locations have indicated as ""normal"". In addition, improving diagnostic yield leads to reduced repeat biopsy procedures which are burdensome on patients and increase costs.

Existing therapeutics for prostate cancer suffer in the same way as diagnostics from the inability to definitively localise the cancer tumour within the prostate. Precision Biopsy has filed patents to protect and is currently developing a three-dimensional prostate mapping system utilising a variation of the ClariCore system. It is intended that this mapping system will accurately identify the tumour and selected margins to allow for focal treatment of the affected area of the prostate, rather than the whole organ, using RF ablation, HIFU, cryoablation, radiation, or other focal therapy technologies such as drug injection. This could reduce the need for radical prostatectomy procedures and allow for preservation of healthy tissue. The company is also developing a focal therapy system which would enable the urologist to locally and focally ablate selective suspicious segments of the prostate utilising the ClariCore™ system to guide the therapy.

SciFluor Life Sciences, Inc. (SciFluor) aims to develop a best-in-class portfolio of compounds principally through the strategic use of fluorine. It engages in drug discovery and development and is building a portfolio of proprietary compounds seeking to serve various billion dollar markets. SciFluor has evolved its current portfolio by adding fluorine to drug compounds with the intention of improving potency, selectivity, rates of absorption, metabolic stability, and half-life. These factors all improve the specific drugs and can positively impact delivery, dosing, side effects and more. For reference, approximately 25% of drugs currently marketed or in the pipeline contain fluorine. SciFluor's principal products are based on two patented lead compounds:

Other companies including corporate partnerships

Whitewood Encryption Systems, Inc. (Whitewood) was formed based on quantum random number generation and quantum key management technologies created at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Whitewood is developing solutions for one of the most fundamental challenges associated with all modern cryptosystems - entropy management - or true random number generation required for security in quantum computing. Whitewood's products exploit quantum mechanics to meet demand for high-quality entropy used for random data and key generation at scale. Whitewood addresses operational vulnerabilities in any application that employs encryption, certificates and keys in clouds, devices and browsers. The company has recently introduced its first commercial Entropy-as-a-Service offering, netRandom Enterprise, to protect critical enterprise applications across data centres and networked devices.

Percipient Networks, LLC

Percipient Networks, LLC (Percipient) was created with technology licensed from the MITRE Corporation for protecting U.S. Government agencies from cyber attacks. Strongarm is a pure Software-as-a-Service offering, that helps businesses safeguard their assets, including sensitive customer information and valuable intellectual property, against malware threats without the need for enterprise-sized IT staff or security budgets. Strongarm targets the rapidly growing (12.8% CAGR) $100 billion Small-Medium Business network security market where the ease of set-up and low management overhead are essential.

Seamless Devices, Inc.

Seamless Devices, Inc. (Seamless) was created to commercialise Switched Mode Signal Processing (SMSP) technology licensed from Columbia University. Seamless uses SMSP to implement an advanced form of analogue to digital conversion (ADC). ADC is used in semiconductor devices to translate a real world sensor measurement into a digital representation that can be processed by computers. As process nodes in circuit designs continue to shrink, Seamless' SMSP technology gains advantages over conventional ADC methods by preserving a higher degree of signal fidelity (accuracy). The technology has the potential to serve a wide range of applications including consumer electronics, telecommunications hardware, instrumentation, network hardware, healthcare devices, transportation and military systems. Seamless is currently licensing its innovative product to customers developing custom ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) for advanced sensor systems.

Signature Medical, Inc. (Signature) is developing wearable devices using artificial intelligence and cloud-based audio technology to more effectively monitor and evaluate patients remotely who have suffered heart failure and other indications. Its lead Acousticare™ device, which is currently under development, could allow for better intervention and reduced hospital readmissions, improving outcomes for patients and reducing costs to the healthcare system. Heart failure ranks among the most prevalent and costly chronic diseases, consuming 1-2% of all healthcare expenditures in developed countries, and is the number one cause of hospitalisation among U.S. adults over the age of 65. Heart failure readmission rates are estimated to be approximately 25% within 30 days of hospital discharge. Signature raised a $2.5 million Series A preferred funding round, completed post period-end on 26 July 2017, including participation from Boston based Riot Ventures and Bose Corporation.

LuxCath, LLC

Based on technology originally sourced from George Washington University, LuxCath, LLC (LuxCath) is developing a proprietary ablation catheter technology to enable live, optical interrogation of heart tissue during cardiac ablation, allowing a cardiologist to assess on a real-time basis the impact of ablation therapy on targeted heart tissue. Current procedures are typically executed on a ""blind"" basis with the cardiologists unable to visually assess whether there is tissue contact before commencing ablation and unable to determine whether ablation has successfully killed target tissue, or left gaps between lesions which could lead to recurrence. LuxCath's technology can be applicable to all cardiac ablation procedures and is focused on Atrial Fibrillation (AF) ablation as its initial target market. It aims to improve clinical outcomes while reducing procedure times, fluoroscopy exposure, costs, and clinical recurrences. AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the U.S., affecting more than two million people and projected to affect 15.9 million in the year 2050, half of whom will be over 80 years old. AF has been implicated as a significant cause of strokes, thromboembolic events, and heart failure, costing the U.S. healthcare system billions of dollars annually.

Allied-Bristol Life Sciences, LLC (ABLS) is a drug discovery and development company created in August 2014 through a partnership between Allied Minds and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). The company's mission is to create novel drug candidates against serious diseases with large market potential. These include fibrosis, cardiovascular, immunosciences, immuno-oncology and oncology.

ABLS, through ABLS Capital, continues to maintain material capital commitments, mostly from external investors, to fund up to ten ABLS subsidiaries through the optimisation phase where pre-clinical development work is completed. The committed capital of up to $80 million is to be invested in concert with BMS' commitment of up to $20 million. ABLS-owned subsidiaries that successfully complete their initial feasibility programme are eligible to benefit from new investments made by ABLS Capital and BMS, to fund further pre-clinical drug development at such subsidiary through the optimisation phase. Successful completion of such lead optimisation programme at each ABLS subsidiary is the crucial next step prior to triggering BMS' right to acquire such subsidiary. Allied Minds and BMS remain committed to the ABLS model, which provides a mechanism to smooth the binary risk profile of drug development, and is assigning additional resource to the programme with the objective of increasing the cadence of new investments.

In September 2016, Allied Minds and GE Ventures announced signature of an agreement underlying a strategic alliance to jointly identify and invest in new and existing technologies developed from both innovation pipelines. Allied Minds has an exclusive right of first refusal to license certain technologies, chosen by GE, for the spin-out and commercialisation of that technology.

Through the open exchange of commercialisation candidates between Allied Minds and GE Ventures' technology licensing group, multiple promising candidates for eventual spin-out have been and continue to be reviewed. While there has not yet been agreement on a first formal spin-out, we continue to believe the relationship with GE Ventures will provide an opportunity for Allied Minds to form new entities based on the cutting-edge technologies developed by one of the world's leaders in technology innovation.

Ownership interests are as at 15 August 2017 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document) and are based upon percentage interest of issued and outstanding common shares and preferred shares (on an as-converted into voting common share basis); provided that for ABLS II and ABLS Capital the disclosed percentage represents the Company's direct or indirect economic interest

In April 2017 Allied Minds announced a restructuring plan, ceasing operations at seven subsidiaries: Biotectix; Cephalogics; CryoXtract; ProGDerm (dba Novare Pharmaceuticals); Optio Labs; RF Biocidics; and SoundCure/Tinnitus Treatment Solutions. Allied Minds determined that the path to commercialisation for these subsidiaries was unlikely to yield appropriate financial returns and that capital and management resource should be redirected to the most promising areas of the portfolio and to scaling our pipeline and partnerships. Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value (GSOAV) ascribed to these businesses was written down to zero.

The subsidiary does not represent a separate active portfolio company.

The principal risks and uncertainties surrounding the Group businesses are set out in detail on pages 31 through 36 in the Risk Management section of the Strategic Report included in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts. There have not been any significant changes in the nature of the risks set forth therein that will affect the next six months of the financial year, therefore, such risks are applicable to the remaining six months of the financial year.

Revenue was higher by $0.7 million, at $2.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (HY16: $1.3m), when compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase is primarily attributable to revenue from new contracts in 2017 at HawkEye 360 of $0.7 million and higher non-recurring engineering contract revenue at Federated Wireless of $0.3 million. These increases were offset in part by lower revenue from the companies included in the restructuring plan for which funding was discontinued in the first half of 2017. Cost of revenue at $3.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (HY16: $1.3m) was higher as a percentage of revenue, when compared to the same period in the prior year, mainly from inventory write-offs at RF Biocidics, CryoXtract, and SoundCure as a result of the restructuring.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by $5.4 million, to $31.2 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (HY16: $25.8m). Personnel related expenses increased by $2.6 million mainly due to the provision for severance payouts to the former executives. The reserve for the restructuring provision increased by $2.1 million at 30 June 2017, from nil at 31 December 2016. Non-cash charges for depreciation and amortisation increased by $2.2 million. These increases were offset in part by decreases in sales and marketing, travel, and other non-operating expenses in the first six months of the year.

Research and development (R&D) expenses decreased by $0.2 million, to $25.3 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (HY16: $25.5m). The decrease is mainly attributed to the lower activities and discontinued funding for the subsidiaries included in the restructuring plan in the amount of $3.1 million. This decrease is offset in part by higher development activities at BridgeSat (+$1.1m), HawkEye 360 (+$0.5m), Precision Biopsy (+$1.1m), and SciFluor (+$1.1m).

As a result of the above discussed factors, total comprehensive loss for the year increased by $5.9 million to $58.3 million for the six months ended 30 June 2017 (HY16: $52.4m).

Significant performance-impacting events and business developments reflected in the Group's financial position at the half year end include:

The Group's net cash outflow from operating activities of $53.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2017 (HY16: $48.6m) was primarily due to the net operating losses for the period of $58.3 million (HY16: $51.3m) and an increase in working capital and other finance costs of $2.9 million (HY16: $3.2m). The operating cash outflow was offset by adjustments for non-cash accounting entries such as depreciation, amortisation, and share-based expenses of $8.2 million (HY16: $6.0m).

The Group had a net cash inflow from investing activities of $8.8 million in the six months ended 30 June 2017 (HY16: $22.6m outflow). This inflow predominately reflected the maturity of fixed income securities totalling $9.3 million, as compared to $25.0 million during the same period last year. Purchases of property and equipment totalled $0.5 million (HY16: $2.1m), which were higher in the first half of 2016 as a result of the move of our corporate offices in May of 2016 and higher capital equipment purchases made by Spin Transfer Technologies during the same period last year.

The Group's net cash inflow from financing activities of $4.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2017 (HY16: $18.8m) reflects in part the net proceeds of $1.6 million from the financing rounds at HawkEye 360 and BridgeSat in the first half of 2017. Net proceeds from financing rounds in same period last year totalled $18.7 million as a result of the subsidiary financing events at Federated Wireless, ABLS Capital and HawkEye 360. Additionally, cash inflows from financing activities in the period included $2.0 million from borrowing on the new line of credit at Spin Transfer Technologies, offset by the final repayment of the CryoXtract note of $0.1 million. To these inflows also contributed $0.9 million proceeds from exercises of stock options and issuance of share capital at Allied Minds.

Total cash and deposits, including the investments in fixed income securities, in total reflecting the available funds to the Group for future investments decreased to $177.0 million at 30 June 2017 from $226.1 million at 31 December 2016. Cash and deposits held at the parent level were $113.3 million at 30 June 2017 down from $136.7 million at 31 December 2016."

You rely on them from the moment you wake up to when you turn off the lights at night. But are you really giving your eyes the care they deserve? We talked to Deeba Chaudri, OD, a New York City-based optometrist with LensCrafters, about her patients' biggest bloopers when it comes to taking care of their baby blues (or browns, greens, or hazels).

Here's what not to do to make sure your vision stays healthy well into your golden years.

Sleeping in contact lenses

There are two types of contacts that are FDA-approved for overnight wear, but Chaudri says even those can be risky. In fact, an American Academy of Ophthalmology study revealed that the risk of developing a corneal ulcer is 10 to 15 times greater in extended-wear contact lens users than those who only wear their contacts during the day. And don't even think about sleeping in any other type of contact lens. ""You're depriving your corneas of oxygen, and that's a great way to cause infection and encourage bacteria to grow,"" Chaudri says.

It's fine to take a 20-minute nap in your contacts, she says, but it's safer to take them out beforehand -- just in case you oversleep! If you do wake up to realize you're still sporting your lenses, don't try to take them out right away; if your eyes are dried out, you could actually pull the top layer of your cornea away with them. Instead, wait 20 to 30 minutes and lubricate with artificial tears before you remove the contacts. Then stick to glasses for the rest of the day.

Touching and rubbing your eyes

Whether you wear contacts or not, you're asking for trouble by unnecessary poking and rubbing your eyes. ""Sometimes your eyes itch and you have to rub, but it's best to keep the lid closed and only touch the outside of the eye,"" Chaudri says. Rubbing too hard can also lead to broken blood vessels and inflammation.

Another reason to keep your hands off? Your eyes are protected by mucous membranes -- moist tissue that can easily collect dirt and germs -- so they're a great place for bacteria to grow. ""If you shake someone's hand and then you rub your eyes, you're transmitting those germs and there's a good chance you can catch whatever cold he's got.""

Not getting annual eye exams

""A lot of first-time patients tell me 'I haven't had an eye exam in 12 years because my vision was 20/20 the last time I was checked,'"" Chaudri says. Vision changes aren't even the most important reason you should still see an eye doc every year, she says. ""It's about getting your overall eye health checked out: There are no pain receptors behind the eye, so if you have a broken blood vessel or a tumor back there, you would otherwise not know it until it starts to interfere with your vision, or worse.""

Staring at devices all day (and night)

Electronic screens, like those on our computers, tablets, and smartphones, emit blue light, which some eye doctors believe to be as harmful as the sun's ultraviolet rays. Plus, focusing on anything for hours on end can cause eye strain and headaches, Chaudri says.

""If I told you to run around Manhattan and not stop for hours, your calves would be pretty sore afterward, wouldn't they? Think about what your eyes are going through when you don't take a break from your computer all day,"" she says. Instead, follow the 20-20 rule: For every 20 minutes you look at a screen, take a 20-second break to look into the distance, refocus your eyes on something else, and make a conscious effort to blink -- you may not have been doing enough of it before!

Applying eyeliner to your waterline

Even though makeup artists often swear by putting liner on the inside of your lower lashes, Chaudri says it's actually quite risky. ""When you put liner inside your eye, you're mixing it with your tears,"" she explains. If you're wearing contacts, your lenses then get coated in tiny makeup particles, which can deprive your eyes of oxygen. And even if you're not wearing contacts, those makeup particles can also be carrying germs that can cause infection.

Liquid liners are especially dangerous, she adds, since the applicator tip sits in a tube that can harbor bacteria.Soft pencils are safer since they are continuously being worn down and a new ""tip"" is exposed, but she still recommends applying them outside the eye only.

Sleeping in your makeup

Hitting the sack without washing your face can do more than leave mascara stains on your pillow; it can also clog the glands around your peepers and lead to irritated skin, pimples, and even styes -- painful, raised bumps that can appear on or around the eyelids.

False lashes are a no-no in Chaudri's book, too. ""If you're sleeping in them and rubbing them, that glue can get into your cornea and lead to major inflammation.""

Using expired solution, lenses, or drops

There's nothing wrong with saving a slightly-past-its-prime bottle of contact lens solution, right? Actually, there could be. ""These solutions have cleansers that kill bacteria on your lenses, so you want to make sure all of those ingredients are still doing their job,"" Chaudri says.

The same thing goes for the lenses themselves, which sit in a sterile solution that can break down over time. Artificial tears and prescription eye drops also have expiration dates that you should pay close attention to, as well. And definitely don't rinse your contact case or store contacts in any liquid that's not sterile, like tap or distilled water; both have been associated with Acanthamoeba keratitis, a drug-resistant corneal infection.

Relying on redness-reducing drops

""My biggest pet peeve is the overuse of redness-reducing eye drops,"" Chaudri says. The kinds you buy in the drugstore contain vasoconstrictors, which shrink blood vessels and temporarily make your eyes appear less red. ""But they also contain preservatives and other chemicals that can make your problem even worse in the long run, and it's only a matter of time before you experience a rebound effect.""

If your eyes are constantly red or irritated, it's important to see an eye doctor who can get to the root of your problem, Chaudri says. He or she can recommend an over-the-counter product (like a moisturizing ""artificial tears"" drop) or suggest other forms of treatment.

Not wearing sunglasses year-round

""A lot of people think sunglasses are only for the summer, or that they're only for fashion purposes,"" Chaudri says. ""But wearing them in the winter can be even more important because the sun reflects off the snow.""

Failing to wear proper UV protection can result in corneal burns, skin cancer on the eyelids, and visible spots on the whites of the eyes. Make sure your glasses provide protection against UVA and UVB rays, advises Chaudri, and wear them whenever you're out in the sun."

A B.C. family is speaking out today hoping the thieves who stole their computers will return them.

They are concerned because the hard drives contained photos of their deceased son, Patrick, who passed away from cancer on Aug. 29, 2015.

The computers were taken when the family's vehicle was broken into during the first week of August in the 3900-block of 14th Street in Vernon. The vehicle is a black 2010 GMC Sierra pick-up truck with Alberta plate YKV 627.

Story continues below

Police say there was no damage to the vehicle and it was possibly accidentally left unlocked. Taken was a grey laptop bag containing a silver 17'' HP touchscreen laptop, a black 13'' Toshiba laptop and two external hard drives, one with two terabytes of storage, the other with four terabytes, both of unknown makes.

The Paterson family is hopeful in getting the stolen goods back, as they are all they have left to remember Patrick's last months' alive, in picture form.

Patrick would not want to have anybody sad or down about what was to ultimately take his life, he began a bucket list and he tried to achieve all he could before no longer being abler to leave the hospital,"" said Patrick's dad Dwayne. ""Patrick was able to marry his girlfriend and was able to travel with me to see his lifelong favourite football team the Denver Broncos play and saw his favourite player Payton Manning. This would be the last time Patrick and I shared father and son time together away from home.

Sadly the pictures of his last months, up to the last days of his life spent in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy, dialysis and surgeries are on the stolen hard drives and laptops. All this has opened up wounds that will never really heal and left us feeling the pain all over again. I am simply making a plea to all, to anyone who may know or hear anything or know about the computers and hard drives. I beg that they please return what little a father has left other than a broken heart.

Cpl. Dan Moskaluk with Southeast RCMP District says this is one of those cases where if someone wants to come forward and return the items to police, no questions will be asked.

Anyone wishing to return these items or who may have information about how police can retrieve them are asked to contact the Vernon RCMP at 250-545-7171 or via Crimestoppers at 1-800-222-8477."
318,318,"Do you wear runners, drink coffee or own a mobile phone? The chances are that these products cruised to you on a ship. In 2015, the global merchant fleet carried a record 10 billion tonnes of cargo, a 2.1% increase from the previous year.However, while it's an essential part of international trade, shipping also poses serious risks to the environment. Apart from damage caused by dredging shipping channels and the spread of marine pests around the world, there is also growing concern about pollution. According to a report from the European Union, international shipping contributes 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually. This is predicted to rise by between 50% and 250% by 2050.

As well as contributing to global warming, ship pollution includes toxic compounds and particles that cause a host of other health hazards. A 2016 Chinese-led study found the shipping boom in east Asia has caused tens of thousands of premature deaths a year, largely from heart and lung disease and cancer.

Commercial ships are designed to be used for a long time. As a result, their engines are typically older and less efficient than those used in many other industries, and replacing them is prohibitively expensive. But there are some immediate solutions to this problem that use existing technology: increasing fuel quality, treating engine emissions, and adopting other energy-conservation measures so that ships burn less fuel.

When diesel ship engines burn poor-quality fuel, their smoke stacks release oxides of nitrogen and sulphur as well as carbon. These pollutants, as well as contributing to greenhouse warming, are highly toxic. Sulphur dioxide readily dissolves in water, creating acid rain that causes harm to both people and the environment.

Refinement of crude oil removes sulphur, which reduces the amount of sulphur dioxide produced when the fuel is burned. Higher-grade diesel also reduces the volume of heat-trapping nitrous oxide but is more expensive to produce because it requires more purification at the refinery.

The International Maritime Organization, the UN body that regulates the safety and security of shipping, is planning to reduce the amount of sulphur allowed in fuel. However, it is currently considering whether the change will take place in 2020 or will be deferred to 2025.

Clean fuel is an important part of reducing emissions, but the higher cost of low-sulphur fuel will deter many companies. Another way for ships to meet clean-air requirements is by capturing engine exhaust and passing it through scrubbers. These scrubbers convert nitrous oxide gases into harmless nitrogen and water.

This process requires retrofitting older ships and updating the design of new ship exhaust systems. One advantage of this approach is that it allows ships to meet the different pollution regulations around the world without having to swap fuels.

Another way to reduce production of nitrous oxide is by reducing the temperature at which diesel fuel burns, but this leads to decreased fuel efficiency and increased fuel consumption. Scrubbers are potentially a cheaper and more accessible option.

Ships don't just burn diesel fuel to propel themselves through the water. Fuel also generates electricity so that people on board can do things like use computers and read at night.

To increase fuel efficiency, other energy conservation measures can be adopted so that ships burn less fuel and decrease their emissions. The US Navy's Green Fleet has, for example, replaced their old light fixtures with energy-saving LEDs.

They have also undertaken a temperature control initiative, where thermostats have been checked to ensure they are in proper working order and faulty parts in their water cooling systems replaced. Some ships have gone further and installed stern flaps that modify the flow of water under the ship's hull to reduce drag, thus increasing fuel efficiency.

All of this means the shipping industry can lower its fuel bill through conserving energy, and at the same time reduce its negative impacts on the health of humans and the planet. With more than 20,000 ships in the global fleet, these immediate solutions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other types of pollution will make a real difference.

319,319,"(Cycle Computing cofounder and CEO Jason Stowe looking happy after Microsoft bought his company.Cycle Computing)

Microsoft has acquired a startup called Cycle Computing for an undisclosed sum. Cycle Computing's software allows companies to run massively huge apps in the cloud, a profitable area for cloud vendors.Cycle was an early partner with AWS and Google and its customers will be asked to move to Microsoft's cloud.

In a bit of a coup in the cloud computing world, Microsoft on Tuesday announced that it bought a startup called Cycle Computing for an undisclosed sum.

Cycle may not have the name recognition of some of its better-known tech peers, but the startup has played a crucial role in creating today's cloud computing industry. When businesses swipe a credit card today and instantly get access to unlimited supercomputing power, it's in large part thanks to Cycle.

Cycle Computing gained nationwide attention in 2012 when its technology transformed Amazon's then nascent Web Services into a supercomputer boasting the equivalent of 50,000 individual computers.

Scientists were trying to find potential new cancer drugs and they used Cycle's software to simultaneously run their app across tens of thousands of virtual computers in Amazon's datecenters. (Specifically, they used 6,700 Amazon EC2 instances to create a 51,132-core computer -- with each core is basically equivalent to a single computer). The setup was so powerful that it cost researchers $5,000 to run their AWS app for just one hour.

It was an early proving project for Amazon's AWS business which, back in 2012, was still trying to convince enterprises to give it a go. This project was pointed out by Amazon's cloud genius Werner Vogels as one of his most proud moments to date, he told Business Insider at the time.

In the years since, Cycle Computing grew to be used by all three of the big cloud vendors, AWS, Google and Microsoft Azure. Plus, a bunch of competitive products came onto the market that also let virtual cloud computers work together as if it were one massive supercomputer.

A grab for AWS, Google customers

Flash forward to 2017 and there's now an entire market of such products called ""cloud orchestration,"" complete with its own consortium under the Linux Foundation, the ""Cloud Native Computing Foundation"" of which Cycle was a founding member. CNCF has grown so powerful that Microsoft and AWS bowed and joined it last week.

Microsoft did not disclose the terms of the sale and it's hard to guess because Cycle Computing was unusual in another way: it was bootstrapped, taking on zero VC funding. Cycle raised $1 million in debt financing in 2016.

The founders ""started Cycle twelve years ago on an $8,000 credit card,"" founder and CEO Jason Stowe said in a blog post on Tuesday announcing the news.

So this could have been sweet exit for them and their employees, who own 100% of the company. Or it could have been an aqui-hire fire sale.

There's some reason to believe it was a happy exit. Cycle claims Novartis and NASA as marquee customers as well as a list of unnamed top companies in manufacturing, life insurance, pharma and biotech, media and financial services/hedge funds. Stowe says that all told, its customers are using the product to run the equivalent of ""1 billion core-hours this year, growing at 2.7x every 12 months,"" in other words, a billion hours of computing time and growing.

But here's the clincher: while Microsoft says it will continue to support all of Cycle's customers on their original cloud of choice like AWS or Google Cloud, future Cycle customers won't be given that option. The software will live on Azure. And existing Cycle customers will be asked to move to Azure.

Microsoft says: ""We will continue to support Cycle Computing clients using AWS and/or Google Cloud. Future Microsoft versions released will be Azure focused. We are committed to providing customers a seamless migration experience to Azure if and when they choose to migrate.""

And that's why this is brilliant. These are huge application that use a lot of cloud services and rack up big cloud computing bills. Microsoft is trying to boost usage of its cloud Azure. With this acquisition it gets to do that, while also encouraging AWS and Google customers to jump ship.

Tempest in a teapot: How a 15-year-old rallied programmers to save one of the web's oldest jokes

I've reviewed every Microsoft Surface for two years -- here's why I'm not worried by the Consumer Reports downgrade

Intel is building a fleet of 100 self driving cars and it wants to start testing them this year"
320,320,"Judith Cameron's 91-year-old dad is in decline, and she's concerned she can't always be there for him. But he says he's in good health and doesn't need her to worry so much about him

'But I remember something when it's important,"" Dad protests. We're sitting in his back garden on a warm summer's afternoon. ""If you've forgotten it, how do you know if it's important?"" I ask. ""Don't treat me as if I was your child."" He turns back to his newspaper and I sigh.

His last remark stops my cajoling and I concentrate on pouring our cups of tea. We both know that my daughter Sophie needed full-time care following a rare brain infection and that she died just a couple of months before my mum's death in 2006. Indeed, I wrote a column for this newspaper, Who Cares?, about life as a carer. I know that my dad isn't consciously comparing the relationships, but it still resonates. And in a broad sense, there are similarities.

In the same way that, however painful, I had to accept the fact that Sophie could never recover, I have to accept that, due to old age, Dad is in decline. Nevertheless, when Sophie came home from hospital I did my best to ensure that she had as good a life as possible. And now that Dad is becoming less able, I want him to have as good a life as possible. He does, too, but we don't always agree on how this can be achieved.

Dad was widowed after 60 years of marriage, and having been born into a large working-class family had never before slept in a bedroom on his own. In addition to coping with the grief of losing his wife, he had to face life living alone for the first time at the age of 80. But he was in strong physical shape and had no desire to move in with any of his children or leave the home he loved. Instead, he had the good fortune to meet a new companion and although she did not live locally, they spent much of the following 10 years together. But she too is older and now prefers to be in her own home rather than in his. Dad still stays with her frequently, but finds the journey more arduous and, despite regular visits to and from family members, often spends extended periods of time at home alone.

When my grandparents grew old and became widowed, my parents and several of their siblings lived nearby, but I live 100 miles away from my dad and yet I am still closer than either of my brothers. This seems to be the norm nowadays and we are not alone among our friends in trying to care for a parent from afar.

Until 18 months ago, Dad took pride in finishing the cryptic crossword, being able to walk a mile comfortably and undertaking all necessary shopping on foot. He could also keep the house relatively well together and hold his own in any political argument. But it was almost as if his 90th birthday heralded the beginning of the end, when both mind and body decided they had had enough. Dad entered a slow decline that none of us initially saw or wanted to acknowledge. Gradually, the daily stroll to the newsagent became an endurance test and the quick crossword demanded his full attention. He finally accepted his need for hearing aids, but wearing them was another matter and so political discussions became a thing of the past.

Last November, Dad had a pacemaker fitted as breathlessness meant he struggled to walk more than very short distances without a rest. I accompanied him for the efficient and successful day surgery at Hammersmith hospital and we all hoped it would enable him to resume a more active lifestyle. Sadly that didn't happen, and as a result Dad feels it unimportant if he misses follow-up appointments.

""I did go once,"" he says, ""but it made no difference. I still get puffed out just getting dressed in the morning.""

Although I can remind him about appointments I can't always be there for them and, given his memory lapses, there is no guarantee he will attend. As things stand, I don't have the right to phone the hospital to discuss his health unless he is beside me to give permission. When I last visited and suggested this, we rang and waited several minutes for the cardiology department to respond, and then it was with a recorded message.

Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA) were registered soon after Dad became widowed, but it is only now, due to his memory loss, that I'm discovering their use. I have found that the property and finance LPA is relatively straightforward because we can both make decisions and payments as necessary. Nevertheless, when we recently tried to arrange online banking for me to directly use his account to cover his outgoings, any correspondence still had to be posted to his address. I wasn't there to receive the letter with the access code and, having forgotten what it was for, he discarded it. The bank assures me a repeat letter was sent, but it is nowhere to be found and a third one has been requested.

Other online services have been more successful, with a blue badge and a disabled parking space immediately in front of his house easily organised through the local authority's website. Similarly, the government's attendance allowance form was simple and completed online, before being printed off to sign and post to the Department for Work and Pensions.

The health LPA can only be triggered if a health professional considers a person incapable of making a rational decision. There is no period of joint authority and when I suggest that a regular check-up would be a good idea, Dad declines. He is proud that he has not needed to visit his GP for many months and I can't persuade him otherwise.

I also think an assessment of his care needs through the local authority's adult social services department is a good idea. This would put him on their radar as well as ensure that his home environment is as safely appointed as possible for his continued independence. But again he declines.

It is almost as if, perhaps subconsciously, Dad thinks that by shunning the professionals, he can avoid the frailty almost inevitably involved in growing old.

""I think I'm living too long,"" he sometimes grumbles, but then immediately lightens up, ""but I'll do my best to make 100!""

Dad can still be good company, but then acts inappropriately or becomes belligerent and rude without seeming to be aware of it. He has never been afraid to speak his mind, but I recently suggested that he now appears unconcerned about the feelings of others.

""You may be right,"" he said, ""it's not important to me if other people are over-sensitive.""

On this occasion, as I hand him his cup of tea, I put forward that we are not of the same opinion with regard to what is or isn't important.

""I think it's quite normal for children and their parents to disagree,"" he says.

""That's true,"" I reply, reaching for my own cup. But I'm starting to realise that to ensure his remaining life is as good as possible, my brothers and I may eventually have to become the parents in the relationship.

Charles Davis, Judith's father

I have enjoyed a long, happy life and been extremely fortunate in so many ways throughout it. I was my parents' 10th child and won a scholarship to Kilburn grammar school, a couple of miles from my home in Willesden.

The school was evacuated during the war, but I stayed behind and witnessed the whole conflict from my bedroom window. I found the London blitz thrilling and, as is the wont of the young, never considered my own life to be in danger during such excitement.

Although my schooling came to an end when I was only 14, it afforded me the opportunity to take an engineering apprenticeship. Through this I went on to be involved in the manufacturing of everything from paper-clips, screws and nails to aircraft, trucks, buses and ocean-going ships. I was privileged to have had such an interesting career. Most importantly, aged just 18, on an evening during the blackout, I met a beautiful young girl called Beryl. She became my wife, my lover, my best friend and mother to our five children. I always knew I was lucky to share my life with such a wonderful woman and when I lost her to cancer after 60 years of happy marriage, I wished my life could be over too. The only good thing about losing Beryl was the knowledge that she wouldn't have to go through the pain of losing me.

However, that time immediately after Beryl's death did demonstrate the kindness of my neighbours. Florett, a lovely Jamaican woman who lives opposite and was always a good friend, became even more concerned for me. Sarah, a single mother who lives next door, brought me meals, and so many other people, from all different backgrounds as is typical of Londoners, found time for me and invited me into their homes.

My children tried to console me, but I became increasingly lonely until the following year when I met Yvonne, a widow who shared my tastes in music and politics as well as an interest in travel. We've enjoyed many happy times together and several holidays. However, she now prefers to stay in her village with her family close by rather than travelling. I still like my own home and being in London so even if Yvonne agreed to have me, I wouldn't want to leave my city.

Driving has always given me pleasure and I visit Yvonne regularly, but we both realise that this will eventually become more difficult. I get breathless and can no longer walk great distances so my car is very important for my independence. I have never made a claim on its insurance, but I am unfairly penalised due to my age and it is prohibitively expensive. I now have a blue badge and a permanent parking place just outside my house, which my daughter Judith organised and which is very useful. Otherwise, I feel I'm in very good general health. Since my cataracts were removed a few years ago I can read without glasses, and being a bit deaf can be a blessing at times. My knees are stiff and I get aches and pains, but I don't let them get me down.

I do struggle with computers, so Judith and her brothers are doing more for me as time goes by. I'm lucky to have them and grateful for their care, although I think they worry about me more than they need to.

At 91 I don't fear death, but still enjoy life. I'm proud to be working-class and feel lucky to have had the variety of experiences I've enjoyed. It seems amazing that my life started soon after man's first success of powered flight and has lasted long after man first walked on the moon. So long as I remain reasonably fit in mind and body, I shall continue to enjoy life and make 100.my life started soon after man's first success of powered flight and has lasted long after man's first walk on the moon. So long as I remain reasonably fit in mind and body, I shall continue to enjoy life and make 100."
321,321,"In the early 1970s, the Salkinds -- son Ilya and father Alexander -- acquired the rights to do a Superman movie. While there were plenty of TV movies and pilots and series and such that had been done throughout this decade starring costumed heroes -- Wonder Woman, Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Dr. Strange, all of which we'll get to in due course -- there hadn't been a theatrically released comic-book superhero film since Batman in 1966, and even that was tied to a TV show. The Salkinds, though, wanted Superman on the big screen.

Superman had remained the most visible superhero in the world into the 1970s. Besides continuing to be DC's flagship comics character, he was the subject of a Broadway play (It's a Bird... It's a Plane... It's Superman), which was made into an awful ABC special in 1975 starring David Wilson (who played the man of steel as kind of a demented Ted Koppel). Marvel and DC's first intercompany crossover happened in 1976 and teamed Superman with Spider-Man in a classic comic by Gerry Conway and Ross Andru, not to mention the epic Superman vs. Muhammad Ali.

For years, the Salkinds worked to get their production going. William Goldman and Leigh Bracket were both approached to write the screenplay, and then Ilya actually hired Alfred Bester -- Hugo Award-winning author and former comic book writer (he's the one who wrote the famous Green Lantern oath) -- to do it, and man, do I want to live in the parallel universe where that happened. In our universe, Alexander overrode his son and instead hired Mario Puzo, because he was much better known. Looking back four decades, it's hard to imagine any circumstance under which anyone would think the author of The Godfather was a better choice for a superhero film than the author of The Stars My Destination, but whatever.

The Salkinds' list of possible stars for the film -- whether in the title role, as Jor-El, or as Lex Luthor -- is an impressive who's who: Muhammad Ali, James Brolin, Charles Bronson, James Caan, Clint Eastwood, Dustin Hoffman, Bruce Jenner, Perry King, Kris Kristofferson, Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Nick Nolte, Al Pacino, Robert Redford, Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Lyle Waggoner, Christopher Walken, and Patrick Wayne (who was actually cast, but dropped out when his father John -- yes, that John Wayne -- contracted cancer). In the end, while A-list actors Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman took on the roles of Jor-El and Luthor, respectively, they went with an unknown, Christopher Reeve to play Supes. Amusingly, Reeve was suggested early in the process by the casting director, but was rejected by director Richard Donner as being too young and skinny. This led to a Superman film where Jor-El and Lex Luthor had pre-title billing, while the title character was relegated to third billing after the title.

Donner, by the way, was one of another impressive list of possible directors considered, among them Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin, Richard Lester (who wound up taking over from Donner, more on that in a bit), Peter Yates, John Guillerman, Ronald Neame, Sam Peckinpah (who was dropped from consideration when he pulled out a gun during a meeting with the Salkinds), George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg. (Amusingly, Alexander was skeptical of hiring Spielberg, wanting to see how Jaws did first; when Jaws was a hit, Spielberg was in too much demand to be available. Irony!)

The original plan was to film the first two movies simultaneously, and Puzo's original screenplay was to cover both movies. Having said that, Puzo turned in a 550-page screenplay (the average movie is around 125 or so), and several writers both credited (David & Leslie Newman and Robert Benton) and not (Tom Mankiewicz, given a ""creative consultant"" credit, and George MacDonald Fraser, who said he did very little work) were brought in to curb the script's excesses both in tone and length.

From this development process, chaotic even by the high standards of Hollywood, we got a series of Superman movies. And the chaos continued, as Donner quit in disgust after having filmed about three-quarters of the second film. Richard Lester -- originally hired as a go-between once Donner stopped talking to the Salkinds -- replaced him, re-shooting large swaths of the second movie. Lester was brought back to helm the third film. Hackman didn't return for the third, and Margot Kidder's role as Lois Lane was reduced to a glorified cameo (despite her getting better billing in number three), and rumors have persisted that they were marginalized due to their siding with Donner. Those rumors were helped by the fact that Hackman returned and Kidder's role returned to prominence in the fourth film, after the Salkinds had sold off the rights to Cannon Films.

That fourth film was, like the third, a disappointment both critically and financially, and it signaled the end of the Superman films for the time being.

These two films were conceived simultaneously, at least partly filmed simultaneously, and intended to be released one year apart. (The title card at the end of the first movie said to expect Superman II next year.) While that didn't go as planned (Donner's ouster and Lester's re-shoots of the second film added a year and a half or so to the process), the two movies do work as a kind of single extended storyline...

We open on the planet Krypton, with Jor-El prosecuting three revolutionaries who are convicted of treason and sent to the Phantom Zone. Their leader, General Zod, boasts that some day Jor-El will kneel before him, as will his heirs. He's half right...

After Zod, Ursa, and Non are sent off to the Phantom Zone (a flat square in which the trio can be seen to be trapped, a very low-key but effective bit of SFX), Jor-El tries to convince the council that the world is about to explode. The council thinks it's just a normal shifting of orbit, thus proving that nobody writing the script understands anything about astronomy (shifting orbit is kind of a big deal). Jor-El and his wife Lara put their infant son Kal-El into a small ship and trundle him off to Earth, where he'll be powerful, and the many-years journey through space (allegedly through many galaxies, also showing that nobody writing the script understands anything about astronomy) has him being educated by the ship.

Kal-El's ship crashes outside of Smallville, Kansas, where the toddler is rescued by Jonathan and Martha Kent, who raise him as their own, naming him Clark. They know from jump he's different -- not five minutes after they rescue him, he lifts their car with his bare hands -- but he keeps that light under a bushel for the most part. Jonathan tells his teenage son -- annoyed at not being able to be on the football team (which would, it should be pointed out, be horribly unfair) -- that his gifts are for a higher purpose, not to score touchdowns. Right after that, Jonathan dies of a heart attack.

After the funeral, Kent takes a crystal from the ship he came to Earth in and is compelled to go north. He reaches the Arctic, er, somehow and throws the crystal into the snow, which then constructs a giant Krytponian fortress. An AI that mimics Jor-El teaches him, basically, everything over the course of twelve years, and then Kent flies off in his familiar Superman outfit.

Kent moves to Metropolis and gets a job at the Daily Planet as a reporter, er, somehow. He meets Lois Lane and is smitten, and surreptitiously saves her life from a mugger's bullet. He later introduces himself as Superman by saving Lane from a helicopter crash, and then proceeds to stop a couple of robberies and rescue a cat from a tree. Everyone wants to know who this guy is, and he decides to give Lane the exclusive interview, and also takes her flying. (He comes within a hairsbreadth of revealing that he's also Kent, but chickens out.)

From his headquarters underneath the city, Lex Luthor and his henchfolk, Otis and Eve Tessmacher, plot their latest scheme, a violent real-estate scam. He's buying up cheap land in the Nevada desert, then will commandeer a couple of missiles to hit the San Andreas fault and sink California into the ocean (""like the mystics and statistics say it will""), thus making his new acquisitions valuable beachfront property.

He also gets his hands on some Kryptonite that is in a meteor that crashed in Addis Ababa. Using a special frequency that only Superman (and dogs) can hear, Luthor summons Superman to his lair and hits him with the Kryptonite. With the deadly rock slowly killing him and rendering him helpless, Luthor tosses him into a pool.

Luthor only needs one missile to sink California, so he sends the other one to Hackensack, New Jersey.* However, Tessmacher's mother lives in Hackensack, so she goes behind Luthor's back and removes the Kryptonite (but not before kissing Supes first), freeing him to stop both missiles. Hackensack is saved, but the missile actually strikes San Andreas before he can get there. However, he is able to repair the fault and save several lives.

*Digression: I first saw this film in the theatre at the age of nine when my aunt took me to see it. We saw the movie in a theatre in Hackensack, and when Luthor revealed the target of the second missile, we all lost it in the theatre. And when he stopped the missile, we cheered particularly loudly, as Superman had just saved all of us...

One life he can't save, though, is Lane's, as an aftershock buries her car with her in it. However, Superman, unable to face a world without her, manages to go back in time so he can save her. Sure.

Once everyone is safe, Superman takes Luthor and Otis to prison.

Later, Lane travels to Paris to do a story on terrorism, and terrorists take over the Eiffel Tower, threatening to destroy it with a hydrogen bomb. Superman flies across the Atlantic, saves Lane, stops the terrorists, and tosses the H-bomb into space. However, the bomb's shockwave hits the Phantom Zone trap, and Zod, Ursa, and Non are freed. They go to the moon first, destroying a moon lander and killing the three astronauts. They then proceed to Earth where they terrorize a small town and eventually travel to D.C. where they force the president to abdicate to them.

Superman misses all this because Kent and Lane are assigned to a story in Niagara Falls, and Lane finally figures out that Kent is Superman. Kent denies it at first, but eventually he capitulates, and flies her to the Arctic to show her the Fortress of Solitude. He then relinquishes his powers so they can have sex. (Really, that's the only explanation that makes sense, since they hop into bed right after he de-powers. It has to be that that was the only way for them to safely copulate. Obviously somebody read ""Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex""...)

They head back southward from the Arctic, er, somehow. En route, they stop in a diner, where a trucker takes Kent's seat, and when Kent attempts to take it back the trucker beats the shit out of him. Right after that, they find out about Zod and the crew, and Kent realizes he has to get his powers back, even though the AI that now mimics Lara because Marlon Brando was too expensive to get back for another film told him that the process was irreversible. So he goes back to the Arctic, er, somehow, and reverses the irreversible, er, somehow.

Luthor -- who escaped from prison thanks to Tessmacher, and invaded the Fortress of Solitude, thus learning most of Superman's background, including all about Zod and his gang -- works his way to the White House to tell Zod that he can give him the son of Jor-El. Zod takes the Daily Planet hostage, as kidnapping Lane is the best way to call Kal-El out, and sure enough, Supes shows up and they duke it out -- first all over the streets of Metropolis, and then Superman leads them north to the Fortress. They bring Luthor along, as well as Lane as a hostage.

That last part was clever, as Superman surrenders rather than allow Lane to be hurt. Zod also tells Ursa and Non to kill Luthor. Luthor tries to suck up to Superman now that they're both on the hit parade, and Superman whispers about the power-removing thingie to him. Luthor turns around and betrays Supes by telling Zod about it, and they put Supes back in the box that will again take his powers away. However, Superman reversed the polarity (or whatever) before company arrived, and so the effects are now outside the box instead of inside it. Zod, Ursa, and Non are now normal, and Superman kills all three of them in cold blood. (Well, to be fair, he only actually kills Zod. Lane kills Ursa, and Non just falls into a chasm on his own.)

Lane is having trouble handling being in a relationship with Superman, as she knows he'll be in danger all the time. When Kent asks what he can do, she says, ""Say you love me."" Instead, he kisses her and, without her consent, gives her super-amnesia. He didn't even say he loved her, the bastard. She no longer remembers anything after Niagara Falls.

Superman goes back to the diner in order to beat the crap out of the trucker, which is spectacularly petty and unworthy of him, then he puts the flag back on top of the White House (Zod removed it forcibly) and promises the president that he won't let him down again.

A completely absurd Rube Goldberg sequence ensues over the opening credits involving a seeing-eye dog abandoning a blind person (which would never happen), phone booths being knocked over like dominoes, wind-up penguins wandering the streets, people falling into construction holes, and other weirdness that toes the line between slapstick and dangerous. None of it has any bearing on the plot.

Lane is off to Bermuda for vacation, and Kent heads back to Smallville for his high school reunion, though for him it's a working trip, as he's going to write about small-town life and going home again for the first time in years. Jimmy Olsen goes with him to take pictures.

En route, they encounter a chemical fire, which Superman puts out, though Olsen breaks his leg trying to get pictures. In particular, Superman stops the fire before an acid can heat up. At room temperature, it's inert, but when it's heated it turns into an acid that can eat through anything. This will probably be important later.

He then goes to his reunion, where he's reunited with Lana Lang, whom he had a crush on in high school. She married the prom king, had a kid, then divorced him, leaving her a single mother in a town where the only eligible bachelor is an asshole. As Kent's urging, she considers a move to Metropolis.

A down-on-his-luck schlub named Gus Gorman takes a correspondence course in computer programming and discovers he has a tremendous aptitude for it. He gets a job working for industrialist Ross Webster as a low-level programmer, and he manages to embezzle more than $85,000. This comes to Webster's attention, and he decides not to prosecute Gorman, but instead to employ him more directly. He has Gorman reprogram a weather satellite that apparently can affect weather, er, somehow to hit Colombia with a tornado that will destroy the coffee crop, thus giving Webster a monopoly on non-Colombian coffee, which he controls. (Colombia was holding out.) However, Superman saves the South American nation.

Webster decides he must destroy Superman, so he has Gorman use the satellite to examine Kryptonite so they can fabricate a batch and kill Superman. However, there's an element the satellite can't recognize, so their Kryptonite is imperfect. It doesn't kill Superman, but it does make him evil. He stops saving people, straightens the leaning tower of Pisa (thus badly damaging tourism in that Italian city), trashes a bar, and just generally makes an ass of himself. Webster uses his masseuse, Lorelei, to seduce him and get him to aid in his plan to control the world's oil -- Gorman stops all the drills and sends all the oil tankers to the mid-Atlantic via computer, er, somehow. The one tanker that refuses to comply with the order, Lorelei sends Superman to trash, causing a major oil spill.

Lang's kid sees Superman at one point and urges him to be good again, and it's enough to cause a crisis of conscience. Superman and Kent have an endless semi-virtual fight in a junkyard and Kent emerges victorious. However, Webster has built a super-computer that Gorman designed that can defend itself against any attack. From there, Webster tries to kill Superman, but it doesn't work. Gorman tries to pull the plug, but the computer is able to draw power from elsewhere. Superman flies back to Smallville and retrieves the acid, which the computer reads as harmless. Then Superman opens the canister and heats it up, causing it to eat through the computer, destroying it.

Webster and his cronies are sent to jail, but Superman lets Gorman go for some inexplicable reason. He re-leans the tower and cleans up the oil spill. Lane returns from her Bermuda vacation with a big story about corruption in the Caribbean to discover that Lang is now working as a secretary at the Planet.

Superman IV: The Quest for Peace

Written by Christopher Reeve, Lawrence Konner, and Mark Rosenthal

Directed by Sidney J. Furie

Produced by Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus

Original release date: July 24, 1987

Superman saves the lives of some cosmonauts in space whose orbiter is threatened by debris, then returns to terra firma to find out that a tabloid monger named Warfield has bought the Daily Planet and plans to turn it into the same kind of sleazy rag he specializes in. He puts his daughter Lacy in charge, though she's slightly less of a scum-sucking weasel than her father, and also has a crush on Kent.

Kent is selling the family farm, and he finds a Kryptonian crystal that can do one big thing and then go inert. It's the last gasp of his Kryptonian assistance, and will probably be important later.

A kid writes a letter to Superman care of the Planet asking Superman to do something about all the nuclear weapons. The president has just announced that a recent summit with the Soviet Union went south, and they're going to have to make sure their nuclear arsenal is far stronger and more powerful than ever. (Ahem.) Superman doesn't like this, and he agonizes about it for some time. He reveals his true identity to Lane again and takes her flying so he can discuss this in depth with her -- and then he kisses her into amnesia again, which makes you wonder how many times he's done this.

He marches to the United Nations and announces to the General Assembly that he's removing all nuclear weapons from the Earth. This is met, not with outrage and (justifiable) accusations of Superman being a terrorist, but instead raucous applause. Okay, then.

Luthor escapes from prison with the aid of his nephew Lenny, whom Luthor describes as ""the Dutch elm disease on my family tree."" He then gathers a consortium of arms dealers to restock the nuclear weapons that Superman is regularly tossing into the sun.

In addition, Luthor steals a lock of Superman's hair from a museum that the man of steel donated it to and creates a Superman clone that looks nothing like Superman called the Nuclear Man, who is as powerful as Supes, but has Luthor's voice. Luthor lures Superman to his lair the same way he did in the first movie (which takes Supes away from a ridiculous dinner date involving both him and Kent, as well as Lane and Lacy) and then the two men of steel duke it out all across the world. The Nuclear Man takes out the Great Wall of China; Superman repairs it with his wall-repairing vision (yes, really). The Nuclear Man activates the volcano outside Pompeii; Superman plugs it with a piece of another mountain. The Nuclear Man steals the Statue of Liberty and throws it at midtown; Superman catches it and puts it back, but not before the Nuclear Man scratches him, making him sick.

Luthor betrays his consortium and uses the Nuclear Man to threaten Metropolis. Superman uses his Krypton ex machina to restore himself and then he beats up the Nuclear Man some more, saving Lacy's life in the process, as the Nuclear Man kidnaps her and takes her toward the moon before being too far from the sun deactivates him. Somehow, Lacy doesn't die in the vacuum of space, and Superman rescues her, then places the Nuclear Man in a power planet, where he provides energy for the world, er, somehow.

Superman then holds a press conference saying that the world has to help itself and he can't interfere. Okay, then. Perry White buys the Planet back, Luthor is back in jail, and Lenny's in a school for boys.

It's funny, one of the (justified) digs against Zack Snyder's interpretation of Superman in Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice is that Superman acts out of character. Supes is a hero, not a mopey, angst-ridden person who would snap Zod's neck or just stand there when the Capitol Building is blown up.

Those arguments tend to long for the good ol' days when Christopher Reeve was Superman, which sounds good, but watching these movies again, it's obvious that the Salkinds and the people they hired (and the people who succeeded them) didn't always get it, either. We've got Superman giving up his power and responsibility so he can get laid, we've got Superman beating up a bully for no compellingly good reason except for an immature ""gotcha"" moment that is unworthy of him, and we've got Superman casually letting Zod, Ursa, and Non die in the Arctic -- in Zod's case, by his own hand.

And then we've got Superman altering Lane's memories without her consent. Not just once, but twice. You can argue that the first one was to save her from the emotional trauma of dating Superman (though that's damned presumptuous of him) but the second time? He does it just so he can go on a consequence-free joyride with her and get her advice. To say that's appalling doesn't begin to cover it.

What's fascinating watching these movies again is that, in terms of general plot, the third one is actually the one that's the best straight-up Superman story. Webster is the perfect villain, a greedy industrialist, who uses his underlings to further his agenda at the expense of the common person. It's only too bad that the movie is dumber than a box of rocks, wasting a great actor in Robert Vaughn, not to mention the comic talents of Pamela Stephenson. (Stephenson was a brilliant comedian, but most people she worked for couldn't see past her looks, so she quit acting and comedy in disgust, and instead got her PhD in clinical psychology.) Richard Pryor didn't annoy me as much as I thought he would, mostly because he does have a certain amount of heart, and he's also actually funny, which is one up on most of what passes for comedy in the misbegotten third film.

Mostly the third movie shows absolutely no understanding of how computers work, which is a problem if that's what you're basing your plot on. On the other hand, the absurd slaptstick opening sequence makes it clear that nobody involved in making the film is taking it seriously, so why should we? Which is good, as the junkyard scene of Good Kent facing Evil Superman is not only idiotic and embarrassing, it goes on waaaaaaaaaay too long.

The first movie is, unsurprisingly, the strongest of the four, though even there you can see the seams from the lunatic process by which it and its sequel were both written and filmed. (It doesn't help that top-billed Marlon Brando can't even be arsed to do anything as good as phoning in his performance; he's a disaster, and substituting Susannah York's Lara for him in the second film is frankly something of a relief.) The opening on Krypton is actually quite well done, even with the drag effect of Brando's somnabulent line readings, the crystalline art direction for Krypton making Superman's home truly alien. The Smallville scenes are brief and effective (if you'd told me before this week that Glenn Ford was only actually in two scenes as Jonathan Kent, I'd have said you were lying; he created that much of an impression that it felt like he was in it more), and while Luthor's plan is pretty over-the-top and absurd (also, where does he get the resources to build an underground headquarters, fly around the country to alter missiles and steal Kryptonite, and so forth?), it still works, and has consequences. Superman going back in time to save Lane probably seemed like it would show the depths of their love, but mostly it just comes across as artificial suspense.

The second movie has much bigger problems. Terence Stamp and Gene Hackman make up for a lot of those flaws, as they're both superlative bad guys, if somewhat one-dimensional. Still, the moment when the president kneels down and mutters, ""Oh God,"" and the general corrects him, ""Zod!"" is one of the finest villain moments in superhero movie history.

But the fact that parts of this movie were filmed a year or more apart are evident in differing hairstyles and actors' weight and looks. The movie is at once serious and slapstick, with Non in particular made the butt of jokes for no compellingly good reason. (If you want to know what the movie would have been like had Donner finished it himself, one can get the ""Donner cut"" on DVD.)

Worse, though, is that Superman isn't a hero in most of this movie. The Eiffel Tower scene is pretty much it -- after that, he's too busy mooning over Lane to actually notice that three Kryptonians are wreaking havoc. And does he lure them out of the city right away to avoid people getting hurt? No, he stays in town so we can have the big fight in Metropolis before heading north.

Reeve does superlative work in these films. Forty years later, the effects don't look all that special, but they were cutting-edge for the time, and gave much more verisimilitude to Superman's powers. But what Reeve accomplished was something that nobody else who has played Superman in live action has truly managed: he made us believe a person could use a pair of glasses as a disguise. He did that by not relying on his outsized specs -- his posture, his body language, his voice, all of it changed when he was Kent. It remains one of the most effective dual-identity performances in the superhero pantheon, and it -- along with Reeve's general earnestness -- helps sell the movies and cover a multitude of sins.

Which is good, as the movies commit many. Despite their flaws, though, they did pave the way for more superhero movies in the theatre.

But before we dive into that, we'll be looking at some of the TV movies of the 1970s and 1980s released on either side of Reeve's efforts. Next week, Marvel's first attempts at Spider-Man and Dr. Strange."
322,322,"Cycle was an early partner with AWS and Google and its customers will be asked to move to Microsoft's cloud.

In a bit of a coup in the cloud computing world, Microsoft on Tuesday announced that it bought a startup called Cycle Computing for an undisclosed sum.

Cycle may not have the name recognition of some of its better-known tech peers, but the startup has played a crucial role in creating today's cloud computing industry. When businesses swipe a credit card today and instantly get access to unlimited supercomputing power, it's in large part thanks to Cycle.

Cycle Computing gained nationwide attention in 2012 when its technology transformed Amazon's then nascent Web Services into a supercomputer boasting the equivalent of 50,000 individual computers.

Scientists were trying to find potential new cancer drugs and they used Cycle's software to simultaneously run their app across tens of thousands of virtual computers in Amazon's datecenters. (Specifically, they used 6,700 Amazon EC2 instances to create a 51,132-core computer -- with each core is basically equivalent to a single computer). The setup was so powerful that it cost researchers $5,000 to run their AWS app for just one hour.

It was an early proving project for Amazon's AWS business which, back in 2012, was still trying to convince enterprises to give it a go. This project was pointed out by Amazon's cloud genius Werner Vogels as one of his most proud moments to date, he told Business Insider at the time.

In the years since, Cycle Computing grew to be used by all three of the big cloud vendors, AWS, Google and Microsoft Azure. Plus, a bunch of competitive products came onto the market that also let virtual cloud computers work together as if it were one massive supercomputer.

Flash forward to 2017 and there's now an entire market of such products called ""cloud orchestration,"" complete with its own consortium under the Linux Foundation, the ""Cloud Native Computing Foundation"" of which Cycle was a founding member. CNCF has grown so powerful that Microsoft and AWS bowed and joined it last week.

Microsoft did not disclose the terms of the sale and it's hard to guess because Cycle Computing was unusual in another way: it was bootstrapped, taking on zero VC funding. Cycle raised $1 million in debt financing in 2016.

Amazon CTO Werner VogelsAmazon

The founders ""started Cycle twelve years ago on an $8,000 credit card,"" founder and CEO Jason Stowe said in a blog post on Tuesday announcing the news.

So this could have been sweet exit for them and their employees, who own 100% of the company. Or it could have been an aqui-hire fire sale.

There's some reason to believe it was a happy exit. Cycle claims Novartis and NASA as marquee customers as well as a list of unnamed top companies in manufacturing, life insurance, pharma and biotech, media and financial services/hedge funds. Stowe says that all told, its customers are using the product to run the equivalent of ""1 billion core-hours this year, growing at 2.7x every 12 months,"" in other words, a billion hours of computing time and growing.

But here's the clincher: while Microsoft says it will continue to support all of Cycle's customers on their original cloud of choice like AWS or Google Cloud, future Cycle customers won't be given that option. And existing Cycle customers will be asked to move to Azure.

Microsoft says: ""We will continue to support Cycle Computing clients using AWS and/or Google Cloud. Future Microsoft versions released will be Azure only. Customers will be given assistance to migrate.""

And that's why this is brilliant. These are huge application that use a lot of cloud services and rack up big cloud computing bills. Microsoft is trying to boost usage of its cloud Azure. With this acquisition it gets to do that, while also encouraging AWS and Google customers to jump ship."
323,323,"Sophisticated software could help doctors make better diagnoses

Recently a middle-aged patient visited Seattle-based physician Thomas Payne complaining about substantial, unexpected weight loss and foot tingling. The doctor was puzzled -- those symptoms could indicate anything from an infection to dozens of more complex ailments, such as diabetes or cancer. So Payne, who also serves as medical director of information technology services at the University of Washington School of Medicine, did something unusual. After performing a standard physical examination and filling in his patient's medical record, he turned to an online tool -- DXplain -- for help.

Payne keyed in the symptoms, and the computer program suggested a handful of potential conditions, including a rare disease called amyloidosis, in which abnormal proteins build up in the body, interfering with normal organ function and causing nerve damage. Further exams and a biopsy at another institution confirmed the tip -- the patient was one of the roughly 4,000 people in the U.S. who receive this diagnosis every year.

Even five years ago, if Payne had been stumped about a case, he would have first turned to a trusted colleague or spent hours sifting through a mountain of textbooks and scientific research to puzzle out such an obscure diagnosis. DXplain draws on those same textbooks and peer-reviewed studies to make its own assessments -- but does so within seconds. ""Could I have come up with that same list of conditions? Perhaps if I thought long enough,"" says Payne, who more typically sees patients with the flu or arthritis than with inexplicable nerve damage. But, he warns, the scientific literature shows that ""when pressed for time, we don't sit down and think about these things like we should, and then those diagnoses may be missed.""

Such misses are too common, according to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which published major reports on the causes of medical errors in 1999 and 2015. Some of these errors can arise from poor record keeping or miscommunication. But often misdiagnosis is to blame. Reviews of medical transcripts suggest that between 6 and 17 percent of adverse events in hospitals can be tied to mistaken diagnoses. The National Academies' 2015 report estimated that 10 percent of patient deaths in the U.S. result from these incorrect conclusions -- and the corresponding inappropriate treatment.

Among the solutions that the academies recommended was that hospitals and clinicians should employ more tools -- formally referred to as clinical decision-support systems -- that might help improve their decision making. At its most basic level, that could mean following a checklist to avoid skipping key steps in important routines. A growing number of medical schools, teaching hospitals and other care centers are also paying for computer-based assistance such as DXplain or its competitors VisualDx and Isabel. Right now VisualDx, the most popular diagnostic support system, is licensed at more than 1,600 hospitals and clinics across the U.S., according to its manufacturer.

The clinical decision-support industry says its wares can help clinicians confirm their diagnoses or suggest alternatives. But physicians have not exactly embraced the new tools with open arms. The big question is whether adopting such software solutions will substantially enhance the practice of medicine or simply add another unnecessary complication to doctors' already pressed schedules.

The idea of enlisting computers to help inform medical diagnoses is not new. The first computing efforts that targeted clinicians' errors began in the 1970s. Then, in the mid-1980s, Massachusetts General Hospital began working on DXplain with the goal of helping to improve diagnoses. The approach seemed promising, but it did not actually take off at the time, partly because patient records were still being written by hand, and turning to a computer-based program added another cumbersome step.

A lot has happened since then. Computers are now integral to standard medicine. They have taken over record keeping in most clinics, hospitals and private practices, with encouragement from federal incentives. Such shifts have boosted quality, safety and efficiency in the health care system.

The clinical decision-support systems have changed, too. They have become much faster and often link directly to the studies from which they draw, allowing clinicians to quickly assess evidence and learn more about the potential diagnosis. VisualDx, for that matter, highlights its ""visual"" aspect -- it includes diagrams of what body parts may be affected and pictures of maladies for easier comparison.

Crucially, scientists have also learned more about why people make certain kinds of mistakes and how to counteract them. Researchers have identified a number of cognitive traps into which physicians sometimes fall when making a diagnosis. One that seems particularly amenable to correction by computers is the so-called anchoring error. Studies suggest that doctors often get stuck on the first diagnosis that occurs to them -- the anchor -- even if it is wrong. Then they may subconsciously give greater weight to any information that reinforces that diagnosis and dismiss -- or not even bother to look for -- other data.

In a busy hospital ward or medical practice, anchoring errors can happen for myriad reasons. A harried clinician may forget to ask if a patient recently traveled even when that answer could substantially change the likely diagnosis -- resulting in situations where, for example, an Ebola patient might be sent home from a hospital with instructions to take Tylenol for a high fever and pain rather than being quarantined and provided immediate care. Still other problems may stem from the way doctors are educated. Often students are given case studies that reflect prototypical symptoms rather than real-world complexities. Textbook cases are not as common as one might think.

That kind of discrepancy is where these systems hope to find their sweet spot. Each program employs proprietary algorithms to link symptoms with diagnoses and flag which conditions may be most likely or most dangerous and so need to be ruled out quickly. Some are even capable of automatically pulling information from a patient's current electronic records, thereby reducing the need for doctors to reenter the same information.

Just how much decision-support programs would slash errors, however, remains hard to estimate. But preliminary data look promising. A 2011 study of VisualDx compared how well emergency room doctors at two different institutions were able to diagnose a particular skin infection with and without computer assistance. Clinicians who used VisualDx made the correct diagnosis 64 percent of the time. Those who did not made the correct diagnosis only 14 percent of the time. A preliminary study of Isabel presented at a conference in 2014 concluded that the service improved the ability of 40 medical students to make accurate diagnoses by as much as a third. A study of DXplain, published in 2010, found that when residents at the Mayo Clinic used it with diagnostically complex cases, the program dramatically decreased medical costs because it led to shorter, more effective hospital stays.

Nevertheless, beneficial changes are often slow in coming. In July the National Academies held a one-day meeting to check on progress in reducing diagnostic errors. John Ball, the physician who chaired the academies' 2015 report, said ahead of the meeting that he expected ""disappointing"" results because many of the recommendations to reduce error -- including greater use of computerized decision-making tools -- have not yet been adopted on a large scale. Ball says his own seven-hospital system in North Carolina has not yet made much progress integrating these systems into its care.

Part of the problem in North Carolina, Ball notes, is that the various hospitals and doctors in his network work with different electronic record-keeping systems and protocols, which makes it impossible to standardize such changes. The other issue, he says, is that doctors may be reluctant to spend time learning the system until they are certain that it will be worth it.

Institutional inertia is an issue across the U.S., observes Mark Graber, president and co-founder of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine. ""Health care organizations don't really 'own' the problem of diagnostic error and don't recognize it as something they need to focus on,"" he says. ""Physicians, in general, think they are doing a good job and think they don't really need to worry about [it].""

In addition, some experts, such as Sandra Fryhofer, a past president of the American College of Physicians and a practicing internist in Atlanta, fear that widespread adoption of these programs might have unintended consequences. If such software becomes more accessible to patients, she worries that they may forgo a doctor's visit because they think they already know what is wrong or, alternatively, needlessly fret because the program suggests a scary result -- something that doctors say happens now when people search for their symptoms on the Internet.

Doctors such as Payne say they are not concerned about being replaced, however. What they envision is a safer, smarter approach -- like the complex backup systems in a plane's cockpit. They hope that with such built-in redundancies and cues, perhaps they can chart a more reliable, smoother course for us all."
324,324,"The ambitions of Barcelona's Supercomputing Center stretch well beyond the newly-operational MareNostrum 4.

Barcelona's Supercomputing Center is aiming to lead the move in Europe from petascale to exascale computing -- one exaflops is 1,000 petaflops -- and the newly launched MareNostrum 4 is just part of that shift.

The €34m ($40m) MareNostrum 4, which recently began operations, is the third fastest supercomputer in Europe and occupies 13th place in the Top500 list of the world's high-performance computing systems.

It provides 11.1 petaflops for scientific research, 10 times more than MareNostrum 3, which was installed between 2012 and 2013. One petaflops is one thousand million million floating-point operations per second.

That performance means the new supercomputer will be able to deal more quickly with tasks relating to climate change, gravitational waves, fusion energy, AIDS vaccines, and new radiotherapy treatments to fight cancer.

On top of that power, the capacity of the general-purpose cluster is also due to be upgraded in the next few months with the addition of three new smaller-scale clusters. The general-purpose cluster is the largest and most powerful part of the supercomputer, consisting of 48 racks with 3,456 nodes and 155,000 processors.

The new clusters will be equipped with emerging technologies developed in the US and Japan, such as IBM Power9 and NVIDIA Volta Plus GPUs, Intel Knights Hill processors or 64-bit ARMv8 processors, used in powerful supercomputers such as American Summit, Sierra, Theta and Aurora, and Japanese Post-K.

Those additions will bring MareNostrum 4's total speed up to 13.7 petaflops. For comparison, the system occupying seventh place in the Top500, Japan's Joint Center for Advanced High Performance Computing Oakforest-PACS, offers 13.5 petaflops.

MareNostrum 4's storage capacity will also increase to 14 petabytes. However, despite those processing and storage additions, its energy consumption will only increase by 30 percent to 1.3MW per year.

""For our researchers in computer architecture, and in the programming and creation of tools for the analysis and efficiency of computers, this a treat,"" BSC director professor Mateo Valero tells ZDNet.

""It will allow us to experiment with cutting-edge technologies, analyze how the same applications behave in different hardware, and tackle the challenge of making them efficient in different architectures.

Valero said the upcoming changes will also enable BSC to test the suitability of these technological developments for future iterations of MareNostrum.

""It will also allow us to address one of our most ambitious projects: our participation in the creation of hardware and software technology with a European DNA,"" he says.

For the first time, the European Commission is supporting that goal. Last March, seven European countries including Spain signed a formal declaration to support Europe's leadership in high-performance computing, a project of the size of Airbus in the 1990s and of Galileo in the 2000s.

At the time of the declaration, Andrus Ansip, European Commission vice-president for the digital single market, said that if Europe stays dependent on others for this critical resource, then it risks getting technologically ""locked, delayed, or deprived of strategic know-how"".

'Technological sovereignty' is about being technologically independent, so that you have control of your research and development, which can be particularly important for national security.

BSC plans to capitalize on the achievements and knowledge of its researchers to create European processors for supercomputing, the automotive industry, and the Internet of Things.

Of course, the transition to exascale computing requires an implementation roadmap. According to Valero., BSC doesn't expect to have an exaflops machine in 2020, but Europe could and should have one in 2022 or 2023."
325,325,"ANN ARBOR, MI - People who've been holding out in recent years and opposing the installation of new digital electric meters on their homes are now having their power shut off by DTE Energy.

Dozens of people from southeast Michigan and beyond gathered to protest DTE's actions on Monday, Aug. 14, outside the Ann Arbor home of Linda Kurtz, director of the Smart Meter Education Network.

Kurtz said she's aware of at least 11 people in Ann Arbor who recently received shutoff notices from DTE because of their resistance to converting to new meter technology. Of the eight who are still resisting, she said, four had their power shut off on Monday.

Kurtz, a 55-year-old craniosacral therapist, and others who demonstrated on her property are concerned about electromagnetic fields generated by so-called ""smart meters."" They argue the radio frequencies are harmful to human health and are especially distressing for people with electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

Some also worry the data collected by smart meters could give DTE and third parties private information about their home life.

DTE maintains there is no merit to the concerns, and it notes customers can opt out of the smart-meter program for a fee and receive new digital meters that don't wirelessly transmit usage data like the more advanced smart meters.

Kurtz and others argue the digital ""opt-out meters"" are still bad, though, and they think people should be given a choice to keep their analog meters that don't generate ""dirty electricity.""

""I have a meter that functions perfectly,"" said Kurtz, who has a locking device on her analog meter to prevent DTE from replacing it.

""They need to allow people like me who are harmed ... to keep an analog meter,"" Kurtz argues.

Consumers Energy to finish smart meter installation in 2017

Based on a shutoff notice she received from DTE, Kurtz was expecting to have her power shut off on Monday, and she even set up a power generator in preparation, but DTE never came to her house. Protesters said they saw a DTE truck parked around the corner, though, and they figured the crowd of protesters maybe turned DTE away.

Signs with messages such as ""smart meters are making people sick"" were placed around Kurtz's front yard, where protesters lingered for hours. One sign referred to DTE as ""Dirty Toxic Electricity.""

Some of the demonstrators asked visitors to either leave their cell phones behind in their cars or wrap them in aluminum foil.

DTE spokeswoman Randi Berris said the Detroit-based utility is close to completing its conversion to digital meters and expects to have the project, which started in 2008, completed by the end of this year. She said she didn't have information about specific customers or how many people are impacted by the round of shutoffs that Kurtz and other smart-meter opponents are complaining about.

Berris said the smart-meter technology allows DTE to read a meter without entering a customer's yard, home or business. She said the readings are sent to DTE via mobile communication technology and then used to produce bills that are more accurate than estimated bills, ensuring customers only pay for the energy they use.

Berris said the new meters also provide customers with up-to-date information to better track and manage energy consumption, and they allow faster and more reliable outage detection and restoration through remote monitoring of the distribution network.

Laszlo Slomovits, a member of the Ann Arbor musical duo Gemini, said he's among those who had his power shut off by DTE on Monday for refusing to convert to a digital meter.

""I have a generator, so I'm OK for now, but it's obviously not a long-term solution,"" he said, acknowledging he plans to call DTE and have his power restored, which means getting a digital meter.

He and others said they're still hoping the Michigan Legislature will pass House Bill 4220, which is backed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Rep. Adam Zemke, D-Ann Arbor. It would allow utility customers the choice of keeping a traditional analog meter.

Ann Arbor resident Debra Wilcox said DTE also shut off her power on Monday and she's not sure what she's going to do now. She's not interested in powering her home with a generator.

""DTE has been trying to force all of us to have an AMI meter, which they call the smart meter,"" she said, raising concerns that they're not safe and pump ""dirty energy"" through the house.

""They're bullies,"" she said, holding a copy of the Aug. 4 shutoff notice she received from DTE.

""We have made several attempts to contact you to gain access to our metering equipment in order to upgrade our electric meter,"" the letter read. ""We have not received a response to the previous correspondence we sent you. Therefore, we will proceed with exercising our right to disconnect your electric service.

""Please be advised that the electric service is scheduled for disconnection on or after August 14, 2017.""

The letter went on to say Wilcox may be required to pay a fee to restore service if she didn't act to prevent the shutoff.

""If you would like to enroll in our Opt-Out Program, then please make us aware of that decision when you contact us. This program allows for a non-transmitting, (radio off) advanced meter to be installed and the following fees will be assessed to your account.""

Under the opt-out program, a meter reader stops by monthly to read a digital meter, and those opting to go that route must pay an initial opt-out fee of $67.20, plus $9.80 per month.

""Please note that providing access to our metering equipment is not optional,"" the DTE shutoff notice emphasized.

Wilcox said it's inaccurate for DTE to claim she wasn't allowing access to her meter. She said she allows access to read her meter, but she just isn't letting DTE replace it with a new digital meter.

She said she's not as sensitive as some are to electromagnetic fields, but she's worried it could mess up her sleep cycle.

People in attendance for Monday's demonstration came from across southeast Michigan and beyond, including some from Sterling Heights, Warren, Shelby Township, Grand Blanc and Lapeer.

Kurtz said some of the Ann Arborites who had their power shut off on Monday are in their 80s and 90s.

Milt and Joan Johnson came from Howell for Monday's demonstration in Ann Arbor. They said they still have an analog meter on their home and they don't want a digital one because they're worried about exposure to electromagnetic frequencies.

""Our meter is about six feet from my bed. I don't want to be bathed in that 24-7,"" Milt said. ""I want to stay healthy.""

Joan added, ""I've already got health issues and I don't want to get more. I've got blood-pressure problems.""

They said they're concerned about everything from headaches to heart attacks, strokes and cancer.

""It affects different people differently,"" Milt said.

They're now thinking about what they're going to do if DTE decides to shut off their power next.

Michigan residents link smart meters to medical problems, testify in front of legislative committee

Berris, DTE's spokeswoman, said the customers who are having their power shut off denied DTE access to their meters and received multiple communications asking them to comply.

Under a Michigan Public Service Commission rule, she said, customers are required to arrange access for inspection, meter reading, maintenance or replacement of equipment, or meter removal.

""As a customer-focused company, DTE Energy is committed to providing our customers with safe, reliable, affordable energy,"" she said in a statement provided via email. ""To support that commitment, we have installed nearly 3 million electric smart meters to improve service, provide more accurate readings and allow our customers to have better control over their own energy use. DTE Energy believes there is absolutely no merit to the concerns raised by some individuals about smart meters, and we remain confident in the safety, security and benefits provided by the meters.""

Berris said DTE recognizes smart meters are an emotional issue for some customers.

""The relatively weak strength of radio frequency signals generated by smart meters means that any impact of RF exposure is minimal -- similar to the levels of exposure from TVs and radios,"" she said. ""In fact, other common electric devices, such as cell phones, baby monitors, wireless routers, laptop computers and microwave ovens all produce more radio frequency exposure than smart meters.""

Kurtz said she's been actively opposing smart meters for the last five years because she's extremely sensitive to the frequencies. For her, she said, it can cause insomnia, heart palpitations, ringing in her ears, headaches, fatigue, depression, vision problems and more.

""I am highly electrosensitive, and my home is the only relatively safe place that I have to be in,"" she said. ""So my house has aluminum siding, my windows are either fully or partially screened, and I have now screened half of my attic as well.

""So the amount of radio frequency radiation in my house is much lower than it would be otherwise.""

Kurtz said she met a woman in 2012 who couldn't have a cell phone in her house and she thought, ""Really?""

""Well, I'm that person now,"" she said. ""It's very hard to believe that this is an issue until you either know someone who is experiencing it or you experience it yourself. So, the opt-out meter is a computerized meter. That generates dirty electricity, and dirty electricity is this very spiky, pulsing, electromagnetic field, so it has highs and lows and in-betweens. It's just bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam.

""This is something that, for some people, it's not a choice. This is about health. This is like if you have a peanut allergy. They are expecting me to be in my home essentially 24 hours a day, seven days a week, exposed to this stuff. I can't do it.""

Kurtz said she's expecting DTE to follow through on shutting off her power in the next day or two, after which she plans to use a power generator just enough to dehumidify her basement, keep her refrigerator cold and occasionally do some laundry.

She's still not sure what she's going to do as winter approaches. She said she might move out of Michigan if she doesn't have an option to keep an analog meter on her house."
